Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nA task force has been created to revise Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plan, addressing concerns from the Nepali Congress party regarding funding and implementation, ahead of Prime Minister KP Oli's upcoming visit to China.\nNumerous districts in Nepal, including Kathmandu Valley, are at high risk for cholera outbreaks due to poor sanitation and hygiene, necessitating surveillance and vaccination efforts along with water and sanitation improvements to eliminate the disease.\nRastriya Swatantra Party faces turmoil after arrest of its president, Rabi Lamichhane, on embezzlement charges, leading to confusion and changes in protest strategy, putting its future in jeopardy.\nDespite a government ban on construction in the Budhi Gandaki hydropower project area, Gandaki province allocated funds to pave a road to Arughat Bazaar, affecting the project's progress, resettlement, and local livelihoods, particularly in Arughat Bazaar, which faces declining business and population exodus due to stalled development and unresolved land acquisition issues.\nHaving to choose between saving the mother or the child during a complicated pregnancy is a trope adopted by many movies and plays as their narrative crux. Adopting such tropes simplifies the plot, adding nothing but predictable melodrama.Directed by Kedar Shrestha and produced by Dayahang Rai, the play ‘DhukDhuki 72 Megahertz’ revolves around the same theme. However, its layered narrative breaks free from cliched storytelling. The play opens with the wife (Menuka Pradhan) caressing her baby bump. Her husband (Karma) enters the stage, and affectionate banter follows. The couple shares their views on life, patriarchy, motherhood, and love. As the conversation unfolds to its depth, the audience learns that the wife is a teacher interested in writing poetry, while the husband is an artist by profession. During their conversation, the actors explore ongoing yet concealed discourses about patriarchy. This dismantles the belief that men alone are the enforcers of patriarchy. It highlights how patriarchal settings influence women to think and act in a patriarchal way, manifesting in their behaviour and beliefs. As the play progresses, lighting stands out as a powerful tool. It complements the depth of the dialogues, which are rich in literature and philosophy. One dialogue, “To understand light, one must first experience darkness,” is accompanied by the husband lighting the dim stage. This lighting shift shows the synchrony between the stage setting and the dialogues.In one scene, the couple is preparing for a maternity photoshoot. The husband teases his wife, questioning the ideologies she once subscribed to. The wife says with conviction, “The heart has defeated the mind. I want to experience the full essence of motherhood.”Her dialogue reflects the inner complexities of human beings, which are as sublime as a river. This scene taps into human beings’ raw and unfiltered nature, which is untainted and untouched by the weight of any ideological grandeur.Through the exchange of dialogues between the wife and the husband, the writer of this play is also seen to be critiquing the audience’s tendency to seek definitive interpretations of art instead of trusting their understanding. This is evident when the husband complains to his wife about a visitor at his art exhibition, who keeps hurling questions at him about his artwork. This scene reminded me of the time when I watched the movie ‘Shambhala’. After the film’s end, a viewer asked the cast what happened at the end, hinting at a need for closure rather than relying on their interpretation of the film. As the couple prepares for their photoshoot, the husband kisses his wife’s baby bump, saying, “Even husbands have some elements of motherhood in them.” This scene scored laughter from the audience. Through this scene, the director was clever enough to satirise such men who contribute little at home yet consider themselves paragons of balance between work and family. As the play progresses to its main plot, the wife is admitted to the hospital. The husband receives devastating news about complications in his wife’s pregnancy. The play now deals with a difficult juncture: is the baby to be saved or the mother?The wife decides to save the baby. Next, the duo argue, during which the husband questions her willingness to leave him behind. However, the wife firmly defends her agency, asserting her right to decide for her body. After this scene, the extensive cries and wallows may lead one to perceive the play as celebrating women asserting their rights. However, the true beauty of the play lies in its refusal to glorify any particular theme. Instead, it presents the reality of individuals navigating their ideologies and emotions.The wife epitomises the idea that ‘you cannot philosophise your way out of a traffic jam,’ which means that one’s feelings and innate experiences shape and dictate the paths for us to walk on.The long pauses taken by the cast amplify the essence of the play, allowing them to immerse themselves in the emotions they convey on stage. For instance, after putting on a brave face about the complications of the pregnancy in front of his wife, the husband breaks down alone in the hospital. This scene acts as a cathartic release, both for the character and the audience.The stage design remains consistent throughout the play, with elements creatively adapted to serve multiple purposes. A prominent feature is the tree in the middle of the stage. It acts as a symbol of many things. Initially, the tree represents nature and serves as a space where the wife and the husband share their deepest feelings. Similarly, the picture of the baby in the womb is projected in the tree, depicting the natural essence of childbirth. In grief, the wife always goes near the tree and converses with herself. Her inclination towards the tree reflects her need for connection to the natural world.Likewise, both characters' conversation about love takes the form of a tough love talk. During one exchange, the wife defines love as “Something to be felt, and that feeling is never going to be lost.” This subjectifies the definition of love. In this way, the play has tried to give meaning to the undefined emotion of love.The play's thematic resonance occurs when the audience is made to see the vision seen by the wife. In her vision, the wife hears her baby speaking to her while still in the womb. When she asks how the child can speak, the child explains that it can communicate and feel everything the mother feels through the umbilical cord.This connection is akin to a radio—when plugged in, it plays music. The radio serves a recurring role throughout the play, with a love song by Kumar Sanu being played. Just as the radio connects to the music, the umbilical cord connects the mother and child, much like the baby’s voice, which can be seen as a love song for the mother.This is where the concept of ‘DhukDhuki’ ties in. For many, hearing Kumar Sanu’s love song makes their DhukDhuki (heartbeat) rise. For mothers, hearing their baby’s voice is their true ‘DhukDhuki’, a heartbeat of love and connection.The wife talks about how ‘DhukDhuki’ is a metaphor for life’s continuity. For her, the DhukDhuki symbolises the growing baby inside her, once again reflecting the natural process of life. In this sense, the baby represents nature’s everlasting cycle, and the love the wife has for her child symbolises the importance of love, highlighting how essential love is in an individual's life.The play, which runs for 90 minutes with just two actors, is an exemplary display of artistry. The actor’s ability to laugh and cry convincingly on stage deserves commendation.The story suits anyone looking to forget societal norms and expectations and immerse themselves in a deeply cathartic experience.DhukDhuki 72 MegahertzDirector: Kedar ShresthaCast: Menuka Pradhan, KarmaWhere: Mandala Theatre, Thapagaun, KathmanduShowtimes: Every day at 5:30 pm (except Monday) and an extra 1:00 pm show on Saturday until December 1.  \nNepal faces challenges in balancing free speech protection with regulating fake news and misinformation online, as exemplified by the arrest of Durga Prasai for falsely accusing the Prime Minister, prompting concerns about the Social Media Bill that may undermine free speech.\nNepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba is a man of few words. He rarely makes public statements, and when he does, his remarks are peculiarly straightforward, lacking subtext.Yet, a recent comment he made—that the KP Oli government is doing a good job—stood out. Despite its brevity, the comment carried a hint of hidden meaning.One may wonder how Deuba, who has himself served as prime minister and is angling for a sixth term, would explain just what “good job” the Oli government has done so far. In fact, in the more than four months since Deuba elevated Oli to the prime minister’s seat, the coalition has yet to deliver anything that justifies such a claim.The current government has fallen short on nearly every front, mirroring the failures of the previous administration under Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal. So why, then, is Deuba so enthusiastically heaping praise on Oli, his long-time political adversary?More than meets the eyeDeuba has a long political history, and his contributions to democratic changes cannot be ignored. But he is not the man who inspires hope. His five previous stints as prime minister were marred by governance failures and a general lack of vision. Deuba, however, has a reputation as a shrewd political player, just like his contemporaries—Oli and Dahal. But there is a contrast. He is adept at manoeuvring in the shadows and pulling off backroom deals. The other two are more loquacious, outspoken and effervescent, with their political strategies often playing out in full public view.Securing a power-sharing deal with Oli was nothing short of a masterstroke for Deuba, especially since he did so at a time when his party members, particularly the two general secretaries, were vehemently opposed to joining a coalition government until the next elections. Yet, he offered the government leadership to the wily Oli on a platter while managing to quell the dissenters.Some Congress leaders privately admit that Deuba’s intentions are often difficult to discern, given his tendency to talk less and keep his cards close. In the 2022 elections, Congress was voted as the single largest party, making it the natural claimant to the government, yet it has been content, or been forced to be, to play second fiddle. It’s not difficult to comprehend the unease Deuba may have been going through for not being able to wield power as the head of the government.The silence of the criticsDeuba knows in his heart that Oli is not a man to be trusted, yet his submission to the latter is befuddling. Interestingly, the same general secretaries who tirelessly opposed Congress’s involvement in a coalition are now conspicuously silent, even offering to facilitate Deuba’s pathway to a sixth term. Their uncanny silence appears to have given Deuba free rein in the party.Gagan Thapa, one of the general secretaries who fiercely advocated for staying in the opposition until the next elections, now seems to have muted his voice—perhaps in hopes of eventually leading the party himself in return for helping Deuba secure the top job.What’s also intriguing is that Thapa has chosen not to raise issues of corruption, irregularities and governance failures with the same intensity he used to until a few months ago. A vocal critic of the so-called political mechanisms that coalition parties often institute to oversee government functions, Thapa has now consented to be part of a similar mechanism formed by Oli and Deuba. He seems to have realised that it’s better to play along with Deuba, as exhausting energy on stopping him from becoming prime minister—as long as Oli keeps his promise—is an effort wasted.Those rooting for Thapa may argue that the general secretary is now in a “strength-building” exercise, with his sights set on the next general convention. However, in Congress, where factionalism runs deep, the future is uncertain. Thapa, long seen as a leader who could inject new ideas into Congress and steer the party in the right direction, risks becoming a spent force due to his vacillations and ambivalence, as well as external factors. The rise of independent candidates and new political forces, particularly the Rastriya Swatantra Party, has become a formidable challenge. While Thapa’s struggle within the party is immense, he faces competition not only from the old guard but also from the new wave.On the question of credibility, public trust in Congress, UML and the Maoist Centre is at an all-time low. Nepali voters view the major parties as tainted and corrupt. Even if one argues that a leader’s personal integrity is separate from their political record, the two are intrinsically linked. It’s not enough for politicians to be clean; they must also appear clean.How long Thapa can sustain his fight for change remains to be seen. The last temptationDeuba’s power rests firmly in his hold over the party. But in the coming days, the dynamics within Congress are bound to change, and he wants to forge the path to Baluwatar while the party is still under his control. He knows that, in time, the party mantle needs to be passed to the next generation.Just shy of 80, Deuba faces what is likely his last chance at power—a chance that is wholly contingent on Oli. Despite being well aware of Oli’s infamous unpredictability, Deuba sees him as his best bet for securing one more term.Still, Deuba has yet to make a convincing case for what he might accomplish if he makes it to Singha Durbar with Oli’s support. Of all people, he understands the challenges of running a coalition, especially with a partner as unpredictable as Oli. Yet, Deuba is a patient man. His reticence works to his advantage. He knows well that a little flattery costs nothing, and he has been generously showering it on Oli. So “democratic and liberal” is Deuba that he easily shakes off criticism and doesn’t mind being called submissive if it means his ultimate goal—the prime ministerial seat—remains within reach. A party for posterity, however, does not seem to be at the top of his agenda. The grand old party seems to be sinking, dragged down by Deuba’s questionable allegiance to Oli in pursuit of personal ambitions. \nFrom Iraq to Afghanistan to the US, basic freedoms for women are being eroded as governments start rolling back existing laws.Just a few months ago a ban on Afghan women speaking in public was the latest measure introduced by the Taliban, who took back control of the country in 2021. From August the ban included singing, reading aloud, reciting poetry and even laughing outside their homes.The Taliban’s ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice, which implements one of the most radical interpretations of Islamic law, enforces these rules. They are part of a broader set of “vice and virtue” laws that severely restrict women’s rights and freedoms. Women are even banned from reading the Quran out loud to other women in public.In the past three years in Afghanistan, the Taliban has taken away many basic rights from women who live there, so that there’s very little that they are allowed to do. From 2021, the Taliban started introducing restrictions on girls receiving education, starting with a ban on coeducation and then a ban on girls attending secondary schools. This was followed by closing blind girls’ schools in 2023, and making it mandatory for girls in grades four to six (ages nine to 12) to cover their faces on the way to school.Women can no longer attend universities or receive a degree certificate nationally, or follow midwifery or nursing training in the Kandahar region. Women are no longer allowed to be flight attendants, or to take a job outside the home. Women-run bakeries in the capital Kabul have now been banned. Women are mostly now unable to earn any money, or leave their homes. In April 2024, the Taliban in Helmand province told media outlets to even refrain from airing women’s voices.Afghanistan is ranked last on the Women, Peace and Security Index and officials at the UN and elsewhere have called it “gender apartheid”. Afghan women are putting their lives on the line—facing surveillance, harassment, assault, arbitrary detention, torture and exile—to protest against the Taliban.Many diplomats discuss how important it is to “engage” with the Taliban, yet this has not stopped the assault on women’s rights. When diplomats “engage”, they tend to focus on counter-terrorism, counternarcotics, business deals, or hostage returns. Despite everything that has happened to Afghan women over a short period, critics suggest this rarely makes it onto diplomats’ priority list.Iraq’s age of consentMeanwhile, in Iraq, on August 4 2024, an amendment to Iraq’s 1959 personal status law which would possibly lower the age of consent for marriage to nine years old from 18 (or 15 with permission from a judge and parents) was proposed by member of parliament Ra’ad al-Maliki and supported by conservative Shia factions in the government.The law would have the potential of having matters of family law—such as marriage—adjudicated by religious authorities. This change could not only legalise child marriage but also strip women of rights related to divorce, child custody and inheritance.Iraq already has a high rate of underage marriage, with 7 percent of girls married by 15 years old, and 28 percent married before the legal age of 18. Unregistered marriages, not legally recorded in court but conducted through religious or tribal authorities, prevent girls from accessing civil rights, and leave women and girls vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and neglect, with limited options for seeking justice.Many women’s groups have already mobilised against the law. But the amendment has passed its second reading in parliament. If introduced, it could pave the way for further modifications that deepen sectarian divides and move the country further away from a unified legal system. It would also be an especially troubling step backward in protecting children’s rights and gender equality.Abortion rights in the USMeanwhile, in the US, women’s access to abortion has been eroded significantly in the past few years. In late 2021, the US was officially labelled a backsliding democracy by an international thinktank. Six months later, the landmark US Supreme Court ruling of Roe v Wade, which had safeguarded the constitutional right to abortion for nearly 50 years, was overturned. This led to a cascade of restrictive laws, with more than a quarter of US states enacting outright bans or severe restrictions on abortion.Republican US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene suggested, in May 2022, that women should stay celibate if they did not want to get pregnant. If only all women had that choice. In fact, in the US a sexual assault occurs every 68 seconds. One in every five American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape. From 2009-13, US Child Protective Services agencies found strong evidence indicating that 63,000 children per year were victims of sexual abuse.These developments reflect a troubling pattern. There is evidence from Donald Trump’s first term that there could be further erosion of women’s rights in his second presidency. During his previous term there were significant attempts to weaken healthcare access, with his foreign policy reinstating the “global gag rule” restricting access to women’s reproductive healthcare worldwide via funding conditions.Fragility of women’s rightsIf the world can tolerate the Taliban’s abuses, Iraq’s restrictive laws and the US restrictions on abortion access, it reveals the fragility of women’s and girls’ rights globally, and how easy it is to take them away.The UN agency, UN Women, says it could take another 286 years to close the global gender gaps in legal protections. No country has yet achieved gender equality, based on the gender pay gap, legal equality and social inequality levels. Women and girls continue to face discrimination in all corners of the world, and it seems to be getting worse. But despite everything women continue to resist.—The ConversationRead the original article here. \nThe inauguration of an immigration office at Korala border point in Upper Mustang’s Lo Manthang on October 30 had given a message of improved connectivity with the northern neighbour. But the excitement didn’t last as the office, opened with fanfare, was closed without delivering service for a single day. While unveiling the commemorative plaque, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak was flanked by a group of high profile officials. Gandaki Province Chief Minister Surendra Raj Pandey, heads of three security agencies, director general of the immigration department, among others, landed at Lo Manthang to attend the function. No sooner had the VIPs returned to Kathmandu, other officials deployed there also decamped as Tihar festival began the next day. But they didn’t go back even after the end of the festivities citing the biting cold of the high mountain. Nepal has kept the border facility closed since the inauguration citing severe cold. This is a lame excuse. The weather didn’t suddenly turn cold there, nor has the situation on the ground worsened due to a natural disaster or other unforeseen events. Everyone knew that Korala border point, which is situated at an altitude of 4,650 metres, would witness a freezing cold in the winter. The authorities should have prepared before the inauguration. By contrast, the offices on the Chinese side are operating just fine.Bringing the immigration and other offices into operation at Lo Manthang is important as the Korala border point not only connects Nepal and China but also has a potential to be a trilateral trade junction between Nepal, India and China. Nepal has been building the Kaligandaki Corridor national pride project that connects the Siddhartha Highway in the south to Korala in the north. When the road is complete, the route from Nepal-India border point at Sunauli to Nepal-China border point at Korala through Siddhartha Highway and Kaligandaki corridor can be an alternative trilateral trade route linking the three countries. While important religious destinations such as Lumbini and Muktinath are on the route, it also connects Nepal’s important cities including Pokhara and Chitwan.Failure to bring this border point into operation has multiple effects. First, it undermines the route’s huge potential. Second, it leaves a bad impression on the Chinese. Indian, Chinese, and other countries that have been supporting us have a serious concern about Nepal’s negligence in development works. We sign agreements or inaugurate projects with a lot of noise, but don’t work on their maintenance or sustainability.Closure of Korala immigration is a case in point. Several projects started with Indian support have met with similar fate. India’s railway company constructed the Kurta-Bijalpura rail section and handed over the rail line to the Nepal Railway Company Limited last year. It has since been helping operate the train as Nepal is still to train its own staff to run the train.As Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli works on a wish list to be presented before Chinese leaders during his Beijing visit in the first week of December, such failure in bilateral initiatives weaken Nepal’s position. When Nepal seeks other countries’ support in its development endeavours, it must at least be ready to shoulder its share of responsibility. India and China have shown ability in infrastructure development, both at home and abroad. By failing to do even the bare minimum to take them into confidence, Nepal is severely undercutting its development prospects.  \nTaragaon Regency Hotels Limited, operating under the international chain Hyatt in Boudha, Kathmandu, has been recognised as the highest taxpayer in the tourism sector for the fiscal year 2023/24 by the Inland Revenue Department.The hotel has previously been recognised multiple times as the top tax-paying company in the tourism sector in fiscal years 2014/15, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20.Additionally, the government of Nepal recognised the hotel in 2019 for contributing the highest amount of foreign currency earnings in the tourism sector.According to Corporate President Rani Bang, the hotel with 303 rooms, provides direct employment to approximately 325 people.“The hotel has been significantly contributing to Nepal’s tourism industry for over two decades by attracting high-end tourists, reflecting Nepali art and style,” she said.  \nNorthvolt, the Swedish maker of battery cells for electric vehicles, said on Thursday it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US, dealing a blow to Europe’s hopes that its most developed battery player would reduce Western car makers’ reliance on Chinese rivals.Northvolt said it has only enough cash to support operations for about a week and said it has secured $100 million in new financing for the bankruptcy process. It said operations will continue as normal during the bankruptcy.“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition, filed in US Bankruptcy Court in Houston. The company, which has operations in California, has about $30 million of cash, which can support its operations for only about a week. It has $5.8 billion in debts.Northvolt, which employs around 6,600 staff across seven countries, said it expects to complete the restructuring by the first quarter of 2025.Northvolt transformed in a matter of months from Europe’s best shot at a homegrown electric-vehicle battery champion to a company struggling to stay afloat by slimming down, hobbled by production problems, the loss of a major customer and a lack of funding.Europe has been hoping that Northvolt would reduce Western car makers’ reliance on Chinese rivals such as battery maker CATL, and EV and battery maker BYD.Northvolt said the $100 million in a new loan is part of $245 million in financing support for the bankruptcy. Swedish truck maker Scania, a shareholder and its biggest customer said on Thursday that it was loaning $100 million to Northvolt to support the manufacturing of electric vehicle battery cells in Skellefteå, northern Sweden.“This decisive step will allow Northvolt to continue its mission to establish a homegrown, European industrial base for battery production,” Tom Johnstone, interim chairman of Northvolt’s board, said in a statement, noting the support Northvolt has received from existing lenders and customers.As part of the restructuring, Northvolt will evaluate proposals for new money investment from strategic and financial investors, as well as existing lenders, shareholders and customers, he said.Volkswagen, Northvolt’s top shareholder with a 21% stake, said it had taken note of the filing and was in close contact with the Swedish firm. It declined to comment on potential repercussions on its own business.STIFF COMPETITIONInvestment group Vargas, a co-founder of Northvolt and one of its largest shareholders, said the bankruptcy would allow the company to address financial challenges and maintain its competitive edge in producing high-performance battery cells.Handelsbanken analyst Hampus Engellau said the bankruptcy filing would give the company some short-term breathing space. Even so, he said, “This tells us that they haven’t found investors and raised the capital needed to restructure their business.”Northvolt had been discussing the possibility of filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States as one of several options for survival, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.Northvolt has led a wave of European startups investing tens of billions of dollars in battery production to serve the continent’s automakers as they switch from internal-combustion engines to EVs.But EV demand is growing at a slower pace than some in the industry had projected, and competition remains stiff from China, which controls 85% of global battery-cell production, according to International Energy Agency data.At a court hearing late Thursday, US Bankruptcy Judge Alfredo Perez approved some routine initial steps in Northvolt’s bankruptcy, including allowing the company to pay wages owed to employees and draw the first $51 million of the Scania loan.On Monday, Reuters reported that Northvolt had missed some in-house targets and curtailed production at its battery-cell plant in Skellefteå, underscoring the challenge of ramping up output.The company’s court filing on Thursday said it had capacity to produce 300,000 batteries a year.In October, Northvolt struck a deal that gave access to a small amount of money while talks on a bigger financing package continued, Business Daily DI reported.Those talks had become more difficult in recent weeks, one of the sources familiar with the Chapter 11 plan said.In recent years several Swedish companies have opted for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filings, such as Scandinavian airline SAS and debt collector Intrum, a process that allows management to retain control over the company and run operations.Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch said on social media platform X that the government continues to support the EV battery industry and hopes that the restructuring will help turn around Northvolt’s fortunes. Busch told Reuters on Tuesday that the Swedish government had no plans to take a stake in Northvolt. \nOn Friday the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas and mainly fair in the rest of the country.One or two places of the hilly region of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki and Karnali Province are likely to experience light rain. The Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast chances of light snowfall at one or two places of the high hilly and mountainous region of the country.Tonight the weather will remain partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki and Karnali Province and mainly fair in the rest of the country.On Thursday, Janakpur experienced a maximum temperature of 32.2°C, while Jumla experienced a minimum temperature of -2.8°C. Kathmandu reported a maximum temperature of 21.3°C, with a minimum of 9°C. \n\nA total of 47 Nepalis deported from Russia and Bulgaria have arrived home. Russia repatriated 29 individuals for not attending regular university classes and working without permits, while Bulgaria sent back 18 Nepalis who were victims of human trafficking, officials said.Russian authorities arrested 34 Nepalis on October 30 from a call centre in Moscow’s Kuzminki area. The following day, a local court approved their deportation. Twenty-nine of them were sent to Nepal on Monday night via an Air Arabia flight and arrived in Kathmandu on Tuesday evening. The remaining five are still undergoing deportation processes.Many of the deported students said education consultancies had misled them about opportunities in Russia. One student said, “We were told we could study and work without restrictions, but that was untrue. Living in Russia without work was impossible, and we were arrested while working.” Before deportation, they were held at a detention centre in Sakharovo, 60 km from Moscow.Most of them had gone to Russia two years ago.An immigration officer at the Tribhuvan International Airport said they didn’t investigate further. “We did not find it necessary to take them into custody for further statements,” said an immigration officer. “All of them were released through standard procedures.”The returning students said they would discuss whether to file complaints against the education consultancies. “We are all under mental stress right now,” one student said. “We will discuss what steps to take to prevent other students from being exploited like us.”Keshav Timilsina, president of the Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) Russia, said the lack of proper documentation prevented them from receiving legal support.“If dissatisfied with the court’s decision, an appeal can be filed,” he said. “Relatives and friends of the detained students had contacted the NRNA for assistance. We were prepared to hire a lawyer to pursue legal remedies, but they could not provide documents such as contracts with the employer or proof of university attendance. Without these papers, the plan to appeal was cancelled.”Sushil Ghimire, Nepal’s acting ambassador to Russia, said the embassy could not assist as the students had violated local laws. “Russian law mandates attendance for students, but most were working instead. Violating labour laws left us with no legal grounds to support them,” he said.Timilsina said that most students who travelled to Russia through consultancies, except those on government scholarships, have faced such issues. “Russia provides scholarships to 200 Nepali students annually, and those receiving scholarships do not incur any expenses,” he said. “Russia is a destination for studying only through government educational scholarships. It is impossible to work while studying, as some consultancies claim.”Meanwhile, Bulgaria deported 18 Nepalis who were trafficked via India, Romania, and Hungary. They lacked proper entry documents and were detained for three months in a deportation centre in Sofia. The Nepalis were sent back to Nepal on government-sponsored tickets, arriving in Kathmandu last Thursday.The Nepali embassy in Germany, which oversees consular services for Bulgaria, said the deported individuals had been arrested for lacking official documents. \nAt least 38 people were killed in a gun attack carried out on passenger vans in the lower Kurram area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Thursday, according to the police.Ahmady Shama Station House Officer Kaleem Shah told Dawn.com that 38 people were killed, including three women, and 11 were injured.Earlier, Tehsil Head Quarters (THQ) Hospital Alizai Medical Superintendent Dr Muhammad Ishaq said 33 people were killed and 30 injured, adding that the latter were being referred to various hospitals in the district and some to Peshawar.KP Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry told Reuters that “the death toll is likely to rise”.President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the incident and expressed his condolences to the bereaved of the deceased.“Attacking innocent passengers is a cowardly and inhumane act,” he was quoted as saying in a post on X by PPP’s media cell.He added that those responsible for the incident should be punished. He urged that timely medical aid be provided to the injured.KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur took strict notice of the incident and also condemned it.He directed a delegation comprising the chief secretary, provincial law minister and the area’s MNA and MPA to visit Kurram immediately.The incident comes amid a sharp uptick in the number of terrorist attacks in Balochistan and KP.Attacks escalated after the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan outfit broke a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022 and vowed to target security forces.Last month, two terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation in KP’s North Waziristan district.Twelve security personnel were martyred after a checkpost was targeted in the Mali Khel area of KP’s Bannu, the military’s media affairs wing said a day ago.- In association with Asia News Network \nNepal has received a sovereign credit rating of ‘BB Minus’ from the international agency Fitch Ratings. While this rating places Nepal one level below India, it remains higher than that of other South Asian nations.The rating reflects Nepal’s strong foreign currency reserves and indications of revitalised economic activity, which are expected to contribute to positive economic growth in the country.Fitch Ratings conducted an on-site assessment in September before releasing its findings. While not an exceptional rating, experts highlight that it is neither poor. Generally, countries rated above ‘BB Minus’ are considered favourable for investment. Ratings below this fall under the speculative grade, with lower tiers indicating higher risks or potential insolvency. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel has conferred the honorary rank of General of the Nepali Army on General Upendra Dwivedi, chief of the army staff (COAS) of India.He was presented a sword and a scroll at a special ceremony organised at the Office of President Sheetal Niwas on Thursday. Vice President Ramsahay Prasad Yadav, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Defence Minister Manbir Rai, among other top officials attended the function, according to the Office of the President.Nepal and India have given continuity to the tradition of conferring army chiefs of each other’s country with the honorary title for the past over seven decades.General Dwivedi, who arrived in Kathmandu on Wednesday on a five-day official visit, will hold other meetings, besides receiving the honorary rank. The five-member delegation, led by him, also includes Sunita Dwivedi, chair of the Army Wives Welfare Association of the Indian Army. According to the Ministry of Defence of India, Dwivedi is scheduled to address the student officers of Nepali Army Command and Staff Course, Shivapuri on Friday. During the day, General Dwivedi will call on Prime Minister Oli and Defence Minister Manbir Rai and engage in talks on issues of mutual interests, the ministry said in a press release issued on Wednesday.On Saturday, Dwivedi will attend an ex-servicemen’s rally at Pokhara, wherein the COAS will felicitate Veer Naris and Gallantry Awardees and he will also interact with the Indian Army veterans. “The COAS will visit Western Division HQ, Nepali Army and will be briefed in presence of General Officer Commanding, Western Division, Nepali Army,” it said.Ahead of his visit, Amrit Mohan Prasad, director general of India’s Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), visited Nepal to attend the eighth annual coordination meeting between SSB and Nepal’s Armed Police Force. During the two-day meeting that concluded on Monday, the two sides expressed concerns over the movement of third-country nationals through the Nepal-India border. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nThomas Bell is a man of few words. When we decided to meet at Cafe Cheeno in Patandhoka following the launch of his book, ‘Human Nature’, I expected our conversation to last for an hour, but we were done within twenty minutes. Bell studied at the University of Oxford and the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. Fresh from graduation, he came to Kathmandu for the first time in 2002 as an international correspondent to cover the ongoing civil war. He ended up staying longer than he would have imagined—eighteen years. His books, ‘Kathmandu’ (2014) and ‘Human Nature’ (2024), result from his in-depth reporting, travels and research on Nepal and the Nepali people.Currently living in the UK, Bell, a former South East Asia correspondent for the UK Daily Telegraph, is more inclined towards books than journalism. In this chat with the Post’s Anish Ghimire, Bell discusses coming to Nepal, the state of contemporary journalism and his new book ‘Human Nature’.Have you always wanted to be a journalist? Not exactly. After I finished university, I began looking around, thinking about what I should do, and journalism seemed like it would combine a few things I was interested in: politics, travel, and writing. So it was a choice I made later.What made you come to Nepal during a difficult period and write ‘Kathmandu’?Well, I came here because it was a difficult period. I had recently graduated in history and wanted to be a foreign correspondent. So, I looked around, considered a few options, and chose Nepal. It felt like the right option because of what was happening in the country. Right after the royal massacre, the Maoists were making progress in the countryside, and the world was paying attention to Nepal. It seemed like a nice place to travel around as well. The country grew on me, and I ended up staying for about eighteen years.How did your time in Nepal shape your understanding of the complex relationship between the country’s history, culture and politics? I was primed to think about those relationships because of what I studied at the university. Alongside a degree in history, I also acquired another degree in architectural history. So, writing about it came naturally. Plus, I was interested in learning about the country’s culture, politics, and architecture. I dug deeper to write about how the streets, the squares, the chowks, and the buildings worked together.I have done something similar with the new book, ‘Human Nature’, but instead of built-in environments, it’s about the hills, mountains, forests, and rivers. You’ve been in journalism for a long time, having worked for the Economist and The Daily Telegraph. How has journalism changed since you arrived in Nepal for the first time? Journalism around the world has changed a lot. Today, there is a lot less money in it. When I started, Nepal was going through a difficult period, and there were plenty of stories to report. A young man like me could make a decent living abroad because newspapers paid my freelance work a modest amount.However, that is not the case anymore because of industry changes and the emergence of the internet. The media worldwide lacks resources, and people get their news by other means. Another big difference is when I first came here, a few Nepali journalists reported in English for foreign media. Now, that space is filled up by many local reporters who can do much better than an outsider. So, that’s good progress.Some of the changes in the industry brought about by the internet have also affected the domestic media landscape here. Newspapers are struggling for business. For the last few days, I have been trying to find newspapers in the market; there weren’t many shops selling them.Your new book, ‘Human Nature’, explores Nepal’s history. What aspect of the country do you believe is most misunderstood?This book looks at Nepal’s history but from a particular lens—in terms of the relationships between society, culture, and the environment. So, it’s kind of an environmental history. Something that might be new to the readers is the discussion of the role of agriculture.Prithvi Narayan Shah is celebrated as a military and political genius who rose from the micro-kingdom of Gorkha to unify Nepal. By his death in 1775, he had conquered the Kathmandu Valley and established it as his capital. He laid the foundation for the Gorkhali Empire, which briefly spanned the Himalayas from Sikkim to Punjab. His success is often attributed to his strategic brilliance and patriotic vision, portraying him as a unifier of a fragmented land. A key aspect of his strategy was rewarding soldiers with land, creating a land-military system that fueled his empire’s expansion. However, this narrative is intertwined with a more profound history: the rise of agriculture, particularly rice farming. Rice cultivation had been spreading eastward in Nepal long before King Shah’s time, fostering the growth of small kingdoms. Unlike foraging or pastoralism, rice farming produced surplus food, which brought about taxation and the establishment of villages, kings, laws, and temples. This agricultural transformation necessitated greater social and military organisation, creating the conditions for unification. King Shah and his successors finalised this process, consolidating the numerous ‘rice kingdoms’ into a single nation, completing a centuries-long evolution of agrarian society into a centralised state.How similar or different is writing a piece and writing a book?I don’t do much journalism these days. The only writing I do is for my books, which come out occasionally. But yeah, the writing process is very different. Writing a short piece is merely a thousand words, whereas a book is about eighty thousand words. The difference is like running a marathon and a sprint, I guess.

The committee was established following the issuance of the special structures operation and management development committee (formation order), published in the Nepal Gazette on November 18.The listed structures include the International Convention Centre in New Baneshwar, Kathmandu, which currently houses the Federal Parliament; the Sunrise Hall in Godavari, Lalitpur; the Butwal International Convention and Exhibition Centre in Rupandehi; the Dharahara in Kathmandu; and the Damak View Tower in Jhapa.The committee will oversee the operation of these facilities, including Dharahara, despite prior recommendations suggesting its management be handed over to local government for long-term operation.Earlier, a study team led by Senior Divisional Engineer Lila Khatri from the Urban Development and Building Construction Department submitted a report on August 18 recommending Dharahara’s operation under Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). However, the federal government opted to retain control under the Urban Development Ministry, potentially triggering tensions between the KMC and the central government.The newly issued order also dissolved the International Convention Centre Development Committee, which was in operation since 1994. According to the directive, management of the facilities will now fall under an executive director appointed through open competition.The Development Committee’s central office will be located in Kathmandu, with provisions to establish branch offices near other listed structures as necessary.While the Damak View Tower, strongly promoted by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, remains incomplete and non-operational, the government has listed it among the special structures.Dharahara, previously managed by the KMC since 1998, was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake and rebuilt under the National Reconstruction Authority. \nCandidates for mayor in Kirtipur Municipality, where a by-election is being held on December 1, have started their election campaign. In the race are a total of 20 candidates—nine from various political parties and 11 independents.In the 2022 local elections, independent candidates presented a formidable challenge to political party candidates in various local units. Independent candidates won mayorships in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, the Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City and the Dhangadhi Municipality. Will the outcome in Kirtipur be different this time, or will the traditional parties prevail? The by-election comes after the death of Rajkumar Nakarmi, former Mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, who died in July due to kidney failure. He had won on a Nepali Congress ticket.Major political parties including the Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have fielded their candidates. But the fourth largest political party in the House of Representatives, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, did not field anyone reportedly after failing to find a suitable candidate.The candidates include Krishnaman Dangol from the Congress, Surendra Manandhar from the UML, and Shiva Sharan Maharjan from the Maoist Centre. Besides these, seventeen others, including 11 independents, have filed their nominations. Candidates from other parties include Dil Kumar Maharjan of the Nepal Samajbawadi Party, Shri Krishna Maharjan of the Nepal Majdoor Kishan Party, Dhurba Maharjan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, and Keshav Shrestha of the Janamat Party. Similarly, independent candidates include Navaraj Kumar Baniya, Rajman Manav, Ram Krishna Maharjan, Mim Maharjan, Prem Bahadur Maharjan, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari, Naresh Shrestha, Dharmaratna Manandhar, Ananda Maharjan, Nareshraj Pande, and Kabir Kumar Maharjan. In the 2022 local elections, the Congress candidate Nakarmi won the mayorship with 9,043 votes, while his closest competitor, Keshav Ratna Bajracharya of the UML, secured 5,507 votes. The Maoist Centre’s Shiva Saran Maharjan, who is contesting for the position in the by-election, had obtained 4,090 votes then. Of the total 31,112 registered voters, almost 14,000 live in the core area of Kirtipur, and the remaining 17,000 reside in the peripheral regions. The core area includes the municipality’s wards 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, including Tyanglaphat, whereas the peripheral areas include wards 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The core area is predominantly inhabited by the Newar community, while the peripheral region is more diverse with migrants in big numbers. Political leaders and analysts say that the peripheral region will be decisive in the election.But Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol disputes this claiming that the concept of peripheral region is a misrepresentation. “The area that some people call ‘peripheral’ is in fact the core of Kirtipur,” Dangol told the Post. “From Nagau, Panga, Bhajungle, to Chobhar all are part of Kirtipur’s core area.”UML candidate Surendra Manandhar agrees with Dangol and says dividing the local unit along community lines is not a good idea.Dangol, the Congress candidate, considers UML’s Manandhar his close competitor, but some local residents say the true challenge could come from the Maoist Centre’s Shiva Sharan Maharjan, who had a strong showing in the 2022 local election. “Majarjan already contested and did well. The UML’s Manandhar is new, therefore we believe there will be a tough competition between the Congress and the Maoist Centre,” said a local resident.The Maoist Centre has also forged an electoral alliance with the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Janata Samajbadi-Nepal, led by Upendra Yadav, to strengthen its bid.“I lost the previous election due to a technical mistake, but this time, we are confident of a win,” the Maoist Centre candidate Maharjan told the Post. He said his chances have improved due to the growing public disenchantment towards the current ruling Congress-UML coalition.But UML’s Manandhar appears unbothered by the competition. He said he is better prepared than others and is confident of a win.For the Congress, the contest appears more difficult as former Congress party members are running as independents. Kabir Kumar Maharjan and Dinesh Kumar Adhikari, who were previously with the Congress, are among the independent candidates.“The situation of Congress is different. For other parties, winning adds a seat, but losing doesn’t make much difference because they hadn’t won this seat in the previous election,” Himal Karki, a local Congress leader, told the Post. “But, for Congress, there’s a pressure to win because this is a seat our party earlier won.”An overwhelming presence of independent candidates makes the contest more complex for Congress, as local figures who have established their own identity in Kirtipur, such as Rajman Manav, are getting considerable voter attention.Harka Sampang, the independent mayor of Dharan Sub-metropolitan City, has also expressed his support for Manav. Sampang is set to join Manav’s election campaign starting from November 23.“Harka Sampang will be in Kirtipur for my election campaign,” Manav told the Post.Congress candidate Dangol, meanwhile, does not consider Manav as a competitor. He claimed that Manav is a former UML cadre and quit the party to focus on social activities, especially sanitation campaigns. “So Manav could draw UML votes, not ours,” Dangol said.Meanwhile, Suresh Maharjan, a Kirtipur resident who identifies himself as a Maoist Centre sympathiser, says the votes garnered by independent candidates will determine the election’s outcome.  \nPolice in Kathmandu have now started investigation against Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, former deputy inspector general (DIG) of Nepal Police Chhabi Lal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel on the charge of diverting funds from cooperatives to Gorkha Media Network when they were holding key positions in the media company.The Kathmandu District Court on Sunday permitted the police to arrest former home minister Lamichhane and former DIG Joshi to investigate the charges of misusing deposits of Swarnalakshmi Savings Cooperative in Kalimati, Kathmandu. Earlier, the court had also authorised the arrest of 24 others, including Gorkha Media chair Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, in relation to the same case.Lamichhane, Joshi and Ramtel have already been arrested and are being interrogated in Kaski and Rupandehi districts over the misuse of cooperative funds. With this, the police are now simultaneously investigating them in the three districts of Kathmandu, Kaski and Rupandehi.The trio is accused of diverting tens of millions of rupees from Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperative and Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative to Gorkha Media Network that operated the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television. Rai and Lamichhane were chairman and managing director of the media company respectively. Joshi and Ramtel were also board members.Lamichhane quit media to join politics in June, 2022.Ramtel, implicated in the Swarnalaxmi Cooperative fraud case, was brought from Pokhara to Kathmandu for further interrogation on November 16. After completing Ramtel’s interrogation, police now plan to bring Lamichhane and Joshi, who are in police custody in Pokhara, to Kathmandu. A police officer said they will be brought to Kathmandu to be interrogated over the misappropriation of money from Swarnalaxmi Cooperative. Lamichhane, Joshi and Ramtel were also taken to Rupandehi for interrogation and brought back to Kaski last week.Ramtel, the treasurer of Surya Darshan Cooperative in Pokhara, was arrested on September 11 and held in Pokhara before he was brought to Kathmandu in a separate cooperative fraud investigation. A police officer privy to the development said that after Ramtel’s interrogation in Kathmandu, he was sent to Pokhara on Sunday night. However, Nawaraj Adhikari, the spokesperson of the Kathmandu Police Range, refused to divulge when Lamichhane and Joshi will also be brought to Kathmandu from Pokhara. He also declined to give more details on Ramtel’s interrogation. The Swarnalaxmi Cooperative fraud case began with complaints filed at the Kalimati Police Circle and involved 24 suspects, including the cooperative’s chairman GB Rai, and Ramtel, the treasurer. Police estimate a misappropriation of Rs1.11 billion, affecting 645 depositors.While the trio is under police remand, Rai is on the run. Despite a Interpol red notice against him, his whereabouts are still unknown. Based on the complaint filed by the victim to the Kathmandu Metropolitan City and the police, along with the report of the Parliamentary Special Investigation Committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives, the police were granted permission by the court to arrest 24 people accused in the case in the Swarnalaxmi Cooperative fraud case. The Gorkha Media Network leadership reportedly misappropriated funds of Swarnalaxmi, Suryadarshan, Supreme and some other cooperatives across the country. Joshi was arrested from Kathmandu on September 22 and Lamichhane on October 18 and both were taken to Pokhara. Earlier in September, the parliamentary special probe, in its report submitted to Speaker Devraj Ghimire, recommended prosecuting four individuals, including Lamichhane, the then managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Rai; board member Ramtel; and initial founder Joshi. Following Lamichhane’s arrest, the RSP has been staging street protests since October 19, saying the arrest is politically motivated. \nDaman Nath Dhungana, the first Speaker after the restoration of democracy in 1990, and a human rights defender who always stood for justice for anti-establishment forces passed away on Sunday. He was 83.Dhungana, who was suffering from a chronic liver problem, was rushed to the Baneshwar-based Frontline Hospital after he experienced breathing problems on Sunday. Doctors pronounced him dead upon arrival at the hospital.Dhungana was born in January 1942 in Kathmandu.Throughout his life, Dhungana maintained a distinct identity in Nepal’s political movements. Despite being affiliated to the Nepali Congress for a long time, he didn’t confine himself within the party’s domain. He earned immense respect from other political parties and communities fighting for their rights and identity.He joined politics as a student activist from the beginning of the Panchayat period in the 1960s and later established himself as an advocate, human rights activist, civil society leader, and politician. He became general secretary of the Nepal Bar Association in 1971. Dhungana was also a founder executive member of Amnesty International. In 1990 he served as a member of the Constitution Recommendation Commission that drafted Nepal’s constitution.Dhungana spent five years in jail during different periods under the Panchayat regime for supporting political parties that were banned at the time for opposing the system. He fought against the Panchayat system and for the restoration of democracy after King Mahendra abolished the parliamentary system and imposed the partyless Panchayat system in 1960, says Congress leader Arjun Narashinga KC.“Dhungana was an intellectually towering figure who made a huge contribution to Nepali society,” former minister KC said.Those who remember Dhungana say that his legacy cannot be captured through a single lens since he had multiple identities.Raghuji Pant of the CPN-UML remembers Dhungana as a lawyer who advocated for democratic rights during the Panchayat regime. Later, Dhungana got elected as a member of parliament from Kathmandu-2 on a ticket of the Nepali Congress, which also won a majority in the 205-seat House of Representatives during the 1992 parliamentary polls, the first general election conducted after the restoration of democracy in 1990. As the only Congress candidate to be elected from Kathmandu and his background as an advocate and former general secretary of Nepal Bar Association made him an ideal choice for the role of Speaker. Dhungana thus became the first Speaker after the restoration of the democracy, and the second in overall parliamentary history of Nepal. Congress leader Krishna Parsad Bhattarai is the first Speaker in Nepal’s history as he was Speaker of the first parliament elected in 1959.“However, Dhungana was someone who set a benchmark for Speakers in Nepal and someone who could be consulted on Parliamentary affairs,” lawmaker Pant told the Post. “Despite being from the rival political party, we alway respected him.”For Pant, a phrase coined by Dhungana in the parliamentary history of Nepal is something to be cherished which is, “Parliament always belongs to the opposition party while the government is led by the ruling party.”Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who closely followed parliamentary affairs, believed that Dhungana’s approach to give the opposition party more space in the House made him a leader respected by all.Thapa also says that there was a time when the Congress, the party that appointed him as Speaker, was unhappy with him for giving more space to the opposition.Dhungana could not complete his term as Speaker after Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala dissolved the House and announced midterm elections in 1994 due to intra-party feud within the Congress party.Dhungana wasn’t quite active as a party leader after the mid-term election of 1994. However, he played a key role as a civil society leader in the people’s movement in 2006. Dhungana also played an active role in facilitating negotiations between the government agencies and mainstream political parties with the erstwhile rebel Maoists. He was one of the key mediators while signing important agreements between mainstream political forces and Maoists. In 2017, after a 23-year gap from active party politics, Dhungana contested the parliamentary election from Bhaktapur-2 on a Congress ticket, but did not win.In an interview with The Kathmandu Post in August last year, Dhungana had said that Nepalis brought about radical political changes but didn’t learn how to run the democracy responsibly. “As successive governments have failed to deliver, those who want to undo recent political changes are emboldened,” he said in the interview. “A section of the intelligentsia also backs the idea. This is how multiple complications are emerging.”Dhungana is survived by his wife Bhuwan Koirala, two sons, and a daughter. According to family sources, he will be cremated on Monday after one of the sons Nimesh Dhungana who is in Britain returns. His other son Nishesh and daughter Nikita are in Nepal.Tributes pour inTop politicians, members of the intelligentsia and rights activists, among others, have paid tributes to Dhungana and expressed condolences to the bereaved family members.President Ramchandra Paudel said he was shocked by the news of Dhungana’s death. “The contribution made by Dhungana to the democratic movement as a politician, senior advocate and a civil society leader will always be remembered,” the Office of the President wrote on social media platform X on Sunday.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli expressed his sadness and wrote on Facebook: “I recall his remarkable contribution to the human rights movement and promotion of parliamentary democracy in Nepal.”Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel said “Dhungana’s death caused irreparable loss to the country’s democratic movement.”Akhilesh Upadhyay, former editor-in-chief of The Kathmandu Post, remembers Dhungana as arguably Nepal's best Speaker to date.“Much respected by the opposition- UML, NWPP, Sadhavana, etc. But Nepali Congress heavyweight and then-prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala disliked him; Dhungana refused to entertain GPK's partisan interests,” Upadhyay wrote on X. “History will be kinder. RIP.” \nA total of 410 candidates have registered their nominations for 44 positions in Nepal’s upcoming local by-elections, scheduled for December 1, according to the Election Commission.Of the nominees, 342 are men, 66 women, and two belong to other categories. Notably, two women are competing for the role of chief of the Kailali District Coordination Committee, while Nepali Congress candidate Tek Raj Bhattarai is the sole nominee for the same position in Okhaldhunga district.For the eight posts of rural municipality chairperson and deputy chairperson, as well as municipality mayor and deputy mayor, 84 candidates have filed nominations, including 35 women and 48 men.Similarly, for the 34 vacant ward chair positions in municipalities and rural municipalities, 323 candidates have been nominated–29 women, 293 men, and one other candidate, stated Election Commission Spokesperson Nita Pokharel Aryal.The by-elections will see participation from 25 political parties, including the fourth-largest party in the parliament, Rastriya Swatantra Party, which emerged after the 2022 local elections. Citizens will elect representatives for two district coordination committee chiefs, two rural municipality chairpersons, four vice-chairs, one mayor, one deputy mayor, and 34 ward chairpersons. The vacancies arise as these positions, originally filled during the 2022 elections, have not yet completed their full terms.The Election Commission has enforced a code of conduct starting from the nomination day. This includes prohibitions on symbolic materials such as jackets, caps, and stickers bearing party symbols, and restrictions on election rallies to ensure a disciplined and civilised process. Political parties have been urged to adhere to these rules, with campaigns restricted to official online platforms for sharing their principles and commitments.The commission has also imposed spending limits for candidates. Mayoral and deputy mayoral candidates can spend up to Rs450,000, rural municipality chairs and vice-chairs up to Rs350,000, and ward chair aspirants for rural municipalities up to Rs150,000. In a notable decision, only women candidates are allowed for the four vacant vice-chair positions, aiming to promote gender inclusivity.The final list of candidates and their poll symbols will be published after any objections and withdrawals are resolved. As the by-elections approach, the spotlight remains on how political parties and candidates navigate these regulations while engaging with voters. \nOne person was killed and five others injured in a tractor accident in Bhaktapur on Saturday.The incident occurred when the tractor lost control and overturned while travelling to Dekochha from Changunarayan.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Dhundiraj Neupane of the District Police Office, Bhaktapur, 45-year-old Hari Govinda Suwal from Changunarayan Municipality-5 succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital. Four others—35-year-old Radhika Awal, 60-year-old Gopal Koju, 44-year-old Radheshyam Sitikhu, and 74-year-old Purnakesi Shilpakar—suffered minor injuries and were discharged after receiving treatment at the hospital.The 48-year-old driver, Ganesh Suwal, from Bhaktapur Municipality-2, is currently undergoing treatment at the hospital. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nTen people were injured in a bus accident at Ghumaune in Kharipati of Bhaktapur district on Tuesday. Two are reportedly in critical condition.According to Pradeep Khatri, a traffic police inspector and chief of the District Traffic Police Range, the bus coming from Talakot of Changunarayan Municipality lost its control and hit a pole. The injured are undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital, police said. \nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nWhen Tanahun’s headquarters shifted to Damauli from Bandipur in November 1968, hordes of traders from Bandipur left for key cities like Chitwan, Damauli, Kathmandu, and Pokhara. The identity of Bandipur was at risk when the traders, along with the district headquarters, shifted.However, Bandipur has changed its identity due to the role of locals in cultural heritage conservation through community participation.Bikram Piya, a 55-year-old local, said that after the construction of the Prithvi Highway, if the headquarters had remained in Bandipur, people residing in the western part of Tanahun would be greatly inconvenienced in accessing government services.  “Therefore, Damauli is perfect for the district headquarters from the accessibility point of view.”Bandipur's history, a hilltop settlement 143 km west of Kathmandu and 80 km east of Pokhara, began in the 19th century when Newars from Bhaktapur arrived.Before that, it was inhabited mainly by Magars. After Prithvi Narayan Shah conquered Kathmandu Valley, the Newar merchants chose Bandipur as a trade route between India and Tibet. The merchants built their houses so as to reflect their style, architecture, and culture. Thus, the houses consist of pagoda-style roofs, lattice windows, and ornate doorways.Today, it is one of the most famous tourist destinations of Nepal. “The living culture, structure and natural beauty are the defining features of Bandipur,” said Piya.The Magars used to live in Bandipur and gave the place its name. In the Magar language, ‘Ban’ means forest, ‘Di’ means water, and ‘Pur’ means place. Civilisations have relied on forests and water since ancient times.According to old local documents, first Piya, then Pradhan, Shrestha, and Joshi settled here, and then other Newar types came.Bikram, a ninth-generation settler, says: “Bandipur is a living museum of Newari art and culture.”“Bandipur sits in the best of nature. It is also an appropriate place for business. That’s why it became a big draw for Newars from Bhaktapur,” said Chij Kumar Shrestha, an 80-year-old local. “Ancestors settled where there was water, land and jungle. Mine did the same too.”Trade was the major occupation of Newars. They supplied salt, edible oil, and other goods from Thori, Chitwan, on the Nepal-India border, and sold them in Bandipur Bazaar.Shrestha said that Bandipur developed as a trading point between the south and north. Goods imported from India used to be supplied to the hills and mountain areas like Tanahun, Kaski, Lamjung, and Gorkha, and goods brought from the hills and mountains would be supplied to the south from Bandipur.As highway expansion took place and traders started shifting to Chitwan, Kathmandu, Damauli, Pokhara, and Dumre, business activities in Bandipur started to slow down.“As young people moved away, the villages were left with old people. Even if tourists, by any chance, were found in Bandipur, they called it a ghost town,” said Sujan Shrestha, a 50-year-old local.Moved by the situation, people from Bandipur living in Kathmandu formed the Bandipur Social Development Committee in 1992. The committee's president, Sujan Shrestha, said the objective was to unite the people of Bandipur in tourism, education, and health.Sujan said Bandipur was promoted internationally because it represents different ethnicities' natural and cultural richness.“Foreign tourists started arriving, and homestays started to open,” said Sujan. “Training sessions on hospitability were provided on services ranging from tea brewing to homestay operations.” All types of vehicles started operating in Bandipur Bazaar in 1999. However, they were restricted due to the paving of market areas with stones.Bandipur is a destination preferred by those who want to escape crowds and pollution. A pleasant mountain range can be observed from the high hill of Bandipur, including the view of the rising and setting sun. A wide view of mountains is another feature of Bandipur.An open area stretches 3 km on the horizon, and hills can be observed from Tundikhel, a 10 minute walk from Bandipur.From top to bottom, mountain ranges like Langtang, Ganesh, Gorkha (Manaslu, Himchuli, and Boudha), Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchchhre, and Kanjirowa can be observed.A natural view tower, the land area near Marsyangdi River can also be observed from Bandipur.Developed as one of the outstanding tourism destinations of Gandaki province, Bandipur is also known as the ‘Queen of Hills.’ Located at a height of 1,317 metres, Bandipur is popular for its perfect view of mountain ranges and its cultural and religious significance. “Agro-eco tourism and adventure tourism is the big draw of Bandipur,” said Kishan Pradhan, president of the Bandipur Tourism Development Committee.Tourism activity, which has slowed down due to the devastating earthquake of 2015 and the Covid-19 pandemic, is gradually reviving.“The presence of domestic and international visitors is now good,” said Pradhan.Bipin Pradhan, a hotelier, said traditional art and culture, natural views, and a clean environment are the reasons why domestic and foreign tourists come.Siddha Cave in Bandipur, a rural municipality, is claimed to be Asia’s largest.Basanta Poudel, secretary of Bandipur Tourism Development Committee, said Bandipur is also an appropriate place for hiking.“Bhanjyang and resting area located at the height of 1,150 metres from sea level, paragliding from Gurungche Hill attracts tourists,” said Basanta.Around 90 big and small hotels and restaurants are operating in Bandipur, while four community homestays in the market area and 11 in the rural municipality are in operation.The hotel and homestay services in Bandipur can cater to 5,000 people.To increase tourists' stay, a mini great wall was constructed in 2019. The 6-km wall is being constructed from Thanimai temple to Mukundeshwari hill.The construction of the mini-great wall is expected to cost around Rs20 million.“The construction of structures like this can attract tourists,” said Surendra Bahadur Thapa, chairman of the rural municipality.Construction of projects like Thanimai temple, selfie garden, paragliding area, horse riding arena, Pushpalal memorial garden, Mukundeshwari garden, and a glass bridge is moving ahead. \nThe state-owned Dairy Development Corporation (DDC) and private dairies have been able to settle only half of the dues in the past one year as dairy demand remained subdued even during the festival season.Both private and state-run dairies were optimistic that the festivals in October and November would push up sales.Surya Prasad Paudel, general manager of the DDC, said there has been no improvement in sales even during festivals, which ended recently. “We gave festive sales targets to super markets like Bhatbhateni and Big Mart but those targets were not met.”Dairy farmers say out of an estimated Rs6 billion due to be paid by dairies, they are yet to receive Rs3 billion. “We had Rs1.58 billions in arrears to be paid to dairy farmers as of July. In the past four months, we cleared Rs1 billion in dues,” said Paudel. “We will gradually settle the remaining dues.”“We are focusing on product marketisation so that we can clear the remaining dues,” he said, adding that the DDC is planning to outsource private company to market and sell the stocks piling up.As sales did not improve, on September 27, the Public Debt Management Office loaned Rs600 million to the DDC.DDC exported 1,000 kilos of ghee to Japan last month. “We are expecting a monthly export of 5,000 kilos of ghee to Japan and making necessary preparations for that,” said Paudel.“A company has approached us to buy dairy products made from 10,000 litres of milk. We are in the agreement phase and discussing specifically on pricing.”Paudel did not reveal more but said the company exports goods to the US and other markets.DDC is planning to reduce the price of ghee targeting the consumer segment. “The decision on reviewing the price on ghee will be taken on Tuesday or Wednesday,” said Paudel.DDC buys milk worth around Rs200 million from farmers monthly.According to the corporation, it has 400 tonnes of skimmed powder milk and 400 tonnes of butter in stock.Since the corporation has to pay back the loan and clear the dues to dairy farmers and different parties, Paudel said it will take some measures to cut unnecessary expenditures.A committee was formed to recommend reforms and cost-cutting measures. “We have received the report and we are planning to implement it.”Private dairies claim to have settled all outstanding dues of the farmers.“We have cleared all the dues of farmers by taking loans from the bank. The festive demand increased the consumption of dairy products which also helped in clearing arrears of farmers,” said Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association.Earlier, the private dairies asked the government for loans by putting butter and powder milk stocks as collateral, but the government did not respond.The association had said that the private dairies had around Rs2 billion dues to be paid to the farmers a month and a half ago.According to the association, the private sector has 2,000 tonnes of unsold butter in stock. The sale of dairy products improved in the festive season sales but the off-season of dairy products has started, the private dairy entrepreneurs said.“We normally convert liquid milk into powder milk during March-April when the sales decline,” said Dahal.The association said that 3.2 million litres of milk arrives in the market daily, of which around 25 percent is held by the DDC and the remaining is purchased by private dairies.The daily milk purchases of the private dairies amount to around Rs100 million.“Out of the around Rs6 billion in arrears, both the government-owned DDC and private dairies have cleared around Rs3 billion till now,” said Amar Bahadur Kunwar, president of the Central Dairy Cooperative Association. The DDC has sent the dues amount to dairy farmers’ accounts. As the sales will decline from December to February, dairy farmers might not get their payment on time again.The output of dairy products like curd and ice cream declines in winter, increasing the stock of milk, which adds to the arrears, said Kunwar. The total arrears, including the old, may reach Rs5 billion in these three months, said Kunwar.Both state-owned and private dairies say that the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened the dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for nearly a year.Most of the farmers in eastern Tarai faced even more hardships as it has been nearly a year since they received any payments. \nAntimicrobial resistance is a common problem for most patients requiring intensive care in hospitals. What alarms doctors and experts is that the problem is not limited to patients with serious ailments but it also affects those seeking outpatient care.The irrational use of antimicrobials in humans, animals, and plants has led to a ‘silent pandemic’, and many people, including policymakers, have not taken the issue seriously.“Misuse, random use, and irrational use of antimicrobials, which can be purchased over-the-counter, has been leading to a serious crisis in our country,” said Dr Raju Pangeni, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Hams Hospital. “Most patients arrive at the hospital after using higher-grade antibiotics.”Experts warn that antimicrobials, which have saved millions of lives throughout the world, could soon become ineffective due to the high resistance rate caused by their irrational use.The World Health Organisation said antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites evolve over time and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death. As a result, medicines become ineffective and infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of their spread to others.Antibiotics, despite being prescription drugs, can be easily purchased over the counter in Nepal. Many people buy them without explaining their exact problems to pharmacists. And in many cases, pharmacists do not bother to inquire and fail to emphasise the importance of completing the prescribed course of medicine, which is among the main reasons for the growing rate of antimicrobial resistance, according to experts.Moreover, doctors usually prescribe antibiotics based on clinical diagnoses, even before receiving laboratory test reports. Experts say antibiotics do not work if the underlying infection is caused by a virus. According to experts, a patient’s sensitivity to antibiotics must be known before prescribing them, but very few doctors take the time to understand their patients' sensitivity to the drugs they prescribe. Patients are also unaware that the course of antibiotics must be completed and stopping them halfway could render the same antibiotic ineffective in the future. According to a 2021 study of the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC), only 32 percent of the doctors and health workers have access to laboratories for antibiotic susceptibility testing. Among them, only 49 percent recommend antibiotic susceptibility testing before prescribing antibiotics. This means that only 16 percent of doctors recommend antibiotics after conducting susceptibility testing.“There is a significant reason influencing rational prescriptions of antibiotics,” the report stated. The study also shows that more than one-third—37.8 percent—of prescribed medicines were antibiotics, which is higher than the World Health Organisation’s standards.The study shows about one-fourth (22 percent) of the outpatients did not consume a full course of antibiotics. Similarly, about 10 percent of outpatients consume antibiotics as prophylaxis while eight percent take double-dose antibiotics for a quick recovery. Around 22 percent of them save leftover antibiotics for the treatment of similar symptoms in the future. Additionally, around 28 percent of outpatients said they buy antibiotics without doctors’ or health workers’ prescriptions. While human antibiotic use contributes to antibiotic resistance, the widespread use of antibiotics in agricultural applications—most notably livestock and poultry production—is also a potential driver. Doctors say agricultural antibiotics contribute to the presence of resistant bacteria in meat and poultry products. Also, resistant organisms are released from farms into soil, groundwater, and surface waterways, leading to contamination of water sources used for crop irrigation and domestic purposes.The NHRC study showed around 70 percent of farmers used progressively higher doses of antibiotics and more frequently for faster recovery of sick animals or fowls. The study identified major shortcomings in the awareness and availability of national guidelines for prescribing antibiotics and infrastructures for recommending antibiotic susceptibility tests among human and animal health professionals. In a study of human, animal, and environmental samples carried out in the past, antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in 81 percent of the total samples on which antimicrobial resistance tests were carried out. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population says it requires an additional Rs400 million to continue the ‘safe motherhood programme’, which is credited with reducing maternal and neonatal mortality rates in the country.Officials say they plan to arrange Rs200 million through an internal loan within the ministry and ask the Ministry of Finance for another Rs200 million to continue the programme.“Around Rs2.5 billion a year is required to conduct the safe motherhood programme throughout the country,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We have informed the health ministry about the budget crunch.”The government’s Safe Motherhood programme is credited with saving hundreds of maternal and neonatal lives every year. In addition to free delivery services, the programme provides mothers and babies with free medical treatment, a transportation allowance, and cash incentives for antenatal checkups.Women in the mountainous, hilly and Tarai districts receive Rs3,000, Rs2,000 and Rs1,000, respectively. Additionally, a cash bonus of Rs800 is provided to mothers who complete all eight antenatal checkups. The institutional delivery rate, which was around 18 percent before 2009, when the government declared free institutional delivery services, has increased to 80 percent.“We have been collecting bills from hospitals providing safe motherhood services,” said Joshi. “As it is a national priority programme, we cannot discontinue the services. We will send invoices to the Health Ministry for reimbursement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office.Earlier, the country had cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.Fatality due to poor access to medical services during childbirth remains a leading cause of women’s death in Nepal.Data provided by the division show that at least 50 women from 51 districts succumbed due to complications during childbirth since the start of the current fiscal year. Division’s data show that at least 190 women from 51 districts died from complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024. In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Health officials concede that the actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in only 51 districts of 77 districts.According to the latest census report, 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the health ministry concede that the deaths reported from 51 districts represent only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths across the country.Lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths, and the budget shortfall is to blame for the inability to carry out maternal and perinatal death surveillance, officials say.Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention to improve maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.The World Health Organisation said maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal. \nIn a bid to tackle persistent malnutrition problems, the Food Management and Trading Company has started selling micronutrient-blended rice in various places across the country, including the Kathmandu Valley.Officials hope that various problems caused by micronutrient deficiencies will come down once people start eating the rice fortified with crucial minerals.The company has already been selling micronutrient-blended rice in Karnali Province for the past one year, as malnutrition is more severe in the region compared to other parts of the country.“One might assume residents of the Kathmandu Valley don’t need micronutrient-fortified foods. But even in the capital, many people suffer from health problems linked to deficiencies of crucial micronutrients, including vitamin B12,” said Ambika Paudel, manager at the Sales and Distribution Department of the company.Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which fell from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.Paudel informed that the company has blended iron, zinc, vitamin A, Vitamin B12, B1, B2, B6, and folic acid into rice, the country's staple food. Though only iron, zinc, vitamin A, folic acid, and vitamin B12 are mandatory, the company has been blending additional micronutrients, such as vitamins B1, B2, and B6 as well. Consumers have to pay an additional Rs5 per kilo for the fortified rice, which is blended in Kathmandu, Surkhet, Janakpur and Jajarkot.Officials say they have been selling blended rice at market price in all five districts of Karnali Province. Fortified rice is available in 25kg sacks at the company’s outlets.“We received a grant to sell micronutrient blended rice at market price in the districts of Karnali Province,” said Paudel. “We hope this initiative will help address malnutrition there.”Malnutrition plays a major role in the under-five mortality rate, according to the nutrition section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. Experts say malnutrition also hinders children’s mental development, and eventually affects the country’s economic health by weakening intellectual capacity, reducing productivity in adulthood, and increasing vulnerability to diseases.Although the 2022 survey showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province suffer from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or underweight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.The country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the existing 32 percent by 2030 in order to meet the SDG targets, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.“Various measures are being taken to address the improvement of the nutrition status,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Micronutrient fortification in rice is one among several measures being taken to tackle the existing malnutrition problem. We hope that this measure will be effective.” \nNo additional mutated poliovirus has been detected in sewage samples collected from Kathmandu, the National Public Health Laboratory that regularly carries out environmental surveillance of highly contagious disease said.Since the presence of type-3 poliovirus in sewage samples was confirmed in May, the central laboratory has stepped up environmental surveillance of the virus, which causes deformities and paralysis in children.“No additional muted poliovirus has been detected in the sewage samples collected from Kathmandu Valley and other places,” said Dr Ranjan Raj Bhatta, director of the laboratory.“The National Institute of Health of Thailand, the World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre, which carried out further testing on samples we sent, also confirmed that no additional poliovirus has been detected.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared free of the disease by the World Health Organisation only on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years. After having zero human cases of polio for about 14 years, the infectious disease surfaced in the capital city’s sewage in May.Type-3 polio virus, which is vaccine-derived, had been detected in sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers.Health authorities launched a mass polio vaccination drive in the three districts of the Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur—following the confirmation of the virus in the sewage samples to prevent the outbreak. All children under five years of age will be inoculated with an additional dose of oral polio vaccine in the drive.Officials at the laboratory said they have been conducting environmental surveillance on a regular basis and sending samples to the UN agency’s reference laboratory in Thailand for cell culture, as the service is available only in a few laboratories across the world.The national laboratory collects samples from five tributaries in the Kathmandu Valley and from Koshi, Madhesh, and Gandaki provinces to check for the presence of the polio virus. Doctors say the polio virus mainly affects children and is usually transmitted through droplets or aerosols from the throat and by faecal contamination of hands, utensils, food and water. Those who do not wash their hands properly, and those who consume contaminated food and water or reside in an area where water and sanitation conditions are poor are at high risk of getting infected with the virus.The Health Ministry said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 percent throughout the country.Childhood immunisation is the government’s number one priority, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has shown remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nBrazil drew 1-1 with Uruguay in South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday after Gerson’s brilliant strike cancelled out Federico Valverde's opener for the visitors.Five-time World Cup winners Brazil are fifth in the CONMEBOL standings on 18 points, one point behind Colombia and Ecuador, after picking up their second straight draw.Uruguay are second on 20 points, five behind leaders Argentina.The top six will automatically qualify for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.After a tight first half, Real Madrid midfielder Valverde opened the scoring in the 55th minute when he curled a fine long-range low shot into the far corner.Gerson brought the hosts level seven minutes later, the Flamengo midfielder scoring his first international goal with a terrific volley after a poor clearance by the Uruguayan defence.“I’d actually swap my goal for the win,” Gerson told Brazil’s Globo TV. “We knew it was a tough game and we wanted to win. We conceded the goal and got the equaliser.“We’ll just have to keep working at our clubs and next year when there's another international break we can go for it. We just have to keep working and trust in our work.”Brazil pushed for a winner but late efforts from Luis Enrique and Raphinha went wide as boos from home fans at the Arena Fonte Nove rang out at the final whistle.“I think the booing is more about the result, because in my opinion we gave it all,” Raphinha said.“I’m proud of those who played and even those on the bench. We did everything we could to get the result. We played a lot of football and we have to leave with our heads held high.” \nArgentina striker Lautaro Martinez scored in the second half to secure a 1-0 home win against Peru in South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday.Martinez scored 10 minutes after the break, capitalising on a fine cross from Lionel Messi to fire home a half-volley into the top-right corner.The Inter Milan striker’s 32nd international goal moved him level with Diego Maradona in fifth spot in the country’s all-time scoring charts.The World Cup holders lead the CONMEBOL standings with 25 points, five clear of Uruguay who play later in the day at Brazil. Peru are bottom of the 10-team table with seven points after 12 games.The top six qualify automatically for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.Wasteful Colombia fall to 10-man Ecuador, Paraguay draw at Bolivia Colombia lost 1-0 at home to 10-man Ecuador in South America’s qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday while Julio Enciso’s late equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Paraguay at Bolivia.Paraguay, who beat Argentina 2-1 last week, are now unbeaten in six games and sit sixth on 17 points in the CONMEBOL standings. Bolivia are four points behind in seventh.The top six qualify automatically for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada while the team in seventh spot gain entry to the inter-confederation playoffs.Ecuador jumped to third on 19 points, with Colombia fourth on goal difference following their second straight loss.Ecuador struck in the seventh minute through Enner Valencia following a terrific solo run but the visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 34th minute when Piero Hincapie was sent off for denying Jhon Cordoba a clear goal-scoring opportunity.Colombia were unable to find an equaliser despite having 25 attempts on goal, including a Luis Diaz header that struck the post before halftime, while they were also frustrated by a solid performance from Ecuador goalkeeper Hernan Galindez.Bolivia looked to make home advantage count against Paraguay at 4,150m above sea level in El Alto and they took the lead after 15 minutes via Ervin Vaca's first international goal.The hosts squandered several chances to extend their lead and Miguel Almiron found the equaliser for Paraguay with a first-time finish off a pass from Enciso in the 71st minute.Bolivia went ahead again nine minutes later when Miguel Terceros made no mistake from the penalty spot but Enciso halted the home fans’ celebrations early in stoppage time with a superb strike from the edge of the box.Paraguay came close to pulling out a last-gasp victory but goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra pulled off a brilliant save to deny Ramon Sosa. \nChina’s defense ministry blamed the United States’ stance on Taiwan for its minister not meeting his US counterpart during a gathering this week in Laos.Defence Minister Dong Jun turned down the US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s request to meet during a gathering of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) defense ministers, US officials said on Wednesday.“The US side cannot undermine China's core interests on the Taiwan issue while engaging with the Chinese military as if nothing is wrong,” a ministry spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday.The remarks raised questions over whether only a change in US policy towards the island can restore military-to-military talks at the defense minister level between the two countries. The failure to meet is “entirely the responsibility” of the US, the Chinese spokesperson said.The spokesperson also urged the US to “immediately correct its mistakes” and strive to create favourable conditions for high-level military exchanges between the two sides.China views democratically-governed Taiwan as its own territory, a claim that Taiwan’s government rejects.The US is Taiwan’s most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the lack of formal diplomatic recognition.Austin told reporters on Wednesday that the fact his Chinese counterpart declined to meet did not have any implications for the future.“I just think that it’s something that they chose to do at this point in time and only they can explain why they chose to not take advantage of a good opportunity,” he added.Divisions and anger spilled into the open at COP29 on Thursday as the closing deadline neared.Austin met China’s defense minister on the sidelines of a Singapore conference earlier this year, reiterating their differences on Taiwan and other issues but emphasizing the need to keep military-to-military communications open. \nThe United States rejected a decision by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense chief, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said.“The United States fundamentally rejects the Court’s decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials. We remain deeply concerned by the Prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision,” the spokesperson said, adding the US is discussing the next steps with its partners.Israel’s 13-month campaign in Gaza has killed about 44,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly all the enclave’s population while creating a humanitarian crisis, Gaza officials say. \nThe International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief, as well as a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict.In their decision, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a “widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza.”The decision was met with outrage in Israel, which called it shameful and absurd. Hamas welcomed the warrants against the Israelis, and a senior official told Reuters it was a first step towards justice.The warrant for Masri lists charges of mass killings during the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that triggered the Gaza war, and also charges of rape and the taking of hostages.Israel has said it killed Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, in an airstrike in July but Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied this. The prosecution indicated it would continue to gather information with respect to his reported death.Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza. The United States, Israel’s main diplomatic supporter, is also not a member of the ICC.ICC prosecutor Karim Khan had announced on May 20 that he was seeking arrest warrants for alleged crimes connected to the Hamas-led attacks on Israel and the Israeli military response in Gaza. Israeli and Hamas leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes.The court does not have its own police force to carry out arrests and relies on its 124 member states for that. Whether they are arrested or not depends on the member states. They have an obligation to do so but the court has only limited diplomatic means to force them if they do not want to.ReactionsNetanyahu’s office said the ICC decision was “anti-semitic” and he will “not yield to pressure, will not be deterred” until Israel's war objectives are met.The ICC has “lost all legitimacy” after issuing the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said.“A dark moment for the International Criminal Court,” Saar said on X, adding that it had issued “absurd orders without authority.”There was no immediate comment from Gallant.In a statement, Hamas welcomed the warrants against Gallant and Netanyahu and urged the court to expand accountability to all Israeli leaders.Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters the warrants against the Israelis were an important step towards bringing justice for the victims.\"But it remains a limited and spiritual step if it was not backed practically by all countries to get this decision implemented in compliance with law and justice,\" he said.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the decision was not a political one but made by a court and thus should be respected and implemented. “The tragedy in Gaza has to stop,” Borrell said.Jordan’s foreign minister Ayman Safadi also said the ICC’s decision must be implemented, adding that the Palestinians deserved justice after what he termed Israel's “war crimes” in Gaza.The Netherlands’ foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp said his country was prepared to act upon the warrants, Dutch news agency ANP reported.In the United States, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, said: “The Court is a dangerous joke. It is now time for the U.S. Senate to act and sanction this irresponsible body.”Israel’s 13-month campaign in Gaza has killed about 44,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly all the enclave’s population while creating a humanitarian crisis, Gaza officials say.It launched the campaign in response to the October 2023, Hamas-led attack which killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, with more than 250 others taken hostage, Israel has said. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nDating from the 13th century, the Kumari tradition in Nepal worships young girls as goddesses until they menstruate, with Matina Shakya being appointed in 2008 and replaced by Trishna Shakya in 2017 amidst evolving practices like education and support for ex-Kumaris.\nJuddha Shumsher Rana built a zoo in Jawalakhel Durbar in 1932, featuring a variety of animals including elephants, horses, deer, tigers, rhinos, leopards, red pandas, pheasants, and a lion.\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf plans a nationwide rally on November 24th to demand the release of imprisoned leader Imran Khan, amidst ongoing tensions with the military establishment.\nHuman activities have irreversibly altered the planet's ecosystem, pushing it beyond recovery and resulting in the Anthropocene epoch, which poses significant challenges for South Asia, particularly with regard to poverty and climate change, although awareness and cross-border cooperation remain deficient.\nDaman Nath Dhungana, a former Speaker and prominent Nepali figure, was known for his advocacy of democracy, human rights, and social justice, despite some controversies in his career.\nA drop in temperature has brought with it a sharp decline in air quality. Smog shrouds the skies, obscuring the hills and mountains surrounding Kathmandu Valley. While this is concerning, visuals of air pollution in the neighbouring countries have alarmed the world. Last week, images of the nearly invisible Taj Mahal and India Gate went viral. Further, the smog in parts of Pakistan and northern India was so dense that it was visible from space. According to the WHO, air with AQI values above 300 is labelled hazardous. It is only a matter of time before Kathmandu Valley and other parts of Nepal face a fate similar to India’s New Delhi and Pakistan’s Lahore, where AQI values have surpassed 1,000.Nepal is the third most polluted country in the world, according to a 2024 report by Air Quality Life Index (AQLI). Particulate pollution is the leading threat to human health in Nepal measured in life expectancy, reducing it by 3.4 years. By comparison, tobacco use cuts life expectancy by 1.9 years, while dietary risks and high blood pressure reduce it by 1.5 years each. What’s more, Nepal’s 30.7 million people live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline. Pretty much the same story repeats every year. On Thursday, Lalitpur’s air quality index reached 238 at 12:45 pm, getting closer to hazardous levels. Experts warned that air quality would go downhill in the coming days as farmers both in India and Pakistan clear fields after the autumn harvest. According to a recent report by Reuters, the burning of stubble left after harvesting rice has contributed to 40 percent of the pollution in Delhi. Such a dangerous practice in the Indo-Gangetic plains is bound to affect Nepal. We cannot solely blame our neighbours when we also indulge in harmful practices. A previous study shows that around three million tonnes of agricultural residue are burnt in the Tarai region. Besides these, emissions from vehicles, brick kilns, and open burning are among the country’s significant sources of pollution. If consumed for long, these pollutants are detrimental to our health. According to a 2024 report by the State of Global Air (SOGA), 75 percent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 39 percent of lung cancer deaths were attributed to air pollution. Even as our leaders inhale the same toxic air, their response to tackling air pollution has been woefully inadequate. While actions like banning open burning and monitoring brick kiln emissions have been introduced, they are limited to some local units. Even if vehicles pass emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and get green stickers, they still emit black smoke, as many only service them before the annual pollution tests. In response, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has purchased a smoke metre to test emissions from such automobiles.Although these actions are commendable, the federal government must do more. Exhaust from public vehicles is a major problem. Even as nearly 12,000 battery-powered vehicles were imported last year, these were primarily private ones. The government should open avenues for people to switch to eco-friendly ways of cooking and travelling. If we act seriously to reduce particulate pollution to WHO guidelines, countless lives could be saved. Additionally, residents of Tarai and Kathmandu could gain 4.8 and 2.6 years of life expectancy, respectively. While tackling domestic sources of air pollution is essential, it is as important to acknowledge its transboundary nature. Only a coordinated, collective, multinational effort can help clean up the air we breathe.  \nNepal’s hydroelectric potential is huge, with an estimated capacity of 40,000 megawatts. Nonetheless, the country has been unable to realise even a fraction of its potential due to limited market access and an unfavourable political climate. As a result, currently, the country generates just around 3,000 megawatts. The recent power trade with Bangladesh through India’s grid, however, could mark a turning point. Under the deal, yearly, 40 MW of electricity will be exported to Bangladesh for five years, from June 15 to November 15. This follows a tripartite agreement between the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, the Nepal Electricity Authority and the Bangladesh Power Development Board on October 3, 2024. The export, initially envisioned in 2018, was finally inaugurated on Friday. The agreement offers several advantages to all the countries and stakeholders involved. First, it strengthens regional cooperation and boosts economic development of these countries. Second, it promotes green energy in Bangladesh by reducing its reliance on fossil fuels. A 2022-23 government report of Bangladesh reveals that the country relies mostly on natural gas to meet its energy demand, and hydroelectricity accounts for only 1 percent of the total energy generation—24,911 MW. Nepal will also greatly benefit from this trade as it offers a chance to cut its trade deficit, which stands at Rs1.44 trillion; the agreement is expected to generate Rs330 million annually. Further, as Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line, the southern neighbour can also benefit from it.This agreement highlights the positive outcomes of nations working together for shared goals. It remains to be seen how sustainable it is though. Efforts should be made to facilitate uninterrupted electricity transmission, as international market access is crucial, especially for Nepal. While India’s willingness to facilitate power exports to Bangladesh is welcome, Nepal’s sole dependency on its southern neighbour for energy trade also cannot be denied. Without direct territorial links, Nepal’s ability to independently access foreign markets remains constrained. To overcome this, establishing a South Asian energy grid would be a game changer, enabling energy exchanges and opening avenues to harness the vast hydroelectric potential of the Himalayan region. Gaining India’s confidence and support for initiatives that enhance sub-regional productivity is vital in this regard. India therein also has a great opportunity to show that it is indeed a true leader of South Asia. As crucial as the agreement may seem, this agreement has only set a precedent. Nepal plans to produce 28,500 megawatts by 2035, so it must address a range of technical and regulatory hurdles to ensure both smooth production and cross-border transmission. Equally important is developing infrastructure to maximise the country’s electricity production. Again, concerted efforts from all South Asian countries can help the region increase its renewable energy generation and also boost sub-regional connectivity. The success of the Nepal-Bangladesh electricity export agreement offers a promising starting point for the realisation of these goals. What happens next will depend on the will of the Nepali political class to continuously follow the path of national prosperity.    \nPrime Minister and CPN-UML Chair KP Sharma Oli is not someone who minces his words. So when Oli was asked at the recent Kantipur Conclave whether he was worried about visiting China before going to India, it was interesting to see him struggle for the right words. He eventually said something along the lines that it is hard to discern which of the two neighbours is more important and should be his first port of call. Just so that the Indians are not spooked, he added “our relations with India are deep, historical, based on culture and tradition, and predate the formation of modern states.” Ever since he became prime minister around four months ago, PM Oli has been desperately trying to get an invite from New Delhi. This was why he had sat on an earlier offer to visit China. But when he saw that New Delhi was in no mood to invite him, Oli decided to visit Beijing first. Perhaps it was also a not-so-subtle signal to India that if it is not ready to engage with him, he will not be afraid to sidle closer to China.Balancing India and China would have been tricky for Prime Minister Oli irrespective of the kind of coalition he led. But as the head of a government where he is the prime minister but not the leader of the biggest party presents him with unique challenges. During his 2016 China trip following the Indian blockade, both the electorate and most political parties were strongly in favour of greater engagement with the northern neighbour. But this time, even his main coalition partner does not want him to sign any consequential agreements with China. The Nepali Congress says Nepal should not accept any loan under the Belt and Road Initiative. Rather than sign new agreements, it is in favour of asking the Chinese to follow through on their previous pledges. In other words, short of getting the Chinese to waive off the loan for the Pokhara International Airport—which, though a very long shot, could be a huge coup for the prime minister—Oli will struggle to portray his China visit as a success. If there can be no domestic political mileage for Oli, why go to China and risk losing face at home, even some UML leaders are asking? Whether a Nepali prime minister visits New Delhi or Beijing first, it should be up to Nepal to decide. That is not a big issue. What is more of a concern is that even when our prime minister embarks on a state visit to China, domestic political calculus rather than national interest will guide his decisions. So far, neither is the Congress ready to give him more of a leeway in negotiating with the Chinese nor is the UML in a place to say that it will do no important business with China. In the latter event, the Beijing visit will be reduced to a formality even before Oli embarks on it. This is not how coalitions work. How can people trust the government with anything if its constituent parties cannot even agree on how to deal with Nepal’s two most important international partners? And what does it say about the executive authority of the prime minister? The ruling coalition needs to immediately sort out its foreign policy mess before the country suffers an irreparable loss of trust abroad. \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is preparing to visit China in the first week of December. It will be his first bilateral visit after assuming the office in mid-July. Nepali prime ministers generally go to New Delhi first. Sudheer Sharma, former editor-in-chief of Kantipur daily, has recently published a pair of books on Nepal-China relations—‘Himalpari ko Huri’ and ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’. He also frequently writes on Nepal’s relations with its two big neighbours. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Sharma on the eve of Oli’s China visit. Prime Minister Oli is all set to visit China next month. Many find it curious that he decided to go to Beijing first before visiting New Delhi. How do you see this development?Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have given high priority to visits and engagements with our two neighbours–India and China. This is natural. Generally, the prime ministers first visited India and then went to China. I believe Prime Minister Oli tried to do the same. We see regular engagements with New Delhi at various levels. Prime Minister Oli had met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in the last week of September. In August, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India and met Prime Minister Modi and her counterpart S Jaishankar, among other key officials there. But Delhi has yet to extend the invitation to the prime minister. So he seems to have decided not to defer his foreign visits for long and chose to visit Beijing first. We have to see this in two perspectives. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and he is also going to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even in the past, Oli developed good relations with Chinese leaders. So, there are expectations that he may make the visit fruitful. An equally important concern is whether this visit impacts our relations with the southern neighbour India. I think the prime minister should focus on implementing the agreements reached during his previous visits to Beijing and during Chinese leaders’ Nepal visits. He should be mindful of not irking the southern neighbour while reaching any agreement with the northern one. I believe the prime minister is conscious of this.India often seems anxious about Chinese involvement in Nepal. Do you see any risk of this visit increasing the distance between Oli and India?Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited China first after he became prime minister in 2008. Even in the past, some Nepali prime ministers including Tanka Prasad Acharya went to China on their first official visit. This is not unusual. The two prime ministers—Oli and Modi—recently met in New York. India doesn’t seem ready to intensify bilateral engagements with Nepal immediately. So it is natural for the prime minister to increase engagements with China, without taking any steps that could provoke India. We should stop seeking Indian signals when dealing with China, and vice versa. We should maintain parallel relations with both the neighbours without antagonising any side.In this context, what should be the prime minister’s priorities during his China visit?We have to end our chronic problem of signing agreements and not implementing them. We make announcements and forget them. There are also some infrastructure projects China pledged to develop but there is little progress. So the prime minister should draw the Chinese leadership’s attention and press them to complete the projects on time. Some important projects such as Mugling-Pokhara and Narayanghat-Butwal road upgradation by the Chinese side have been slow, causing hardships to people. Even such issues should be communicated to the political level. Also, there are several commitments made by the Chinese government but left unimplemented. This creates an impression that China makes big promises but doesn’t keep them. Prime Minister Oli often highlights the Tokha-Chhahare road upgrade project under Chinese support but there is no satisfactory progress. Progress on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) on Nepal-China cross-border railway is unclear as well. Nepal expected some substantive support from China to make the Pokhara international airport financially feasible. Some concrete steps are needed to operate this airport. There are reports that the government has requested China to convert the loan taken to develop the airport into a grant and the prime minister will push for this during his visit. It will be an achievement if the prime minister succeeds in this. In the course of writing your recent books, you extensively interacted with Chinese officials and experts, as well as with their Nepali counterparts. What are the major factors delaying the projects? Is it lack of preparation on the Nepali side or is there any problem on the Chinese side?First, we [Nepalis] sign agreements but don’t work seriously to implement them. This is true in the case of agreements with other countries as well. We are negligent. Red tape is another problem. Third, China gives less priority to small countries like Nepal as it has so many big issues with other countries. We have to constantly follow up with them to speed things up. In the past, the two sides agreed to open more border points. This should be expedited. The people-to-people relations on the border areas were historically based on social interactions at the community level. People used to trade, marry those from the other side and interact in various ways. Of late, despite progress on infrastructure development, social engagement has been hindered. This should be rectified and new border points should be opened at Dolpa, Mustang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Taplejung, and Sankhuwasabha. We should think beyond the Capital-centric approach. This will help strengthen relations at the people’s level and give alternatives in our connectivity. We should put connectivity at the core of our relations with the two neighbours. In the past decade, we have made good progress in improving connectivity with India. A study report has been prepared on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway project. We are building an expressway linking Kathmandu and the southern belt of the country. Integrated check posts (ICPs) have come into operation along Nepal-India border points. Cross border electricity transmission lines have been built and we have increased energy trade with India. We have thus progressed in deepening connectivity with India. We lack reliable north-south highways. Therefore, the prime minister should make connectivity a major agenda of his China visit. Given the lacklustre performance of past projects, can we be optimistic about big cross-border infra projects under Chinese help?Nepal and China have committed to run some projects under the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) concept. A key component of this concept is to upgrade connectivity between Kathmandu and Kerung that includes roads as well as a railway. The concept also envisions operating other border points. The railway project requires more study and investment and needs to consider various other factors. For now, we should prioritise opening the aforementioned border points. The Korala border point at Mustang has huge potential. Nepal is making a road that connects Mustang with the Sunauli border point with India. Centuries ago, people from Banaras used to travel to Tibet via Mustang through this route. It can be revived and made a trilateral trade route between Nepal, India and China. Similarly, Limi in Humla, Olangchugola in Taplejung, among others places, can be developed as alternative routes. As far as Kerung-Kathmandu connection is concerned, let’s first give priority to building a reliable highway. The railway project should be developed with a broader understanding between Nepal, India and China. Beijing will develop such a big project only with the big Indian markets in mind. More importantly, there are some signs of improvements in India-China relations. We have to use this as an opportunity.There are differences in the way we work and the Chinese do and there are systemic and linguistic differences as well. These factors are often blamed for lack of progress in development activities carried out with Chinese support. Can Nepalis work closely with Chinese, just like we do with Indians?Until a decade ago, several projects developed under Indian support were left in limbo. In 2015, India imposed a blockade against Nepal and that sparked anti-India sentiment. Then, India expedited several projects. This drastic change became possible as the political leadership in India realised its mistake and showed the commitment to improve things.But the same thing is not happening with China because there is a “great wall” between Nepal and China when it comes to understanding each other. The Chinese haven’t understood Nepali context. The northern neighbour should be more open and liberal in helping Nepal. Second, Nepal should also stop approaching China only when our relations with India sour. We have left this impression on the Chinese psyche. First, we should be clear about what exactly we want from China, forge consensus among major political forces and hold talks with the Chinese leaders. Then, we should be equally committed to implementing the agreements reached this way. People now take announcements of building big projects under Chinese support as propaganda. Therefore, this time the prime minister should stress on pushing the pending projects. The prime minister should tell them that even the projects announced during President Xi’s visit have not progressed and that has created a bad impression of China in Nepal.There are some differences between the coalition partners—the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress—about the funding modality of projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). Do you think this may cause a problem?The UML wants to expedite the BRI projects while the Congress has insisted that we should accept only grants and not loans under the BRI. The prime minister should clear such dilemmas and come up with common views before he leaves for Beijing. Once they come up with a common view on such key issues, it will give a positive and strong message. The Chinese side will take it more seriously because the strong government led by the two largest parties can implement bilateral agreements.We have instances of Nepal’s political parties standing for and against important projects funded by other countries. This was seen in the case of the US-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and China’s BRI. Moreover, in the past, the Chinese leaders created an impression that they preferred working with communist parties and leaders. This is neither in the interest of Nepal nor of China.There are also discussions on signing the BRI implementation plan during the visit. What are the things Nepal should be careful about while signing BRI-related agreements?Trying to get grants instead of loans is in itself good. But there is no need to be prejudiced against the BRI per se. Nepal reportedly wants to include some points specifying waivers in specific projects. We should be very careful while signing project-based agreements. For instance, what will be the conditions and funding modality of a project, will it be developed under grants or loans etcetera. All our technical experts and other brains should be engaged while signing project-based agreements and specifying conditions and other nitty-gritty to ensure that we will not have unnecessary liability and debt burden in the future. Over time, Nepal has rightly adopted a steadfast position saying that we don’t join a strategic alliance proposed by any country. It stayed away from the US government’s State Partnership Programme (SPP) and China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI) as well as from India’s security umbrella. But we can’t be isolated in development initiatives. We have to take support from India, China, the US and other countries based on our needs.Do you think the Chinese side will show magnanimity on Nepal’s requests, for instance on waiving off the loan to develop Pokhara international airport?Though the Chinese ambassador to Nepal last year claimed the airport project to be under the BRI, the case is different because it was signed years before we joined the BRI. And, converting that loan into a grant is not a big deal for China. They should show magnanimity given the support we have been providing to China for a long time. If you see things historically, Nepal has helped China by suppressing Khampa revolt, preventing free Tibet movements on our soil and showing a steadfast commitment to One-China policy. China, which is now prosperous, should definitely show magnanimity and waive off loan of Pokhara airport. They shouldn’t see relations with Nepal through a purely transactional lens.In your book, you describe 2008 as a watershed after which the engagements between Nepal and China increased drastically. But why couldn’t we benefit from the northern neighbour in terms of development?The Chinese side looks more interested in increasing engagement. They like to showcase their development before foreigners. But more than lavish hospitality, we need substantive support from the neighbour, which has emerged as the world’s second-largest economy. But we should be clear about what we want from our engagements with China.  The Nepali side doesn’t present its proposals clearly. On certain issues, our politicians give mixed signals. This time, if this government of two largest parties reaches a certain agreement with China and remains committed to implement it, other forces can’t hinder it. The same approach can be replicated while dealing with India, the US, Japan or other friendly countries.Is difficult geography still a barrier in developing cross-border infrastructure projects and deepening relations between Nepal and China?In our textbooks we read that the Himalayan range is a natural barrier between the two countries. In my book ‘Bhikshu Byapar ra Bidroha’, I have explored and described how people from Nepal and northern India had been traversing through these mountains and there were interactions and engagements between the people in this part of the world since the 5th and 6th centuries. So, the mountains weren’t barriers even at that time. Now technology has made things easier. We have to think about how to connect with these two big economies. We have multiple east-west highways. Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries. \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nThe weather will be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of the country on Thursday, with fair skies across most of the country.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nA task force has been created to revise Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plan, addressing concerns from the Nepali Congress party regarding funding and implementation, ahead of Prime Minister KP Oli's upcoming visit to China.\nNumerous districts in Nepal, including Kathmandu Valley, are at high risk for cholera outbreaks due to poor sanitation and hygiene, necessitating surveillance and vaccination efforts along with water and sanitation improvements to eliminate the disease.\nRastriya Swatantra Party faces turmoil after arrest of its president, Rabi Lamichhane, on embezzlement charges, leading to confusion and changes in protest strategy, putting its future in jeopardy.\nDespite a government ban on construction in the Budhi Gandaki hydropower project area, Gandaki province allocated funds to pave a road to Arughat Bazaar, affecting the project's progress, resettlement, and local livelihoods, particularly in Arughat Bazaar, which faces declining business and population exodus due to stalled development and unresolved land acquisition issues.\nHaving to choose between saving the mother or the child during a complicated pregnancy is a trope adopted by many movies and plays as their narrative crux. Adopting such tropes simplifies the plot, adding nothing but predictable melodrama.Directed by Kedar Shrestha and produced by Dayahang Rai, the play ‘DhukDhuki 72 Megahertz’ revolves around the same theme. However, its layered narrative breaks free from cliched storytelling. The play opens with the wife (Menuka Pradhan) caressing her baby bump. Her husband (Karma) enters the stage, and affectionate banter follows. The couple shares their views on life, patriarchy, motherhood, and love. As the conversation unfolds to its depth, the audience learns that the wife is a teacher interested in writing poetry, while the husband is an artist by profession. During their conversation, the actors explore ongoing yet concealed discourses about patriarchy. This dismantles the belief that men alone are the enforcers of patriarchy. It highlights how patriarchal settings influence women to think and act in a patriarchal way, manifesting in their behaviour and beliefs. As the play progresses, lighting stands out as a powerful tool. It complements the depth of the dialogues, which are rich in literature and philosophy. One dialogue, “To understand light, one must first experience darkness,” is accompanied by the husband lighting the dim stage. This lighting shift shows the synchrony between the stage setting and the dialogues.In one scene, the couple is preparing for a maternity photoshoot. The husband teases his wife, questioning the ideologies she once subscribed to. The wife says with conviction, “The heart has defeated the mind. I want to experience the full essence of motherhood.”Her dialogue reflects the inner complexities of human beings, which are as sublime as a river. This scene taps into human beings’ raw and unfiltered nature, which is untainted and untouched by the weight of any ideological grandeur.Through the exchange of dialogues between the wife and the husband, the writer of this play is also seen to be critiquing the audience’s tendency to seek definitive interpretations of art instead of trusting their understanding. This is evident when the husband complains to his wife about a visitor at his art exhibition, who keeps hurling questions at him about his artwork. This scene reminded me of the time when I watched the movie ‘Shambhala’. After the film’s end, a viewer asked the cast what happened at the end, hinting at a need for closure rather than relying on their interpretation of the film. As the couple prepares for their photoshoot, the husband kisses his wife’s baby bump, saying, “Even husbands have some elements of motherhood in them.” This scene scored laughter from the audience. Through this scene, the director was clever enough to satirise such men who contribute little at home yet consider themselves paragons of balance between work and family. As the play progresses to its main plot, the wife is admitted to the hospital. The husband receives devastating news about complications in his wife’s pregnancy. The play now deals with a difficult juncture: is the baby to be saved or the mother?The wife decides to save the baby. Next, the duo argue, during which the husband questions her willingness to leave him behind. However, the wife firmly defends her agency, asserting her right to decide for her body. After this scene, the extensive cries and wallows may lead one to perceive the play as celebrating women asserting their rights. However, the true beauty of the play lies in its refusal to glorify any particular theme. Instead, it presents the reality of individuals navigating their ideologies and emotions.The wife epitomises the idea that ‘you cannot philosophise your way out of a traffic jam,’ which means that one’s feelings and innate experiences shape and dictate the paths for us to walk on.The long pauses taken by the cast amplify the essence of the play, allowing them to immerse themselves in the emotions they convey on stage. For instance, after putting on a brave face about the complications of the pregnancy in front of his wife, the husband breaks down alone in the hospital. This scene acts as a cathartic release, both for the character and the audience.The stage design remains consistent throughout the play, with elements creatively adapted to serve multiple purposes. A prominent feature is the tree in the middle of the stage. It acts as a symbol of many things. Initially, the tree represents nature and serves as a space where the wife and the husband share their deepest feelings. Similarly, the picture of the baby in the womb is projected in the tree, depicting the natural essence of childbirth. In grief, the wife always goes near the tree and converses with herself. Her inclination towards the tree reflects her need for connection to the natural world.Likewise, both characters' conversation about love takes the form of a tough love talk. During one exchange, the wife defines love as “Something to be felt, and that feeling is never going to be lost.” This subjectifies the definition of love. In this way, the play has tried to give meaning to the undefined emotion of love.The play's thematic resonance occurs when the audience is made to see the vision seen by the wife. In her vision, the wife hears her baby speaking to her while still in the womb. When she asks how the child can speak, the child explains that it can communicate and feel everything the mother feels through the umbilical cord.This connection is akin to a radio—when plugged in, it plays music. The radio serves a recurring role throughout the play, with a love song by Kumar Sanu being played. Just as the radio connects to the music, the umbilical cord connects the mother and child, much like the baby’s voice, which can be seen as a love song for the mother.This is where the concept of ‘DhukDhuki’ ties in. For many, hearing Kumar Sanu’s love song makes their DhukDhuki (heartbeat) rise. For mothers, hearing their baby’s voice is their true ‘DhukDhuki’, a heartbeat of love and connection.The wife talks about how ‘DhukDhuki’ is a metaphor for life’s continuity. For her, the DhukDhuki symbolises the growing baby inside her, once again reflecting the natural process of life. In this sense, the baby represents nature’s everlasting cycle, and the love the wife has for her child symbolises the importance of love, highlighting how essential love is in an individual's life.The play, which runs for 90 minutes with just two actors, is an exemplary display of artistry. The actor’s ability to laugh and cry convincingly on stage deserves commendation.The story suits anyone looking to forget societal norms and expectations and immerse themselves in a deeply cathartic experience.DhukDhuki 72 MegahertzDirector: Kedar ShresthaCast: Menuka Pradhan, KarmaWhere: Mandala Theatre, Thapagaun, KathmanduShowtimes: Every day at 5:30 pm (except Monday) and an extra 1:00 pm show on Saturday until December 1.  \nNepal faces challenges in balancing free speech protection with regulating fake news and misinformation online, as exemplified by the arrest of Durga Prasai for falsely accusing the Prime Minister, prompting concerns about the Social Media Bill that may undermine free speech.\nNepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba is a man of few words. He rarely makes public statements, and when he does, his remarks are peculiarly straightforward, lacking subtext.Yet, a recent comment he made—that the KP Oli government is doing a good job—stood out. Despite its brevity, the comment carried a hint of hidden meaning.One may wonder how Deuba, who has himself served as prime minister and is angling for a sixth term, would explain just what “good job” the Oli government has done so far. In fact, in the more than four months since Deuba elevated Oli to the prime minister’s seat, the coalition has yet to deliver anything that justifies such a claim.The current government has fallen short on nearly every front, mirroring the failures of the previous administration under Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal. So why, then, is Deuba so enthusiastically heaping praise on Oli, his long-time political adversary?More than meets the eyeDeuba has a long political history, and his contributions to democratic changes cannot be ignored. But he is not the man who inspires hope. His five previous stints as prime minister were marred by governance failures and a general lack of vision. Deuba, however, has a reputation as a shrewd political player, just like his contemporaries—Oli and Dahal. But there is a contrast. He is adept at manoeuvring in the shadows and pulling off backroom deals. The other two are more loquacious, outspoken and effervescent, with their political strategies often playing out in full public view.Securing a power-sharing deal with Oli was nothing short of a masterstroke for Deuba, especially since he did so at a time when his party members, particularly the two general secretaries, were vehemently opposed to joining a coalition government until the next elections. Yet, he offered the government leadership to the wily Oli on a platter while managing to quell the dissenters.Some Congress leaders privately admit that Deuba’s intentions are often difficult to discern, given his tendency to talk less and keep his cards close. In the 2022 elections, Congress was voted as the single largest party, making it the natural claimant to the government, yet it has been content, or been forced to be, to play second fiddle. It’s not difficult to comprehend the unease Deuba may have been going through for not being able to wield power as the head of the government.The silence of the criticsDeuba knows in his heart that Oli is not a man to be trusted, yet his submission to the latter is befuddling. Interestingly, the same general secretaries who tirelessly opposed Congress’s involvement in a coalition are now conspicuously silent, even offering to facilitate Deuba’s pathway to a sixth term. Their uncanny silence appears to have given Deuba free rein in the party.Gagan Thapa, one of the general secretaries who fiercely advocated for staying in the opposition until the next elections, now seems to have muted his voice—perhaps in hopes of eventually leading the party himself in return for helping Deuba secure the top job.What’s also intriguing is that Thapa has chosen not to raise issues of corruption, irregularities and governance failures with the same intensity he used to until a few months ago. A vocal critic of the so-called political mechanisms that coalition parties often institute to oversee government functions, Thapa has now consented to be part of a similar mechanism formed by Oli and Deuba. He seems to have realised that it’s better to play along with Deuba, as exhausting energy on stopping him from becoming prime minister—as long as Oli keeps his promise—is an effort wasted.Those rooting for Thapa may argue that the general secretary is now in a “strength-building” exercise, with his sights set on the next general convention. However, in Congress, where factionalism runs deep, the future is uncertain. Thapa, long seen as a leader who could inject new ideas into Congress and steer the party in the right direction, risks becoming a spent force due to his vacillations and ambivalence, as well as external factors. The rise of independent candidates and new political forces, particularly the Rastriya Swatantra Party, has become a formidable challenge. While Thapa’s struggle within the party is immense, he faces competition not only from the old guard but also from the new wave.On the question of credibility, public trust in Congress, UML and the Maoist Centre is at an all-time low. Nepali voters view the major parties as tainted and corrupt. Even if one argues that a leader’s personal integrity is separate from their political record, the two are intrinsically linked. It’s not enough for politicians to be clean; they must also appear clean.How long Thapa can sustain his fight for change remains to be seen. The last temptationDeuba’s power rests firmly in his hold over the party. But in the coming days, the dynamics within Congress are bound to change, and he wants to forge the path to Baluwatar while the party is still under his control. He knows that, in time, the party mantle needs to be passed to the next generation.Just shy of 80, Deuba faces what is likely his last chance at power—a chance that is wholly contingent on Oli. Despite being well aware of Oli’s infamous unpredictability, Deuba sees him as his best bet for securing one more term.Still, Deuba has yet to make a convincing case for what he might accomplish if he makes it to Singha Durbar with Oli’s support. Of all people, he understands the challenges of running a coalition, especially with a partner as unpredictable as Oli. Yet, Deuba is a patient man. His reticence works to his advantage. He knows well that a little flattery costs nothing, and he has been generously showering it on Oli. So “democratic and liberal” is Deuba that he easily shakes off criticism and doesn’t mind being called submissive if it means his ultimate goal—the prime ministerial seat—remains within reach. A party for posterity, however, does not seem to be at the top of his agenda. The grand old party seems to be sinking, dragged down by Deuba’s questionable allegiance to Oli in pursuit of personal ambitions. \nFrom Iraq to Afghanistan to the US, basic freedoms for women are being eroded as governments start rolling back existing laws.Just a few months ago a ban on Afghan women speaking in public was the latest measure introduced by the Taliban, who took back control of the country in 2021. From August the ban included singing, reading aloud, reciting poetry and even laughing outside their homes.The Taliban’s ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice, which implements one of the most radical interpretations of Islamic law, enforces these rules. They are part of a broader set of “vice and virtue” laws that severely restrict women’s rights and freedoms. Women are even banned from reading the Quran out loud to other women in public.In the past three years in Afghanistan, the Taliban has taken away many basic rights from women who live there, so that there’s very little that they are allowed to do. From 2021, the Taliban started introducing restrictions on girls receiving education, starting with a ban on coeducation and then a ban on girls attending secondary schools. This was followed by closing blind girls’ schools in 2023, and making it mandatory for girls in grades four to six (ages nine to 12) to cover their faces on the way to school.Women can no longer attend universities or receive a degree certificate nationally, or follow midwifery or nursing training in the Kandahar region. Women are no longer allowed to be flight attendants, or to take a job outside the home. Women-run bakeries in the capital Kabul have now been banned. Women are mostly now unable to earn any money, or leave their homes. In April 2024, the Taliban in Helmand province told media outlets to even refrain from airing women’s voices.Afghanistan is ranked last on the Women, Peace and Security Index and officials at the UN and elsewhere have called it “gender apartheid”. Afghan women are putting their lives on the line—facing surveillance, harassment, assault, arbitrary detention, torture and exile—to protest against the Taliban.Many diplomats discuss how important it is to “engage” with the Taliban, yet this has not stopped the assault on women’s rights. When diplomats “engage”, they tend to focus on counter-terrorism, counternarcotics, business deals, or hostage returns. Despite everything that has happened to Afghan women over a short period, critics suggest this rarely makes it onto diplomats’ priority list.Iraq’s age of consentMeanwhile, in Iraq, on August 4 2024, an amendment to Iraq’s 1959 personal status law which would possibly lower the age of consent for marriage to nine years old from 18 (or 15 with permission from a judge and parents) was proposed by member of parliament Ra’ad al-Maliki and supported by conservative Shia factions in the government.The law would have the potential of having matters of family law—such as marriage—adjudicated by religious authorities. This change could not only legalise child marriage but also strip women of rights related to divorce, child custody and inheritance.Iraq already has a high rate of underage marriage, with 7 percent of girls married by 15 years old, and 28 percent married before the legal age of 18. Unregistered marriages, not legally recorded in court but conducted through religious or tribal authorities, prevent girls from accessing civil rights, and leave women and girls vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and neglect, with limited options for seeking justice.Many women’s groups have already mobilised against the law. But the amendment has passed its second reading in parliament. If introduced, it could pave the way for further modifications that deepen sectarian divides and move the country further away from a unified legal system. It would also be an especially troubling step backward in protecting children’s rights and gender equality.Abortion rights in the USMeanwhile, in the US, women’s access to abortion has been eroded significantly in the past few years. In late 2021, the US was officially labelled a backsliding democracy by an international thinktank. Six months later, the landmark US Supreme Court ruling of Roe v Wade, which had safeguarded the constitutional right to abortion for nearly 50 years, was overturned. This led to a cascade of restrictive laws, with more than a quarter of US states enacting outright bans or severe restrictions on abortion.Republican US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene suggested, in May 2022, that women should stay celibate if they did not want to get pregnant. If only all women had that choice. In fact, in the US a sexual assault occurs every 68 seconds. One in every five American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape. From 2009-13, US Child Protective Services agencies found strong evidence indicating that 63,000 children per year were victims of sexual abuse.These developments reflect a troubling pattern. There is evidence from Donald Trump’s first term that there could be further erosion of women’s rights in his second presidency. During his previous term there were significant attempts to weaken healthcare access, with his foreign policy reinstating the “global gag rule” restricting access to women’s reproductive healthcare worldwide via funding conditions.Fragility of women’s rightsIf the world can tolerate the Taliban’s abuses, Iraq’s restrictive laws and the US restrictions on abortion access, it reveals the fragility of women’s and girls’ rights globally, and how easy it is to take them away.The UN agency, UN Women, says it could take another 286 years to close the global gender gaps in legal protections. No country has yet achieved gender equality, based on the gender pay gap, legal equality and social inequality levels. Women and girls continue to face discrimination in all corners of the world, and it seems to be getting worse. But despite everything women continue to resist.—The ConversationRead the original article here. \nThe inauguration of an immigration office at Korala border point in Upper Mustang’s Lo Manthang on October 30 had given a message of improved connectivity with the northern neighbour. But the excitement didn’t last as the office, opened with fanfare, was closed without delivering service for a single day. While unveiling the commemorative plaque, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak was flanked by a group of high profile officials. Gandaki Province Chief Minister Surendra Raj Pandey, heads of three security agencies, director general of the immigration department, among others, landed at Lo Manthang to attend the function. No sooner had the VIPs returned to Kathmandu, other officials deployed there also decamped as Tihar festival began the next day. But they didn’t go back even after the end of the festivities citing the biting cold of the high mountain. Nepal has kept the border facility closed since the inauguration citing severe cold. This is a lame excuse. The weather didn’t suddenly turn cold there, nor has the situation on the ground worsened due to a natural disaster or other unforeseen events. Everyone knew that Korala border point, which is situated at an altitude of 4,650 metres, would witness a freezing cold in the winter. The authorities should have prepared before the inauguration. By contrast, the offices on the Chinese side are operating just fine.Bringing the immigration and other offices into operation at Lo Manthang is important as the Korala border point not only connects Nepal and China but also has a potential to be a trilateral trade junction between Nepal, India and China. Nepal has been building the Kaligandaki Corridor national pride project that connects the Siddhartha Highway in the south to Korala in the north. When the road is complete, the route from Nepal-India border point at Sunauli to Nepal-China border point at Korala through Siddhartha Highway and Kaligandaki corridor can be an alternative trilateral trade route linking the three countries. While important religious destinations such as Lumbini and Muktinath are on the route, it also connects Nepal’s important cities including Pokhara and Chitwan.Failure to bring this border point into operation has multiple effects. First, it undermines the route’s huge potential. Second, it leaves a bad impression on the Chinese. Indian, Chinese, and other countries that have been supporting us have a serious concern about Nepal’s negligence in development works. We sign agreements or inaugurate projects with a lot of noise, but don’t work on their maintenance or sustainability.Closure of Korala immigration is a case in point. Several projects started with Indian support have met with similar fate. India’s railway company constructed the Kurta-Bijalpura rail section and handed over the rail line to the Nepal Railway Company Limited last year. It has since been helping operate the train as Nepal is still to train its own staff to run the train.As Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli works on a wish list to be presented before Chinese leaders during his Beijing visit in the first week of December, such failure in bilateral initiatives weaken Nepal’s position. When Nepal seeks other countries’ support in its development endeavours, it must at least be ready to shoulder its share of responsibility. India and China have shown ability in infrastructure development, both at home and abroad. By failing to do even the bare minimum to take them into confidence, Nepal is severely undercutting its development prospects.  \nTaragaon Regency Hotels Limited, operating under the international chain Hyatt in Boudha, Kathmandu, has been recognised as the highest taxpayer in the tourism sector for the fiscal year 2023/24 by the Inland Revenue Department.The hotel has previously been recognised multiple times as the top tax-paying company in the tourism sector in fiscal years 2014/15, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20.Additionally, the government of Nepal recognised the hotel in 2019 for contributing the highest amount of foreign currency earnings in the tourism sector.According to Corporate President Rani Bang, the hotel with 303 rooms, provides direct employment to approximately 325 people.“The hotel has been significantly contributing to Nepal’s tourism industry for over two decades by attracting high-end tourists, reflecting Nepali art and style,” she said.  \nNorthvolt, the Swedish maker of battery cells for electric vehicles, said on Thursday it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US, dealing a blow to Europe’s hopes that its most developed battery player would reduce Western car makers’ reliance on Chinese rivals.Northvolt said it has only enough cash to support operations for about a week and said it has secured $100 million in new financing for the bankruptcy process. It said operations will continue as normal during the bankruptcy.“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition, filed in US Bankruptcy Court in Houston. The company, which has operations in California, has about $30 million of cash, which can support its operations for only about a week. It has $5.8 billion in debts.Northvolt, which employs around 6,600 staff across seven countries, said it expects to complete the restructuring by the first quarter of 2025.Northvolt transformed in a matter of months from Europe’s best shot at a homegrown electric-vehicle battery champion to a company struggling to stay afloat by slimming down, hobbled by production problems, the loss of a major customer and a lack of funding.Europe has been hoping that Northvolt would reduce Western car makers’ reliance on Chinese rivals such as battery maker CATL, and EV and battery maker BYD.Northvolt said the $100 million in a new loan is part of $245 million in financing support for the bankruptcy. Swedish truck maker Scania, a shareholder and its biggest customer said on Thursday that it was loaning $100 million to Northvolt to support the manufacturing of electric vehicle battery cells in Skellefteå, northern Sweden.“This decisive step will allow Northvolt to continue its mission to establish a homegrown, European industrial base for battery production,” Tom Johnstone, interim chairman of Northvolt’s board, said in a statement, noting the support Northvolt has received from existing lenders and customers.As part of the restructuring, Northvolt will evaluate proposals for new money investment from strategic and financial investors, as well as existing lenders, shareholders and customers, he said.Volkswagen, Northvolt’s top shareholder with a 21% stake, said it had taken note of the filing and was in close contact with the Swedish firm. It declined to comment on potential repercussions on its own business.STIFF COMPETITIONInvestment group Vargas, a co-founder of Northvolt and one of its largest shareholders, said the bankruptcy would allow the company to address financial challenges and maintain its competitive edge in producing high-performance battery cells.Handelsbanken analyst Hampus Engellau said the bankruptcy filing would give the company some short-term breathing space. Even so, he said, “This tells us that they haven’t found investors and raised the capital needed to restructure their business.”Northvolt had been discussing the possibility of filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States as one of several options for survival, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.Northvolt has led a wave of European startups investing tens of billions of dollars in battery production to serve the continent’s automakers as they switch from internal-combustion engines to EVs.But EV demand is growing at a slower pace than some in the industry had projected, and competition remains stiff from China, which controls 85% of global battery-cell production, according to International Energy Agency data.At a court hearing late Thursday, US Bankruptcy Judge Alfredo Perez approved some routine initial steps in Northvolt’s bankruptcy, including allowing the company to pay wages owed to employees and draw the first $51 million of the Scania loan.On Monday, Reuters reported that Northvolt had missed some in-house targets and curtailed production at its battery-cell plant in Skellefteå, underscoring the challenge of ramping up output.The company’s court filing on Thursday said it had capacity to produce 300,000 batteries a year.In October, Northvolt struck a deal that gave access to a small amount of money while talks on a bigger financing package continued, Business Daily DI reported.Those talks had become more difficult in recent weeks, one of the sources familiar with the Chapter 11 plan said.In recent years several Swedish companies have opted for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filings, such as Scandinavian airline SAS and debt collector Intrum, a process that allows management to retain control over the company and run operations.Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch said on social media platform X that the government continues to support the EV battery industry and hopes that the restructuring will help turn around Northvolt’s fortunes. Busch told Reuters on Tuesday that the Swedish government had no plans to take a stake in Northvolt. \nOn Friday the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas and mainly fair in the rest of the country.One or two places of the hilly region of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki and Karnali Province are likely to experience light rain. The Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast chances of light snowfall at one or two places of the high hilly and mountainous region of the country.Tonight the weather will remain partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki and Karnali Province and mainly fair in the rest of the country.On Thursday, Janakpur experienced a maximum temperature of 32.2°C, while Jumla experienced a minimum temperature of -2.8°C. Kathmandu reported a maximum temperature of 21.3°C, with a minimum of 9°C. \n\nA total of 47 Nepalis deported from Russia and Bulgaria have arrived home. Russia repatriated 29 individuals for not attending regular university classes and working without permits, while Bulgaria sent back 18 Nepalis who were victims of human trafficking, officials said.Russian authorities arrested 34 Nepalis on October 30 from a call centre in Moscow’s Kuzminki area. The following day, a local court approved their deportation. Twenty-nine of them were sent to Nepal on Monday night via an Air Arabia flight and arrived in Kathmandu on Tuesday evening. The remaining five are still undergoing deportation processes.Many of the deported students said education consultancies had misled them about opportunities in Russia. One student said, “We were told we could study and work without restrictions, but that was untrue. Living in Russia without work was impossible, and we were arrested while working.” Before deportation, they were held at a detention centre in Sakharovo, 60 km from Moscow.Most of them had gone to Russia two years ago.An immigration officer at the Tribhuvan International Airport said they didn’t investigate further. “We did not find it necessary to take them into custody for further statements,” said an immigration officer. “All of them were released through standard procedures.”The returning students said they would discuss whether to file complaints against the education consultancies. “We are all under mental stress right now,” one student said. “We will discuss what steps to take to prevent other students from being exploited like us.”Keshav Timilsina, president of the Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) Russia, said the lack of proper documentation prevented them from receiving legal support.“If dissatisfied with the court’s decision, an appeal can be filed,” he said. “Relatives and friends of the detained students had contacted the NRNA for assistance. We were prepared to hire a lawyer to pursue legal remedies, but they could not provide documents such as contracts with the employer or proof of university attendance. Without these papers, the plan to appeal was cancelled.”Sushil Ghimire, Nepal’s acting ambassador to Russia, said the embassy could not assist as the students had violated local laws. “Russian law mandates attendance for students, but most were working instead. Violating labour laws left us with no legal grounds to support them,” he said.Timilsina said that most students who travelled to Russia through consultancies, except those on government scholarships, have faced such issues. “Russia provides scholarships to 200 Nepali students annually, and those receiving scholarships do not incur any expenses,” he said. “Russia is a destination for studying only through government educational scholarships. It is impossible to work while studying, as some consultancies claim.”Meanwhile, Bulgaria deported 18 Nepalis who were trafficked via India, Romania, and Hungary. They lacked proper entry documents and were detained for three months in a deportation centre in Sofia. The Nepalis were sent back to Nepal on government-sponsored tickets, arriving in Kathmandu last Thursday.The Nepali embassy in Germany, which oversees consular services for Bulgaria, said the deported individuals had been arrested for lacking official documents. \nAt least 38 people were killed in a gun attack carried out on passenger vans in the lower Kurram area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Thursday, according to the police.Ahmady Shama Station House Officer Kaleem Shah told Dawn.com that 38 people were killed, including three women, and 11 were injured.Earlier, Tehsil Head Quarters (THQ) Hospital Alizai Medical Superintendent Dr Muhammad Ishaq said 33 people were killed and 30 injured, adding that the latter were being referred to various hospitals in the district and some to Peshawar.KP Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry told Reuters that “the death toll is likely to rise”.President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the incident and expressed his condolences to the bereaved of the deceased.“Attacking innocent passengers is a cowardly and inhumane act,” he was quoted as saying in a post on X by PPP’s media cell.He added that those responsible for the incident should be punished. He urged that timely medical aid be provided to the injured.KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur took strict notice of the incident and also condemned it.He directed a delegation comprising the chief secretary, provincial law minister and the area’s MNA and MPA to visit Kurram immediately.The incident comes amid a sharp uptick in the number of terrorist attacks in Balochistan and KP.Attacks escalated after the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan outfit broke a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022 and vowed to target security forces.Last month, two terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation in KP’s North Waziristan district.Twelve security personnel were martyred after a checkpost was targeted in the Mali Khel area of KP’s Bannu, the military’s media affairs wing said a day ago.- In association with Asia News Network \nNepal has received a sovereign credit rating of ‘BB Minus’ from the international agency Fitch Ratings. While this rating places Nepal one level below India, it remains higher than that of other South Asian nations.The rating reflects Nepal’s strong foreign currency reserves and indications of revitalised economic activity, which are expected to contribute to positive economic growth in the country.Fitch Ratings conducted an on-site assessment in September before releasing its findings. While not an exceptional rating, experts highlight that it is neither poor. Generally, countries rated above ‘BB Minus’ are considered favourable for investment. Ratings below this fall under the speculative grade, with lower tiers indicating higher risks or potential insolvency. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel has conferred the honorary rank of General of the Nepali Army on General Upendra Dwivedi, chief of the army staff (COAS) of India.He was presented a sword and a scroll at a special ceremony organised at the Office of President Sheetal Niwas on Thursday. Vice President Ramsahay Prasad Yadav, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Defence Minister Manbir Rai, among other top officials attended the function, according to the Office of the President.Nepal and India have given continuity to the tradition of conferring army chiefs of each other’s country with the honorary title for the past over seven decades.General Dwivedi, who arrived in Kathmandu on Wednesday on a five-day official visit, will hold other meetings, besides receiving the honorary rank. The five-member delegation, led by him, also includes Sunita Dwivedi, chair of the Army Wives Welfare Association of the Indian Army. According to the Ministry of Defence of India, Dwivedi is scheduled to address the student officers of Nepali Army Command and Staff Course, Shivapuri on Friday. During the day, General Dwivedi will call on Prime Minister Oli and Defence Minister Manbir Rai and engage in talks on issues of mutual interests, the ministry said in a press release issued on Wednesday.On Saturday, Dwivedi will attend an ex-servicemen’s rally at Pokhara, wherein the COAS will felicitate Veer Naris and Gallantry Awardees and he will also interact with the Indian Army veterans. “The COAS will visit Western Division HQ, Nepali Army and will be briefed in presence of General Officer Commanding, Western Division, Nepali Army,” it said.Ahead of his visit, Amrit Mohan Prasad, director general of India’s Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), visited Nepal to attend the eighth annual coordination meeting between SSB and Nepal’s Armed Police Force. During the two-day meeting that concluded on Monday, the two sides expressed concerns over the movement of third-country nationals through the Nepal-India border. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nThomas Bell is a man of few words. When we decided to meet at Cafe Cheeno in Patandhoka following the launch of his book, ‘Human Nature’, I expected our conversation to last for an hour, but we were done within twenty minutes. Bell studied at the University of Oxford and the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. Fresh from graduation, he came to Kathmandu for the first time in 2002 as an international correspondent to cover the ongoing civil war. He ended up staying longer than he would have imagined—eighteen years. His books, ‘Kathmandu’ (2014) and ‘Human Nature’ (2024), result from his in-depth reporting, travels and research on Nepal and the Nepali people.Currently living in the UK, Bell, a former South East Asia correspondent for the UK Daily Telegraph, is more inclined towards books than journalism. In this chat with the Post’s Anish Ghimire, Bell discusses coming to Nepal, the state of contemporary journalism and his new book ‘Human Nature’.Have you always wanted to be a journalist? Not exactly. After I finished university, I began looking around, thinking about what I should do, and journalism seemed like it would combine a few things I was interested in: politics, travel, and writing. So it was a choice I made later.What made you come to Nepal during a difficult period and write ‘Kathmandu’?Well, I came here because it was a difficult period. I had recently graduated in history and wanted to be a foreign correspondent. So, I looked around, considered a few options, and chose Nepal. It felt like the right option because of what was happening in the country. Right after the royal massacre, the Maoists were making progress in the countryside, and the world was paying attention to Nepal. It seemed like a nice place to travel around as well. The country grew on me, and I ended up staying for about eighteen years.How did your time in Nepal shape your understanding of the complex relationship between the country’s history, culture and politics? I was primed to think about those relationships because of what I studied at the university. Alongside a degree in history, I also acquired another degree in architectural history. So, writing about it came naturally. Plus, I was interested in learning about the country’s culture, politics, and architecture. I dug deeper to write about how the streets, the squares, the chowks, and the buildings worked together.I have done something similar with the new book, ‘Human Nature’, but instead of built-in environments, it’s about the hills, mountains, forests, and rivers. You’ve been in journalism for a long time, having worked for the Economist and The Daily Telegraph. How has journalism changed since you arrived in Nepal for the first time? Journalism around the world has changed a lot. Today, there is a lot less money in it. When I started, Nepal was going through a difficult period, and there were plenty of stories to report. A young man like me could make a decent living abroad because newspapers paid my freelance work a modest amount.However, that is not the case anymore because of industry changes and the emergence of the internet. The media worldwide lacks resources, and people get their news by other means. Another big difference is when I first came here, a few Nepali journalists reported in English for foreign media. Now, that space is filled up by many local reporters who can do much better than an outsider. So, that’s good progress.Some of the changes in the industry brought about by the internet have also affected the domestic media landscape here. Newspapers are struggling for business. For the last few days, I have been trying to find newspapers in the market; there weren’t many shops selling them.Your new book, ‘Human Nature’, explores Nepal’s history. What aspect of the country do you believe is most misunderstood?This book looks at Nepal’s history but from a particular lens—in terms of the relationships between society, culture, and the environment. So, it’s kind of an environmental history. Something that might be new to the readers is the discussion of the role of agriculture.Prithvi Narayan Shah is celebrated as a military and political genius who rose from the micro-kingdom of Gorkha to unify Nepal. By his death in 1775, he had conquered the Kathmandu Valley and established it as his capital. He laid the foundation for the Gorkhali Empire, which briefly spanned the Himalayas from Sikkim to Punjab. His success is often attributed to his strategic brilliance and patriotic vision, portraying him as a unifier of a fragmented land. A key aspect of his strategy was rewarding soldiers with land, creating a land-military system that fueled his empire’s expansion. However, this narrative is intertwined with a more profound history: the rise of agriculture, particularly rice farming. Rice cultivation had been spreading eastward in Nepal long before King Shah’s time, fostering the growth of small kingdoms. Unlike foraging or pastoralism, rice farming produced surplus food, which brought about taxation and the establishment of villages, kings, laws, and temples. This agricultural transformation necessitated greater social and military organisation, creating the conditions for unification. King Shah and his successors finalised this process, consolidating the numerous ‘rice kingdoms’ into a single nation, completing a centuries-long evolution of agrarian society into a centralised state.How similar or different is writing a piece and writing a book?I don’t do much journalism these days. The only writing I do is for my books, which come out occasionally. But yeah, the writing process is very different. Writing a short piece is merely a thousand words, whereas a book is about eighty thousand words. The difference is like running a marathon and a sprint, I guess.

The committee was established following the issuance of the special structures operation and management development committee (formation order), published in the Nepal Gazette on November 18.The listed structures include the International Convention Centre in New Baneshwar, Kathmandu, which currently houses the Federal Parliament; the Sunrise Hall in Godavari, Lalitpur; the Butwal International Convention and Exhibition Centre in Rupandehi; the Dharahara in Kathmandu; and the Damak View Tower in Jhapa.The committee will oversee the operation of these facilities, including Dharahara, despite prior recommendations suggesting its management be handed over to local government for long-term operation.Earlier, a study team led by Senior Divisional Engineer Lila Khatri from the Urban Development and Building Construction Department submitted a report on August 18 recommending Dharahara’s operation under Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). However, the federal government opted to retain control under the Urban Development Ministry, potentially triggering tensions between the KMC and the central government.The newly issued order also dissolved the International Convention Centre Development Committee, which was in operation since 1994. According to the directive, management of the facilities will now fall under an executive director appointed through open competition.The Development Committee’s central office will be located in Kathmandu, with provisions to establish branch offices near other listed structures as necessary.While the Damak View Tower, strongly promoted by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, remains incomplete and non-operational, the government has listed it among the special structures.Dharahara, previously managed by the KMC since 1998, was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake and rebuilt under the National Reconstruction Authority. \nCandidates for mayor in Kirtipur Municipality, where a by-election is being held on December 1, have started their election campaign. In the race are a total of 20 candidates—nine from various political parties and 11 independents.In the 2022 local elections, independent candidates presented a formidable challenge to political party candidates in various local units. Independent candidates won mayorships in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, the Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City and the Dhangadhi Municipality. Will the outcome in Kirtipur be different this time, or will the traditional parties prevail? The by-election comes after the death of Rajkumar Nakarmi, former Mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, who died in July due to kidney failure. He had won on a Nepali Congress ticket.Major political parties including the Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have fielded their candidates. But the fourth largest political party in the House of Representatives, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, did not field anyone reportedly after failing to find a suitable candidate.The candidates include Krishnaman Dangol from the Congress, Surendra Manandhar from the UML, and Shiva Sharan Maharjan from the Maoist Centre. Besides these, seventeen others, including 11 independents, have filed their nominations. Candidates from other parties include Dil Kumar Maharjan of the Nepal Samajbawadi Party, Shri Krishna Maharjan of the Nepal Majdoor Kishan Party, Dhurba Maharjan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, and Keshav Shrestha of the Janamat Party. Similarly, independent candidates include Navaraj Kumar Baniya, Rajman Manav, Ram Krishna Maharjan, Mim Maharjan, Prem Bahadur Maharjan, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari, Naresh Shrestha, Dharmaratna Manandhar, Ananda Maharjan, Nareshraj Pande, and Kabir Kumar Maharjan. In the 2022 local elections, the Congress candidate Nakarmi won the mayorship with 9,043 votes, while his closest competitor, Keshav Ratna Bajracharya of the UML, secured 5,507 votes. The Maoist Centre’s Shiva Saran Maharjan, who is contesting for the position in the by-election, had obtained 4,090 votes then. Of the total 31,112 registered voters, almost 14,000 live in the core area of Kirtipur, and the remaining 17,000 reside in the peripheral regions. The core area includes the municipality’s wards 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, including Tyanglaphat, whereas the peripheral areas include wards 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The core area is predominantly inhabited by the Newar community, while the peripheral region is more diverse with migrants in big numbers. Political leaders and analysts say that the peripheral region will be decisive in the election.But Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol disputes this claiming that the concept of peripheral region is a misrepresentation. “The area that some people call ‘peripheral’ is in fact the core of Kirtipur,” Dangol told the Post. “From Nagau, Panga, Bhajungle, to Chobhar all are part of Kirtipur’s core area.”UML candidate Surendra Manandhar agrees with Dangol and says dividing the local unit along community lines is not a good idea.Dangol, the Congress candidate, considers UML’s Manandhar his close competitor, but some local residents say the true challenge could come from the Maoist Centre’s Shiva Sharan Maharjan, who had a strong showing in the 2022 local election. “Majarjan already contested and did well. The UML’s Manandhar is new, therefore we believe there will be a tough competition between the Congress and the Maoist Centre,” said a local resident.The Maoist Centre has also forged an electoral alliance with the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Janata Samajbadi-Nepal, led by Upendra Yadav, to strengthen its bid.“I lost the previous election due to a technical mistake, but this time, we are confident of a win,” the Maoist Centre candidate Maharjan told the Post. He said his chances have improved due to the growing public disenchantment towards the current ruling Congress-UML coalition.But UML’s Manandhar appears unbothered by the competition. He said he is better prepared than others and is confident of a win.For the Congress, the contest appears more difficult as former Congress party members are running as independents. Kabir Kumar Maharjan and Dinesh Kumar Adhikari, who were previously with the Congress, are among the independent candidates.“The situation of Congress is different. For other parties, winning adds a seat, but losing doesn’t make much difference because they hadn’t won this seat in the previous election,” Himal Karki, a local Congress leader, told the Post. “But, for Congress, there’s a pressure to win because this is a seat our party earlier won.”An overwhelming presence of independent candidates makes the contest more complex for Congress, as local figures who have established their own identity in Kirtipur, such as Rajman Manav, are getting considerable voter attention.Harka Sampang, the independent mayor of Dharan Sub-metropolitan City, has also expressed his support for Manav. Sampang is set to join Manav’s election campaign starting from November 23.“Harka Sampang will be in Kirtipur for my election campaign,” Manav told the Post.Congress candidate Dangol, meanwhile, does not consider Manav as a competitor. He claimed that Manav is a former UML cadre and quit the party to focus on social activities, especially sanitation campaigns. “So Manav could draw UML votes, not ours,” Dangol said.Meanwhile, Suresh Maharjan, a Kirtipur resident who identifies himself as a Maoist Centre sympathiser, says the votes garnered by independent candidates will determine the election’s outcome.  \nPolice in Kathmandu have now started investigation against Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, former deputy inspector general (DIG) of Nepal Police Chhabi Lal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel on the charge of diverting funds from cooperatives to Gorkha Media Network when they were holding key positions in the media company.The Kathmandu District Court on Sunday permitted the police to arrest former home minister Lamichhane and former DIG Joshi to investigate the charges of misusing deposits of Swarnalakshmi Savings Cooperative in Kalimati, Kathmandu. Earlier, the court had also authorised the arrest of 24 others, including Gorkha Media chair Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, in relation to the same case.Lamichhane, Joshi and Ramtel have already been arrested and are being interrogated in Kaski and Rupandehi districts over the misuse of cooperative funds. With this, the police are now simultaneously investigating them in the three districts of Kathmandu, Kaski and Rupandehi.The trio is accused of diverting tens of millions of rupees from Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperative and Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative to Gorkha Media Network that operated the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television. Rai and Lamichhane were chairman and managing director of the media company respectively. Joshi and Ramtel were also board members.Lamichhane quit media to join politics in June, 2022.Ramtel, implicated in the Swarnalaxmi Cooperative fraud case, was brought from Pokhara to Kathmandu for further interrogation on November 16. After completing Ramtel’s interrogation, police now plan to bring Lamichhane and Joshi, who are in police custody in Pokhara, to Kathmandu. A police officer said they will be brought to Kathmandu to be interrogated over the misappropriation of money from Swarnalaxmi Cooperative. Lamichhane, Joshi and Ramtel were also taken to Rupandehi for interrogation and brought back to Kaski last week.Ramtel, the treasurer of Surya Darshan Cooperative in Pokhara, was arrested on September 11 and held in Pokhara before he was brought to Kathmandu in a separate cooperative fraud investigation. A police officer privy to the development said that after Ramtel’s interrogation in Kathmandu, he was sent to Pokhara on Sunday night. However, Nawaraj Adhikari, the spokesperson of the Kathmandu Police Range, refused to divulge when Lamichhane and Joshi will also be brought to Kathmandu from Pokhara. He also declined to give more details on Ramtel’s interrogation. The Swarnalaxmi Cooperative fraud case began with complaints filed at the Kalimati Police Circle and involved 24 suspects, including the cooperative’s chairman GB Rai, and Ramtel, the treasurer. Police estimate a misappropriation of Rs1.11 billion, affecting 645 depositors.While the trio is under police remand, Rai is on the run. Despite a Interpol red notice against him, his whereabouts are still unknown. Based on the complaint filed by the victim to the Kathmandu Metropolitan City and the police, along with the report of the Parliamentary Special Investigation Committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives, the police were granted permission by the court to arrest 24 people accused in the case in the Swarnalaxmi Cooperative fraud case. The Gorkha Media Network leadership reportedly misappropriated funds of Swarnalaxmi, Suryadarshan, Supreme and some other cooperatives across the country. Joshi was arrested from Kathmandu on September 22 and Lamichhane on October 18 and both were taken to Pokhara. Earlier in September, the parliamentary special probe, in its report submitted to Speaker Devraj Ghimire, recommended prosecuting four individuals, including Lamichhane, the then managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Rai; board member Ramtel; and initial founder Joshi. Following Lamichhane’s arrest, the RSP has been staging street protests since October 19, saying the arrest is politically motivated. \nDaman Nath Dhungana, the first Speaker after the restoration of democracy in 1990, and a human rights defender who always stood for justice for anti-establishment forces passed away on Sunday. He was 83.Dhungana, who was suffering from a chronic liver problem, was rushed to the Baneshwar-based Frontline Hospital after he experienced breathing problems on Sunday. Doctors pronounced him dead upon arrival at the hospital.Dhungana was born in January 1942 in Kathmandu.Throughout his life, Dhungana maintained a distinct identity in Nepal’s political movements. Despite being affiliated to the Nepali Congress for a long time, he didn’t confine himself within the party’s domain. He earned immense respect from other political parties and communities fighting for their rights and identity.He joined politics as a student activist from the beginning of the Panchayat period in the 1960s and later established himself as an advocate, human rights activist, civil society leader, and politician. He became general secretary of the Nepal Bar Association in 1971. Dhungana was also a founder executive member of Amnesty International. In 1990 he served as a member of the Constitution Recommendation Commission that drafted Nepal’s constitution.Dhungana spent five years in jail during different periods under the Panchayat regime for supporting political parties that were banned at the time for opposing the system. He fought against the Panchayat system and for the restoration of democracy after King Mahendra abolished the parliamentary system and imposed the partyless Panchayat system in 1960, says Congress leader Arjun Narashinga KC.“Dhungana was an intellectually towering figure who made a huge contribution to Nepali society,” former minister KC said.Those who remember Dhungana say that his legacy cannot be captured through a single lens since he had multiple identities.Raghuji Pant of the CPN-UML remembers Dhungana as a lawyer who advocated for democratic rights during the Panchayat regime. Later, Dhungana got elected as a member of parliament from Kathmandu-2 on a ticket of the Nepali Congress, which also won a majority in the 205-seat House of Representatives during the 1992 parliamentary polls, the first general election conducted after the restoration of democracy in 1990. As the only Congress candidate to be elected from Kathmandu and his background as an advocate and former general secretary of Nepal Bar Association made him an ideal choice for the role of Speaker. Dhungana thus became the first Speaker after the restoration of the democracy, and the second in overall parliamentary history of Nepal. Congress leader Krishna Parsad Bhattarai is the first Speaker in Nepal’s history as he was Speaker of the first parliament elected in 1959.“However, Dhungana was someone who set a benchmark for Speakers in Nepal and someone who could be consulted on Parliamentary affairs,” lawmaker Pant told the Post. “Despite being from the rival political party, we alway respected him.”For Pant, a phrase coined by Dhungana in the parliamentary history of Nepal is something to be cherished which is, “Parliament always belongs to the opposition party while the government is led by the ruling party.”Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who closely followed parliamentary affairs, believed that Dhungana’s approach to give the opposition party more space in the House made him a leader respected by all.Thapa also says that there was a time when the Congress, the party that appointed him as Speaker, was unhappy with him for giving more space to the opposition.Dhungana could not complete his term as Speaker after Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala dissolved the House and announced midterm elections in 1994 due to intra-party feud within the Congress party.Dhungana wasn’t quite active as a party leader after the mid-term election of 1994. However, he played a key role as a civil society leader in the people’s movement in 2006. Dhungana also played an active role in facilitating negotiations between the government agencies and mainstream political parties with the erstwhile rebel Maoists. He was one of the key mediators while signing important agreements between mainstream political forces and Maoists. In 2017, after a 23-year gap from active party politics, Dhungana contested the parliamentary election from Bhaktapur-2 on a Congress ticket, but did not win.In an interview with The Kathmandu Post in August last year, Dhungana had said that Nepalis brought about radical political changes but didn’t learn how to run the democracy responsibly. “As successive governments have failed to deliver, those who want to undo recent political changes are emboldened,” he said in the interview. “A section of the intelligentsia also backs the idea. This is how multiple complications are emerging.”Dhungana is survived by his wife Bhuwan Koirala, two sons, and a daughter. According to family sources, he will be cremated on Monday after one of the sons Nimesh Dhungana who is in Britain returns. His other son Nishesh and daughter Nikita are in Nepal.Tributes pour inTop politicians, members of the intelligentsia and rights activists, among others, have paid tributes to Dhungana and expressed condolences to the bereaved family members.President Ramchandra Paudel said he was shocked by the news of Dhungana’s death. “The contribution made by Dhungana to the democratic movement as a politician, senior advocate and a civil society leader will always be remembered,” the Office of the President wrote on social media platform X on Sunday.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli expressed his sadness and wrote on Facebook: “I recall his remarkable contribution to the human rights movement and promotion of parliamentary democracy in Nepal.”Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel said “Dhungana’s death caused irreparable loss to the country’s democratic movement.”Akhilesh Upadhyay, former editor-in-chief of The Kathmandu Post, remembers Dhungana as arguably Nepal's best Speaker to date.“Much respected by the opposition- UML, NWPP, Sadhavana, etc. But Nepali Congress heavyweight and then-prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala disliked him; Dhungana refused to entertain GPK's partisan interests,” Upadhyay wrote on X. “History will be kinder. RIP.” \nA total of 410 candidates have registered their nominations for 44 positions in Nepal’s upcoming local by-elections, scheduled for December 1, according to the Election Commission.Of the nominees, 342 are men, 66 women, and two belong to other categories. Notably, two women are competing for the role of chief of the Kailali District Coordination Committee, while Nepali Congress candidate Tek Raj Bhattarai is the sole nominee for the same position in Okhaldhunga district.For the eight posts of rural municipality chairperson and deputy chairperson, as well as municipality mayor and deputy mayor, 84 candidates have filed nominations, including 35 women and 48 men.Similarly, for the 34 vacant ward chair positions in municipalities and rural municipalities, 323 candidates have been nominated–29 women, 293 men, and one other candidate, stated Election Commission Spokesperson Nita Pokharel Aryal.The by-elections will see participation from 25 political parties, including the fourth-largest party in the parliament, Rastriya Swatantra Party, which emerged after the 2022 local elections. Citizens will elect representatives for two district coordination committee chiefs, two rural municipality chairpersons, four vice-chairs, one mayor, one deputy mayor, and 34 ward chairpersons. The vacancies arise as these positions, originally filled during the 2022 elections, have not yet completed their full terms.The Election Commission has enforced a code of conduct starting from the nomination day. This includes prohibitions on symbolic materials such as jackets, caps, and stickers bearing party symbols, and restrictions on election rallies to ensure a disciplined and civilised process. Political parties have been urged to adhere to these rules, with campaigns restricted to official online platforms for sharing their principles and commitments.The commission has also imposed spending limits for candidates. Mayoral and deputy mayoral candidates can spend up to Rs450,000, rural municipality chairs and vice-chairs up to Rs350,000, and ward chair aspirants for rural municipalities up to Rs150,000. In a notable decision, only women candidates are allowed for the four vacant vice-chair positions, aiming to promote gender inclusivity.The final list of candidates and their poll symbols will be published after any objections and withdrawals are resolved. As the by-elections approach, the spotlight remains on how political parties and candidates navigate these regulations while engaging with voters. \nOne person was killed and five others injured in a tractor accident in Bhaktapur on Saturday.The incident occurred when the tractor lost control and overturned while travelling to Dekochha from Changunarayan.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Dhundiraj Neupane of the District Police Office, Bhaktapur, 45-year-old Hari Govinda Suwal from Changunarayan Municipality-5 succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital. Four others—35-year-old Radhika Awal, 60-year-old Gopal Koju, 44-year-old Radheshyam Sitikhu, and 74-year-old Purnakesi Shilpakar—suffered minor injuries and were discharged after receiving treatment at the hospital.The 48-year-old driver, Ganesh Suwal, from Bhaktapur Municipality-2, is currently undergoing treatment at the hospital. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nTen people were injured in a bus accident at Ghumaune in Kharipati of Bhaktapur district on Tuesday. Two are reportedly in critical condition.According to Pradeep Khatri, a traffic police inspector and chief of the District Traffic Police Range, the bus coming from Talakot of Changunarayan Municipality lost its control and hit a pole. The injured are undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital, police said. \nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nWhen Tanahun’s headquarters shifted to Damauli from Bandipur in November 1968, hordes of traders from Bandipur left for key cities like Chitwan, Damauli, Kathmandu, and Pokhara. The identity of Bandipur was at risk when the traders, along with the district headquarters, shifted.However, Bandipur has changed its identity due to the role of locals in cultural heritage conservation through community participation.Bikram Piya, a 55-year-old local, said that after the construction of the Prithvi Highway, if the headquarters had remained in Bandipur, people residing in the western part of Tanahun would be greatly inconvenienced in accessing government services.  “Therefore, Damauli is perfect for the district headquarters from the accessibility point of view.”Bandipur's history, a hilltop settlement 143 km west of Kathmandu and 80 km east of Pokhara, began in the 19th century when Newars from Bhaktapur arrived.Before that, it was inhabited mainly by Magars. After Prithvi Narayan Shah conquered Kathmandu Valley, the Newar merchants chose Bandipur as a trade route between India and Tibet. The merchants built their houses so as to reflect their style, architecture, and culture. Thus, the houses consist of pagoda-style roofs, lattice windows, and ornate doorways.Today, it is one of the most famous tourist destinations of Nepal. “The living culture, structure and natural beauty are the defining features of Bandipur,” said Piya.The Magars used to live in Bandipur and gave the place its name. In the Magar language, ‘Ban’ means forest, ‘Di’ means water, and ‘Pur’ means place. Civilisations have relied on forests and water since ancient times.According to old local documents, first Piya, then Pradhan, Shrestha, and Joshi settled here, and then other Newar types came.Bikram, a ninth-generation settler, says: “Bandipur is a living museum of Newari art and culture.”“Bandipur sits in the best of nature. It is also an appropriate place for business. That’s why it became a big draw for Newars from Bhaktapur,” said Chij Kumar Shrestha, an 80-year-old local. “Ancestors settled where there was water, land and jungle. Mine did the same too.”Trade was the major occupation of Newars. They supplied salt, edible oil, and other goods from Thori, Chitwan, on the Nepal-India border, and sold them in Bandipur Bazaar.Shrestha said that Bandipur developed as a trading point between the south and north. Goods imported from India used to be supplied to the hills and mountain areas like Tanahun, Kaski, Lamjung, and Gorkha, and goods brought from the hills and mountains would be supplied to the south from Bandipur.As highway expansion took place and traders started shifting to Chitwan, Kathmandu, Damauli, Pokhara, and Dumre, business activities in Bandipur started to slow down.“As young people moved away, the villages were left with old people. Even if tourists, by any chance, were found in Bandipur, they called it a ghost town,” said Sujan Shrestha, a 50-year-old local.Moved by the situation, people from Bandipur living in Kathmandu formed the Bandipur Social Development Committee in 1992. The committee's president, Sujan Shrestha, said the objective was to unite the people of Bandipur in tourism, education, and health.Sujan said Bandipur was promoted internationally because it represents different ethnicities' natural and cultural richness.“Foreign tourists started arriving, and homestays started to open,” said Sujan. “Training sessions on hospitability were provided on services ranging from tea brewing to homestay operations.” All types of vehicles started operating in Bandipur Bazaar in 1999. However, they were restricted due to the paving of market areas with stones.Bandipur is a destination preferred by those who want to escape crowds and pollution. A pleasant mountain range can be observed from the high hill of Bandipur, including the view of the rising and setting sun. A wide view of mountains is another feature of Bandipur.An open area stretches 3 km on the horizon, and hills can be observed from Tundikhel, a 10 minute walk from Bandipur.From top to bottom, mountain ranges like Langtang, Ganesh, Gorkha (Manaslu, Himchuli, and Boudha), Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchchhre, and Kanjirowa can be observed.A natural view tower, the land area near Marsyangdi River can also be observed from Bandipur.Developed as one of the outstanding tourism destinations of Gandaki province, Bandipur is also known as the ‘Queen of Hills.’ Located at a height of 1,317 metres, Bandipur is popular for its perfect view of mountain ranges and its cultural and religious significance. “Agro-eco tourism and adventure tourism is the big draw of Bandipur,” said Kishan Pradhan, president of the Bandipur Tourism Development Committee.Tourism activity, which has slowed down due to the devastating earthquake of 2015 and the Covid-19 pandemic, is gradually reviving.“The presence of domestic and international visitors is now good,” said Pradhan.Bipin Pradhan, a hotelier, said traditional art and culture, natural views, and a clean environment are the reasons why domestic and foreign tourists come.Siddha Cave in Bandipur, a rural municipality, is claimed to be Asia’s largest.Basanta Poudel, secretary of Bandipur Tourism Development Committee, said Bandipur is also an appropriate place for hiking.“Bhanjyang and resting area located at the height of 1,150 metres from sea level, paragliding from Gurungche Hill attracts tourists,” said Basanta.Around 90 big and small hotels and restaurants are operating in Bandipur, while four community homestays in the market area and 11 in the rural municipality are in operation.The hotel and homestay services in Bandipur can cater to 5,000 people.To increase tourists' stay, a mini great wall was constructed in 2019. The 6-km wall is being constructed from Thanimai temple to Mukundeshwari hill.The construction of the mini-great wall is expected to cost around Rs20 million.“The construction of structures like this can attract tourists,” said Surendra Bahadur Thapa, chairman of the rural municipality.Construction of projects like Thanimai temple, selfie garden, paragliding area, horse riding arena, Pushpalal memorial garden, Mukundeshwari garden, and a glass bridge is moving ahead. \nThe state-owned Dairy Development Corporation (DDC) and private dairies have been able to settle only half of the dues in the past one year as dairy demand remained subdued even during the festival season.Both private and state-run dairies were optimistic that the festivals in October and November would push up sales.Surya Prasad Paudel, general manager of the DDC, said there has been no improvement in sales even during festivals, which ended recently. “We gave festive sales targets to super markets like Bhatbhateni and Big Mart but those targets were not met.”Dairy farmers say out of an estimated Rs6 billion due to be paid by dairies, they are yet to receive Rs3 billion. “We had Rs1.58 billions in arrears to be paid to dairy farmers as of July. In the past four months, we cleared Rs1 billion in dues,” said Paudel. “We will gradually settle the remaining dues.”“We are focusing on product marketisation so that we can clear the remaining dues,” he said, adding that the DDC is planning to outsource private company to market and sell the stocks piling up.As sales did not improve, on September 27, the Public Debt Management Office loaned Rs600 million to the DDC.DDC exported 1,000 kilos of ghee to Japan last month. “We are expecting a monthly export of 5,000 kilos of ghee to Japan and making necessary preparations for that,” said Paudel.“A company has approached us to buy dairy products made from 10,000 litres of milk. We are in the agreement phase and discussing specifically on pricing.”Paudel did not reveal more but said the company exports goods to the US and other markets.DDC is planning to reduce the price of ghee targeting the consumer segment. “The decision on reviewing the price on ghee will be taken on Tuesday or Wednesday,” said Paudel.DDC buys milk worth around Rs200 million from farmers monthly.According to the corporation, it has 400 tonnes of skimmed powder milk and 400 tonnes of butter in stock.Since the corporation has to pay back the loan and clear the dues to dairy farmers and different parties, Paudel said it will take some measures to cut unnecessary expenditures.A committee was formed to recommend reforms and cost-cutting measures. “We have received the report and we are planning to implement it.”Private dairies claim to have settled all outstanding dues of the farmers.“We have cleared all the dues of farmers by taking loans from the bank. The festive demand increased the consumption of dairy products which also helped in clearing arrears of farmers,” said Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association.Earlier, the private dairies asked the government for loans by putting butter and powder milk stocks as collateral, but the government did not respond.The association had said that the private dairies had around Rs2 billion dues to be paid to the farmers a month and a half ago.According to the association, the private sector has 2,000 tonnes of unsold butter in stock. The sale of dairy products improved in the festive season sales but the off-season of dairy products has started, the private dairy entrepreneurs said.“We normally convert liquid milk into powder milk during March-April when the sales decline,” said Dahal.The association said that 3.2 million litres of milk arrives in the market daily, of which around 25 percent is held by the DDC and the remaining is purchased by private dairies.The daily milk purchases of the private dairies amount to around Rs100 million.“Out of the around Rs6 billion in arrears, both the government-owned DDC and private dairies have cleared around Rs3 billion till now,” said Amar Bahadur Kunwar, president of the Central Dairy Cooperative Association. The DDC has sent the dues amount to dairy farmers’ accounts. As the sales will decline from December to February, dairy farmers might not get their payment on time again.The output of dairy products like curd and ice cream declines in winter, increasing the stock of milk, which adds to the arrears, said Kunwar. The total arrears, including the old, may reach Rs5 billion in these three months, said Kunwar.Both state-owned and private dairies say that the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened the dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for nearly a year.Most of the farmers in eastern Tarai faced even more hardships as it has been nearly a year since they received any payments. \nAntimicrobial resistance is a common problem for most patients requiring intensive care in hospitals. What alarms doctors and experts is that the problem is not limited to patients with serious ailments but it also affects those seeking outpatient care.The irrational use of antimicrobials in humans, animals, and plants has led to a ‘silent pandemic’, and many people, including policymakers, have not taken the issue seriously.“Misuse, random use, and irrational use of antimicrobials, which can be purchased over-the-counter, has been leading to a serious crisis in our country,” said Dr Raju Pangeni, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Hams Hospital. “Most patients arrive at the hospital after using higher-grade antibiotics.”Experts warn that antimicrobials, which have saved millions of lives throughout the world, could soon become ineffective due to the high resistance rate caused by their irrational use.The World Health Organisation said antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites evolve over time and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death. As a result, medicines become ineffective and infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of their spread to others.Antibiotics, despite being prescription drugs, can be easily purchased over the counter in Nepal. Many people buy them without explaining their exact problems to pharmacists. And in many cases, pharmacists do not bother to inquire and fail to emphasise the importance of completing the prescribed course of medicine, which is among the main reasons for the growing rate of antimicrobial resistance, according to experts.Moreover, doctors usually prescribe antibiotics based on clinical diagnoses, even before receiving laboratory test reports. Experts say antibiotics do not work if the underlying infection is caused by a virus. According to experts, a patient’s sensitivity to antibiotics must be known before prescribing them, but very few doctors take the time to understand their patients' sensitivity to the drugs they prescribe. Patients are also unaware that the course of antibiotics must be completed and stopping them halfway could render the same antibiotic ineffective in the future. According to a 2021 study of the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC), only 32 percent of the doctors and health workers have access to laboratories for antibiotic susceptibility testing. Among them, only 49 percent recommend antibiotic susceptibility testing before prescribing antibiotics. This means that only 16 percent of doctors recommend antibiotics after conducting susceptibility testing.“There is a significant reason influencing rational prescriptions of antibiotics,” the report stated. The study also shows that more than one-third—37.8 percent—of prescribed medicines were antibiotics, which is higher than the World Health Organisation’s standards.The study shows about one-fourth (22 percent) of the outpatients did not consume a full course of antibiotics. Similarly, about 10 percent of outpatients consume antibiotics as prophylaxis while eight percent take double-dose antibiotics for a quick recovery. Around 22 percent of them save leftover antibiotics for the treatment of similar symptoms in the future. Additionally, around 28 percent of outpatients said they buy antibiotics without doctors’ or health workers’ prescriptions. While human antibiotic use contributes to antibiotic resistance, the widespread use of antibiotics in agricultural applications—most notably livestock and poultry production—is also a potential driver. Doctors say agricultural antibiotics contribute to the presence of resistant bacteria in meat and poultry products. Also, resistant organisms are released from farms into soil, groundwater, and surface waterways, leading to contamination of water sources used for crop irrigation and domestic purposes.The NHRC study showed around 70 percent of farmers used progressively higher doses of antibiotics and more frequently for faster recovery of sick animals or fowls. The study identified major shortcomings in the awareness and availability of national guidelines for prescribing antibiotics and infrastructures for recommending antibiotic susceptibility tests among human and animal health professionals. In a study of human, animal, and environmental samples carried out in the past, antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in 81 percent of the total samples on which antimicrobial resistance tests were carried out. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population says it requires an additional Rs400 million to continue the ‘safe motherhood programme’, which is credited with reducing maternal and neonatal mortality rates in the country.Officials say they plan to arrange Rs200 million through an internal loan within the ministry and ask the Ministry of Finance for another Rs200 million to continue the programme.“Around Rs2.5 billion a year is required to conduct the safe motherhood programme throughout the country,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We have informed the health ministry about the budget crunch.”The government’s Safe Motherhood programme is credited with saving hundreds of maternal and neonatal lives every year. In addition to free delivery services, the programme provides mothers and babies with free medical treatment, a transportation allowance, and cash incentives for antenatal checkups.Women in the mountainous, hilly and Tarai districts receive Rs3,000, Rs2,000 and Rs1,000, respectively. Additionally, a cash bonus of Rs800 is provided to mothers who complete all eight antenatal checkups. The institutional delivery rate, which was around 18 percent before 2009, when the government declared free institutional delivery services, has increased to 80 percent.“We have been collecting bills from hospitals providing safe motherhood services,” said Joshi. “As it is a national priority programme, we cannot discontinue the services. We will send invoices to the Health Ministry for reimbursement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office.Earlier, the country had cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.Fatality due to poor access to medical services during childbirth remains a leading cause of women’s death in Nepal.Data provided by the division show that at least 50 women from 51 districts succumbed due to complications during childbirth since the start of the current fiscal year. Division’s data show that at least 190 women from 51 districts died from complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024. In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Health officials concede that the actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in only 51 districts of 77 districts.According to the latest census report, 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the health ministry concede that the deaths reported from 51 districts represent only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths across the country.Lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths, and the budget shortfall is to blame for the inability to carry out maternal and perinatal death surveillance, officials say.Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention to improve maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.The World Health Organisation said maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal. \nIn a bid to tackle persistent malnutrition problems, the Food Management and Trading Company has started selling micronutrient-blended rice in various places across the country, including the Kathmandu Valley.Officials hope that various problems caused by micronutrient deficiencies will come down once people start eating the rice fortified with crucial minerals.The company has already been selling micronutrient-blended rice in Karnali Province for the past one year, as malnutrition is more severe in the region compared to other parts of the country.“One might assume residents of the Kathmandu Valley don’t need micronutrient-fortified foods. But even in the capital, many people suffer from health problems linked to deficiencies of crucial micronutrients, including vitamin B12,” said Ambika Paudel, manager at the Sales and Distribution Department of the company.Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which fell from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.Paudel informed that the company has blended iron, zinc, vitamin A, Vitamin B12, B1, B2, B6, and folic acid into rice, the country's staple food. Though only iron, zinc, vitamin A, folic acid, and vitamin B12 are mandatory, the company has been blending additional micronutrients, such as vitamins B1, B2, and B6 as well. Consumers have to pay an additional Rs5 per kilo for the fortified rice, which is blended in Kathmandu, Surkhet, Janakpur and Jajarkot.Officials say they have been selling blended rice at market price in all five districts of Karnali Province. Fortified rice is available in 25kg sacks at the company’s outlets.“We received a grant to sell micronutrient blended rice at market price in the districts of Karnali Province,” said Paudel. “We hope this initiative will help address malnutrition there.”Malnutrition plays a major role in the under-five mortality rate, according to the nutrition section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. Experts say malnutrition also hinders children’s mental development, and eventually affects the country’s economic health by weakening intellectual capacity, reducing productivity in adulthood, and increasing vulnerability to diseases.Although the 2022 survey showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province suffer from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or underweight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.The country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the existing 32 percent by 2030 in order to meet the SDG targets, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.“Various measures are being taken to address the improvement of the nutrition status,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Micronutrient fortification in rice is one among several measures being taken to tackle the existing malnutrition problem. We hope that this measure will be effective.” \nNo additional mutated poliovirus has been detected in sewage samples collected from Kathmandu, the National Public Health Laboratory that regularly carries out environmental surveillance of highly contagious disease said.Since the presence of type-3 poliovirus in sewage samples was confirmed in May, the central laboratory has stepped up environmental surveillance of the virus, which causes deformities and paralysis in children.“No additional muted poliovirus has been detected in the sewage samples collected from Kathmandu Valley and other places,” said Dr Ranjan Raj Bhatta, director of the laboratory.“The National Institute of Health of Thailand, the World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre, which carried out further testing on samples we sent, also confirmed that no additional poliovirus has been detected.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared free of the disease by the World Health Organisation only on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years. After having zero human cases of polio for about 14 years, the infectious disease surfaced in the capital city’s sewage in May.Type-3 polio virus, which is vaccine-derived, had been detected in sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers.Health authorities launched a mass polio vaccination drive in the three districts of the Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur—following the confirmation of the virus in the sewage samples to prevent the outbreak. All children under five years of age will be inoculated with an additional dose of oral polio vaccine in the drive.Officials at the laboratory said they have been conducting environmental surveillance on a regular basis and sending samples to the UN agency’s reference laboratory in Thailand for cell culture, as the service is available only in a few laboratories across the world.The national laboratory collects samples from five tributaries in the Kathmandu Valley and from Koshi, Madhesh, and Gandaki provinces to check for the presence of the polio virus. Doctors say the polio virus mainly affects children and is usually transmitted through droplets or aerosols from the throat and by faecal contamination of hands, utensils, food and water. Those who do not wash their hands properly, and those who consume contaminated food and water or reside in an area where water and sanitation conditions are poor are at high risk of getting infected with the virus.The Health Ministry said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 percent throughout the country.Childhood immunisation is the government’s number one priority, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has shown remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nBrazil drew 1-1 with Uruguay in South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday after Gerson’s brilliant strike cancelled out Federico Valverde's opener for the visitors.Five-time World Cup winners Brazil are fifth in the CONMEBOL standings on 18 points, one point behind Colombia and Ecuador, after picking up their second straight draw.Uruguay are second on 20 points, five behind leaders Argentina.The top six will automatically qualify for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.After a tight first half, Real Madrid midfielder Valverde opened the scoring in the 55th minute when he curled a fine long-range low shot into the far corner.Gerson brought the hosts level seven minutes later, the Flamengo midfielder scoring his first international goal with a terrific volley after a poor clearance by the Uruguayan defence.“I’d actually swap my goal for the win,” Gerson told Brazil’s Globo TV. “We knew it was a tough game and we wanted to win. We conceded the goal and got the equaliser.“We’ll just have to keep working at our clubs and next year when there's another international break we can go for it. We just have to keep working and trust in our work.”Brazil pushed for a winner but late efforts from Luis Enrique and Raphinha went wide as boos from home fans at the Arena Fonte Nove rang out at the final whistle.“I think the booing is more about the result, because in my opinion we gave it all,” Raphinha said.“I’m proud of those who played and even those on the bench. We did everything we could to get the result. We played a lot of football and we have to leave with our heads held high.” \nArgentina striker Lautaro Martinez scored in the second half to secure a 1-0 home win against Peru in South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday.Martinez scored 10 minutes after the break, capitalising on a fine cross from Lionel Messi to fire home a half-volley into the top-right corner.The Inter Milan striker’s 32nd international goal moved him level with Diego Maradona in fifth spot in the country’s all-time scoring charts.The World Cup holders lead the CONMEBOL standings with 25 points, five clear of Uruguay who play later in the day at Brazil. Peru are bottom of the 10-team table with seven points after 12 games.The top six qualify automatically for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.Wasteful Colombia fall to 10-man Ecuador, Paraguay draw at Bolivia Colombia lost 1-0 at home to 10-man Ecuador in South America’s qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday while Julio Enciso’s late equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Paraguay at Bolivia.Paraguay, who beat Argentina 2-1 last week, are now unbeaten in six games and sit sixth on 17 points in the CONMEBOL standings. Bolivia are four points behind in seventh.The top six qualify automatically for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada while the team in seventh spot gain entry to the inter-confederation playoffs.Ecuador jumped to third on 19 points, with Colombia fourth on goal difference following their second straight loss.Ecuador struck in the seventh minute through Enner Valencia following a terrific solo run but the visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 34th minute when Piero Hincapie was sent off for denying Jhon Cordoba a clear goal-scoring opportunity.Colombia were unable to find an equaliser despite having 25 attempts on goal, including a Luis Diaz header that struck the post before halftime, while they were also frustrated by a solid performance from Ecuador goalkeeper Hernan Galindez.Bolivia looked to make home advantage count against Paraguay at 4,150m above sea level in El Alto and they took the lead after 15 minutes via Ervin Vaca's first international goal.The hosts squandered several chances to extend their lead and Miguel Almiron found the equaliser for Paraguay with a first-time finish off a pass from Enciso in the 71st minute.Bolivia went ahead again nine minutes later when Miguel Terceros made no mistake from the penalty spot but Enciso halted the home fans’ celebrations early in stoppage time with a superb strike from the edge of the box.Paraguay came close to pulling out a last-gasp victory but goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra pulled off a brilliant save to deny Ramon Sosa. \nChina’s defense ministry blamed the United States’ stance on Taiwan for its minister not meeting his US counterpart during a gathering this week in Laos.Defence Minister Dong Jun turned down the US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s request to meet during a gathering of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) defense ministers, US officials said on Wednesday.“The US side cannot undermine China's core interests on the Taiwan issue while engaging with the Chinese military as if nothing is wrong,” a ministry spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday.The remarks raised questions over whether only a change in US policy towards the island can restore military-to-military talks at the defense minister level between the two countries. The failure to meet is “entirely the responsibility” of the US, the Chinese spokesperson said.The spokesperson also urged the US to “immediately correct its mistakes” and strive to create favourable conditions for high-level military exchanges between the two sides.China views democratically-governed Taiwan as its own territory, a claim that Taiwan’s government rejects.The US is Taiwan’s most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the lack of formal diplomatic recognition.Austin told reporters on Wednesday that the fact his Chinese counterpart declined to meet did not have any implications for the future.“I just think that it’s something that they chose to do at this point in time and only they can explain why they chose to not take advantage of a good opportunity,” he added.Divisions and anger spilled into the open at COP29 on Thursday as the closing deadline neared.Austin met China’s defense minister on the sidelines of a Singapore conference earlier this year, reiterating their differences on Taiwan and other issues but emphasizing the need to keep military-to-military communications open. \nThe United States rejected a decision by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense chief, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said.“The United States fundamentally rejects the Court’s decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials. We remain deeply concerned by the Prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision,” the spokesperson said, adding the US is discussing the next steps with its partners.Israel’s 13-month campaign in Gaza has killed about 44,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly all the enclave’s population while creating a humanitarian crisis, Gaza officials say. \nThe International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief, as well as a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict.In their decision, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a “widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza.”The decision was met with outrage in Israel, which called it shameful and absurd. Hamas welcomed the warrants against the Israelis, and a senior official told Reuters it was a first step towards justice.The warrant for Masri lists charges of mass killings during the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that triggered the Gaza war, and also charges of rape and the taking of hostages.Israel has said it killed Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, in an airstrike in July but Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied this. The prosecution indicated it would continue to gather information with respect to his reported death.Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza. The United States, Israel’s main diplomatic supporter, is also not a member of the ICC.ICC prosecutor Karim Khan had announced on May 20 that he was seeking arrest warrants for alleged crimes connected to the Hamas-led attacks on Israel and the Israeli military response in Gaza. Israeli and Hamas leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes.The court does not have its own police force to carry out arrests and relies on its 124 member states for that. Whether they are arrested or not depends on the member states. They have an obligation to do so but the court has only limited diplomatic means to force them if they do not want to.ReactionsNetanyahu’s office said the ICC decision was “anti-semitic” and he will “not yield to pressure, will not be deterred” until Israel's war objectives are met.The ICC has “lost all legitimacy” after issuing the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said.“A dark moment for the International Criminal Court,” Saar said on X, adding that it had issued “absurd orders without authority.”There was no immediate comment from Gallant.In a statement, Hamas welcomed the warrants against Gallant and Netanyahu and urged the court to expand accountability to all Israeli leaders.Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters the warrants against the Israelis were an important step towards bringing justice for the victims.\"But it remains a limited and spiritual step if it was not backed practically by all countries to get this decision implemented in compliance with law and justice,\" he said.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the decision was not a political one but made by a court and thus should be respected and implemented. “The tragedy in Gaza has to stop,” Borrell said.Jordan’s foreign minister Ayman Safadi also said the ICC’s decision must be implemented, adding that the Palestinians deserved justice after what he termed Israel's “war crimes” in Gaza.The Netherlands’ foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp said his country was prepared to act upon the warrants, Dutch news agency ANP reported.In the United States, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, said: “The Court is a dangerous joke. It is now time for the U.S. Senate to act and sanction this irresponsible body.”Israel’s 13-month campaign in Gaza has killed about 44,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly all the enclave’s population while creating a humanitarian crisis, Gaza officials say.It launched the campaign in response to the October 2023, Hamas-led attack which killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, with more than 250 others taken hostage, Israel has said. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nDating from the 13th century, the Kumari tradition in Nepal worships young girls as goddesses until they menstruate, with Matina Shakya being appointed in 2008 and replaced by Trishna Shakya in 2017 amidst evolving practices like education and support for ex-Kumaris.\nJuddha Shumsher Rana built a zoo in Jawalakhel Durbar in 1932, featuring a variety of animals including elephants, horses, deer, tigers, rhinos, leopards, red pandas, pheasants, and a lion.\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf plans a nationwide rally on November 24th to demand the release of imprisoned leader Imran Khan, amidst ongoing tensions with the military establishment.\nHuman activities have irreversibly altered the planet's ecosystem, pushing it beyond recovery and resulting in the Anthropocene epoch, which poses significant challenges for South Asia, particularly with regard to poverty and climate change, although awareness and cross-border cooperation remain deficient.\nDaman Nath Dhungana, a former Speaker and prominent Nepali figure, was known for his advocacy of democracy, human rights, and social justice, despite some controversies in his career.\nA drop in temperature has brought with it a sharp decline in air quality. Smog shrouds the skies, obscuring the hills and mountains surrounding Kathmandu Valley. While this is concerning, visuals of air pollution in the neighbouring countries have alarmed the world. Last week, images of the nearly invisible Taj Mahal and India Gate went viral. Further, the smog in parts of Pakistan and northern India was so dense that it was visible from space. According to the WHO, air with AQI values above 300 is labelled hazardous. It is only a matter of time before Kathmandu Valley and other parts of Nepal face a fate similar to India’s New Delhi and Pakistan’s Lahore, where AQI values have surpassed 1,000.Nepal is the third most polluted country in the world, according to a 2024 report by Air Quality Life Index (AQLI). Particulate pollution is the leading threat to human health in Nepal measured in life expectancy, reducing it by 3.4 years. By comparison, tobacco use cuts life expectancy by 1.9 years, while dietary risks and high blood pressure reduce it by 1.5 years each. What’s more, Nepal’s 30.7 million people live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline. Pretty much the same story repeats every year. On Thursday, Lalitpur’s air quality index reached 238 at 12:45 pm, getting closer to hazardous levels. Experts warned that air quality would go downhill in the coming days as farmers both in India and Pakistan clear fields after the autumn harvest. According to a recent report by Reuters, the burning of stubble left after harvesting rice has contributed to 40 percent of the pollution in Delhi. Such a dangerous practice in the Indo-Gangetic plains is bound to affect Nepal. We cannot solely blame our neighbours when we also indulge in harmful practices. A previous study shows that around three million tonnes of agricultural residue are burnt in the Tarai region. Besides these, emissions from vehicles, brick kilns, and open burning are among the country’s significant sources of pollution. If consumed for long, these pollutants are detrimental to our health. According to a 2024 report by the State of Global Air (SOGA), 75 percent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 39 percent of lung cancer deaths were attributed to air pollution. Even as our leaders inhale the same toxic air, their response to tackling air pollution has been woefully inadequate. While actions like banning open burning and monitoring brick kiln emissions have been introduced, they are limited to some local units. Even if vehicles pass emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and get green stickers, they still emit black smoke, as many only service them before the annual pollution tests. In response, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has purchased a smoke metre to test emissions from such automobiles.Although these actions are commendable, the federal government must do more. Exhaust from public vehicles is a major problem. Even as nearly 12,000 battery-powered vehicles were imported last year, these were primarily private ones. The government should open avenues for people to switch to eco-friendly ways of cooking and travelling. If we act seriously to reduce particulate pollution to WHO guidelines, countless lives could be saved. Additionally, residents of Tarai and Kathmandu could gain 4.8 and 2.6 years of life expectancy, respectively. While tackling domestic sources of air pollution is essential, it is as important to acknowledge its transboundary nature. Only a coordinated, collective, multinational effort can help clean up the air we breathe.  \nNepal’s hydroelectric potential is huge, with an estimated capacity of 40,000 megawatts. Nonetheless, the country has been unable to realise even a fraction of its potential due to limited market access and an unfavourable political climate. As a result, currently, the country generates just around 3,000 megawatts. The recent power trade with Bangladesh through India’s grid, however, could mark a turning point. Under the deal, yearly, 40 MW of electricity will be exported to Bangladesh for five years, from June 15 to November 15. This follows a tripartite agreement between the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, the Nepal Electricity Authority and the Bangladesh Power Development Board on October 3, 2024. The export, initially envisioned in 2018, was finally inaugurated on Friday. The agreement offers several advantages to all the countries and stakeholders involved. First, it strengthens regional cooperation and boosts economic development of these countries. Second, it promotes green energy in Bangladesh by reducing its reliance on fossil fuels. A 2022-23 government report of Bangladesh reveals that the country relies mostly on natural gas to meet its energy demand, and hydroelectricity accounts for only 1 percent of the total energy generation—24,911 MW. Nepal will also greatly benefit from this trade as it offers a chance to cut its trade deficit, which stands at Rs1.44 trillion; the agreement is expected to generate Rs330 million annually. Further, as Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line, the southern neighbour can also benefit from it.This agreement highlights the positive outcomes of nations working together for shared goals. It remains to be seen how sustainable it is though. Efforts should be made to facilitate uninterrupted electricity transmission, as international market access is crucial, especially for Nepal. While India’s willingness to facilitate power exports to Bangladesh is welcome, Nepal’s sole dependency on its southern neighbour for energy trade also cannot be denied. Without direct territorial links, Nepal’s ability to independently access foreign markets remains constrained. To overcome this, establishing a South Asian energy grid would be a game changer, enabling energy exchanges and opening avenues to harness the vast hydroelectric potential of the Himalayan region. Gaining India’s confidence and support for initiatives that enhance sub-regional productivity is vital in this regard. India therein also has a great opportunity to show that it is indeed a true leader of South Asia. As crucial as the agreement may seem, this agreement has only set a precedent. Nepal plans to produce 28,500 megawatts by 2035, so it must address a range of technical and regulatory hurdles to ensure both smooth production and cross-border transmission. Equally important is developing infrastructure to maximise the country’s electricity production. Again, concerted efforts from all South Asian countries can help the region increase its renewable energy generation and also boost sub-regional connectivity. The success of the Nepal-Bangladesh electricity export agreement offers a promising starting point for the realisation of these goals. What happens next will depend on the will of the Nepali political class to continuously follow the path of national prosperity.    \nPrime Minister and CPN-UML Chair KP Sharma Oli is not someone who minces his words. So when Oli was asked at the recent Kantipur Conclave whether he was worried about visiting China before going to India, it was interesting to see him struggle for the right words. He eventually said something along the lines that it is hard to discern which of the two neighbours is more important and should be his first port of call. Just so that the Indians are not spooked, he added “our relations with India are deep, historical, based on culture and tradition, and predate the formation of modern states.” Ever since he became prime minister around four months ago, PM Oli has been desperately trying to get an invite from New Delhi. This was why he had sat on an earlier offer to visit China. But when he saw that New Delhi was in no mood to invite him, Oli decided to visit Beijing first. Perhaps it was also a not-so-subtle signal to India that if it is not ready to engage with him, he will not be afraid to sidle closer to China.Balancing India and China would have been tricky for Prime Minister Oli irrespective of the kind of coalition he led. But as the head of a government where he is the prime minister but not the leader of the biggest party presents him with unique challenges. During his 2016 China trip following the Indian blockade, both the electorate and most political parties were strongly in favour of greater engagement with the northern neighbour. But this time, even his main coalition partner does not want him to sign any consequential agreements with China. The Nepali Congress says Nepal should not accept any loan under the Belt and Road Initiative. Rather than sign new agreements, it is in favour of asking the Chinese to follow through on their previous pledges. In other words, short of getting the Chinese to waive off the loan for the Pokhara International Airport—which, though a very long shot, could be a huge coup for the prime minister—Oli will struggle to portray his China visit as a success. If there can be no domestic political mileage for Oli, why go to China and risk losing face at home, even some UML leaders are asking? Whether a Nepali prime minister visits New Delhi or Beijing first, it should be up to Nepal to decide. That is not a big issue. What is more of a concern is that even when our prime minister embarks on a state visit to China, domestic political calculus rather than national interest will guide his decisions. So far, neither is the Congress ready to give him more of a leeway in negotiating with the Chinese nor is the UML in a place to say that it will do no important business with China. In the latter event, the Beijing visit will be reduced to a formality even before Oli embarks on it. This is not how coalitions work. How can people trust the government with anything if its constituent parties cannot even agree on how to deal with Nepal’s two most important international partners? And what does it say about the executive authority of the prime minister? The ruling coalition needs to immediately sort out its foreign policy mess before the country suffers an irreparable loss of trust abroad. \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is preparing to visit China in the first week of December. It will be his first bilateral visit after assuming the office in mid-July. Nepali prime ministers generally go to New Delhi first. Sudheer Sharma, former editor-in-chief of Kantipur daily, has recently published a pair of books on Nepal-China relations—‘Himalpari ko Huri’ and ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’. He also frequently writes on Nepal’s relations with its two big neighbours. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Sharma on the eve of Oli’s China visit. Prime Minister Oli is all set to visit China next month. Many find it curious that he decided to go to Beijing first before visiting New Delhi. How do you see this development?Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have given high priority to visits and engagements with our two neighbours–India and China. This is natural. Generally, the prime ministers first visited India and then went to China. I believe Prime Minister Oli tried to do the same. We see regular engagements with New Delhi at various levels. Prime Minister Oli had met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in the last week of September. In August, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India and met Prime Minister Modi and her counterpart S Jaishankar, among other key officials there. But Delhi has yet to extend the invitation to the prime minister. So he seems to have decided not to defer his foreign visits for long and chose to visit Beijing first. We have to see this in two perspectives. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and he is also going to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even in the past, Oli developed good relations with Chinese leaders. So, there are expectations that he may make the visit fruitful. An equally important concern is whether this visit impacts our relations with the southern neighbour India. I think the prime minister should focus on implementing the agreements reached during his previous visits to Beijing and during Chinese leaders’ Nepal visits. He should be mindful of not irking the southern neighbour while reaching any agreement with the northern one. I believe the prime minister is conscious of this.India often seems anxious about Chinese involvement in Nepal. Do you see any risk of this visit increasing the distance between Oli and India?Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited China first after he became prime minister in 2008. Even in the past, some Nepali prime ministers including Tanka Prasad Acharya went to China on their first official visit. This is not unusual. The two prime ministers—Oli and Modi—recently met in New York. India doesn’t seem ready to intensify bilateral engagements with Nepal immediately. So it is natural for the prime minister to increase engagements with China, without taking any steps that could provoke India. We should stop seeking Indian signals when dealing with China, and vice versa. We should maintain parallel relations with both the neighbours without antagonising any side.In this context, what should be the prime minister’s priorities during his China visit?We have to end our chronic problem of signing agreements and not implementing them. We make announcements and forget them. There are also some infrastructure projects China pledged to develop but there is little progress. So the prime minister should draw the Chinese leadership’s attention and press them to complete the projects on time. Some important projects such as Mugling-Pokhara and Narayanghat-Butwal road upgradation by the Chinese side have been slow, causing hardships to people. Even such issues should be communicated to the political level. Also, there are several commitments made by the Chinese government but left unimplemented. This creates an impression that China makes big promises but doesn’t keep them. Prime Minister Oli often highlights the Tokha-Chhahare road upgrade project under Chinese support but there is no satisfactory progress. Progress on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) on Nepal-China cross-border railway is unclear as well. Nepal expected some substantive support from China to make the Pokhara international airport financially feasible. Some concrete steps are needed to operate this airport. There are reports that the government has requested China to convert the loan taken to develop the airport into a grant and the prime minister will push for this during his visit. It will be an achievement if the prime minister succeeds in this. In the course of writing your recent books, you extensively interacted with Chinese officials and experts, as well as with their Nepali counterparts. What are the major factors delaying the projects? Is it lack of preparation on the Nepali side or is there any problem on the Chinese side?First, we [Nepalis] sign agreements but don’t work seriously to implement them. This is true in the case of agreements with other countries as well. We are negligent. Red tape is another problem. Third, China gives less priority to small countries like Nepal as it has so many big issues with other countries. We have to constantly follow up with them to speed things up. In the past, the two sides agreed to open more border points. This should be expedited. The people-to-people relations on the border areas were historically based on social interactions at the community level. People used to trade, marry those from the other side and interact in various ways. Of late, despite progress on infrastructure development, social engagement has been hindered. This should be rectified and new border points should be opened at Dolpa, Mustang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Taplejung, and Sankhuwasabha. We should think beyond the Capital-centric approach. This will help strengthen relations at the people’s level and give alternatives in our connectivity. We should put connectivity at the core of our relations with the two neighbours. In the past decade, we have made good progress in improving connectivity with India. A study report has been prepared on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway project. We are building an expressway linking Kathmandu and the southern belt of the country. Integrated check posts (ICPs) have come into operation along Nepal-India border points. Cross border electricity transmission lines have been built and we have increased energy trade with India. We have thus progressed in deepening connectivity with India. We lack reliable north-south highways. Therefore, the prime minister should make connectivity a major agenda of his China visit. Given the lacklustre performance of past projects, can we be optimistic about big cross-border infra projects under Chinese help?Nepal and China have committed to run some projects under the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) concept. A key component of this concept is to upgrade connectivity between Kathmandu and Kerung that includes roads as well as a railway. The concept also envisions operating other border points. The railway project requires more study and investment and needs to consider various other factors. For now, we should prioritise opening the aforementioned border points. The Korala border point at Mustang has huge potential. Nepal is making a road that connects Mustang with the Sunauli border point with India. Centuries ago, people from Banaras used to travel to Tibet via Mustang through this route. It can be revived and made a trilateral trade route between Nepal, India and China. Similarly, Limi in Humla, Olangchugola in Taplejung, among others places, can be developed as alternative routes. As far as Kerung-Kathmandu connection is concerned, let’s first give priority to building a reliable highway. The railway project should be developed with a broader understanding between Nepal, India and China. Beijing will develop such a big project only with the big Indian markets in mind. More importantly, there are some signs of improvements in India-China relations. We have to use this as an opportunity.There are differences in the way we work and the Chinese do and there are systemic and linguistic differences as well. These factors are often blamed for lack of progress in development activities carried out with Chinese support. Can Nepalis work closely with Chinese, just like we do with Indians?Until a decade ago, several projects developed under Indian support were left in limbo. In 2015, India imposed a blockade against Nepal and that sparked anti-India sentiment. Then, India expedited several projects. This drastic change became possible as the political leadership in India realised its mistake and showed the commitment to improve things.But the same thing is not happening with China because there is a “great wall” between Nepal and China when it comes to understanding each other. The Chinese haven’t understood Nepali context. The northern neighbour should be more open and liberal in helping Nepal. Second, Nepal should also stop approaching China only when our relations with India sour. We have left this impression on the Chinese psyche. First, we should be clear about what exactly we want from China, forge consensus among major political forces and hold talks with the Chinese leaders. Then, we should be equally committed to implementing the agreements reached this way. People now take announcements of building big projects under Chinese support as propaganda. Therefore, this time the prime minister should stress on pushing the pending projects. The prime minister should tell them that even the projects announced during President Xi’s visit have not progressed and that has created a bad impression of China in Nepal.There are some differences between the coalition partners—the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress—about the funding modality of projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). Do you think this may cause a problem?The UML wants to expedite the BRI projects while the Congress has insisted that we should accept only grants and not loans under the BRI. The prime minister should clear such dilemmas and come up with common views before he leaves for Beijing. Once they come up with a common view on such key issues, it will give a positive and strong message. The Chinese side will take it more seriously because the strong government led by the two largest parties can implement bilateral agreements.We have instances of Nepal’s political parties standing for and against important projects funded by other countries. This was seen in the case of the US-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and China’s BRI. Moreover, in the past, the Chinese leaders created an impression that they preferred working with communist parties and leaders. This is neither in the interest of Nepal nor of China.There are also discussions on signing the BRI implementation plan during the visit. What are the things Nepal should be careful about while signing BRI-related agreements?Trying to get grants instead of loans is in itself good. But there is no need to be prejudiced against the BRI per se. Nepal reportedly wants to include some points specifying waivers in specific projects. We should be very careful while signing project-based agreements. For instance, what will be the conditions and funding modality of a project, will it be developed under grants or loans etcetera. All our technical experts and other brains should be engaged while signing project-based agreements and specifying conditions and other nitty-gritty to ensure that we will not have unnecessary liability and debt burden in the future. Over time, Nepal has rightly adopted a steadfast position saying that we don’t join a strategic alliance proposed by any country. It stayed away from the US government’s State Partnership Programme (SPP) and China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI) as well as from India’s security umbrella. But we can’t be isolated in development initiatives. We have to take support from India, China, the US and other countries based on our needs.Do you think the Chinese side will show magnanimity on Nepal’s requests, for instance on waiving off the loan to develop Pokhara international airport?Though the Chinese ambassador to Nepal last year claimed the airport project to be under the BRI, the case is different because it was signed years before we joined the BRI. And, converting that loan into a grant is not a big deal for China. They should show magnanimity given the support we have been providing to China for a long time. If you see things historically, Nepal has helped China by suppressing Khampa revolt, preventing free Tibet movements on our soil and showing a steadfast commitment to One-China policy. China, which is now prosperous, should definitely show magnanimity and waive off loan of Pokhara airport. They shouldn’t see relations with Nepal through a purely transactional lens.In your book, you describe 2008 as a watershed after which the engagements between Nepal and China increased drastically. But why couldn’t we benefit from the northern neighbour in terms of development?The Chinese side looks more interested in increasing engagement. They like to showcase their development before foreigners. But more than lavish hospitality, we need substantive support from the neighbour, which has emerged as the world’s second-largest economy. But we should be clear about what we want from our engagements with China.  The Nepali side doesn’t present its proposals clearly. On certain issues, our politicians give mixed signals. This time, if this government of two largest parties reaches a certain agreement with China and remains committed to implement it, other forces can’t hinder it. The same approach can be replicated while dealing with India, the US, Japan or other friendly countries.Is difficult geography still a barrier in developing cross-border infrastructure projects and deepening relations between Nepal and China?In our textbooks we read that the Himalayan range is a natural barrier between the two countries. In my book ‘Bhikshu Byapar ra Bidroha’, I have explored and described how people from Nepal and northern India had been traversing through these mountains and there were interactions and engagements between the people in this part of the world since the 5th and 6th centuries. So, the mountains weren’t barriers even at that time. Now technology has made things easier. We have to think about how to connect with these two big economies. We have multiple east-west highways. Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries. \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nThe weather will be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of the country on Thursday, with fair skies across most of the country.
