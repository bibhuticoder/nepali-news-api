Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nEven as the recent agreement on framework for Belt and Road cooperation between Nepal and China continues to trigger heated debates in the country, visiting US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu has said that the BRI deal should be transparent.He also stated that before making any comment the US would wait until the text of the new agreement between Kathmandu and Beijing is made public. Before wrapping up his Nepal visit on Monday evening, Lu sat down with a group of journalists and shared what he had discussed with Nepali leaders and officials, including US priorities in Nepal, the ongoing transitional justice process and climate change. During Prime Minister KP Oli’s visit to China last week, a new framework for BRI cooperation was signed in order to push forward various projects under the BRI. After Nepal insisted on grants for expediting the projects under the BRI, at the last moment, the two sides reached an understanding on “aid assistance financing” as the funding method for projects under the framework. As the term “aid” entails both grants and soft loans, there is an uneasiness in the Nepali Congress and some other parties over whether Nepal has shifted its position on the kind of funding it wants under the BRI. But the text of the new understanding reached between Kathmandu and Beijing has yet to be made public, which also raised further speculations about its content. Lu, who arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday as part of his South Asia tour at the end of the Biden administration’s term, held talks with ministers and officials and discussed various aspects of Nepal-US ties, among other things. Lu, a seasoned American diplomat, is likely to serve at the State Department for another one year under the new Trump administration. During his stay in Kathmandu, Lu was unable to meet Prime Minister Oli as the latter was travelling to his hometown, Jhapa. But he met with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba; Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Bishnu Poudel; and two advisors to the prime minister, Bishnu Rimal and Yubraj Khatiwada; among others. He discussed with them the status of ongoing US projects in Nepal including those funded by the Millennium Challenge Nepal Corporation, USAID, seeking possible economic assistance from International Finance Corporation, climate change, and US priorities in Nepal. In his meeting with senior government officials including Rimal and Khatiwada, he congratulated them on successful negotiations with China on the BRI deal. Both Rimal and Khatiwada were part of a task force from ruling CPN-UML to review and amend the BRI implementation plan originally proposed by China in early 2020. They played crucial roles during the negotiation process. In their meeting with Lu, both Rimal and Khatiwada tried to assuage widespread concerns over the new BRI deal, with Khatiwada elaborating on Nepal’s current debt structure and other indicators, sources at the Prime Minister’s Office told the Post. “The United States is supporting Nepal in many areas, particularly in its economic development, and fostering relations with the goal of making Nepal a strong country that can make independent decisions, free from outside influence,” said Lu while talking to journalists.“We believe in taking independent decisions as well as maintaining transparency,” he said while responding to questions on how the US sees the recent BRI pact. “We have not seen the text, we have to read it,” he said. He said he would not make further comments on the pact until the details are out, “but it should be transparent.” When asked about Nepal’s departure from ‘one-China policy’ to ‘one-China principle’ and Nepal’s firm support for the ‘reunification of Taiwan’ and opposition to ‘Taiwan independence’ in the recent joint communique issued by Kathmandu and Beijing at the end the prime minister’s China visit, Lu said he was not aware of these, but commented that there should be mutual respect, as well as respect for sovereignty. Lu is known as a hawkish diplomat in Nepal, who in 2021 had warned that the US would be forced to rethink its ties with Nepal if Kathmandu failed to ratify the Millennium Challenge Corporation compact. Despite reservations from various sections, the Nepali parliament had ratified the compact. The US has been helping Nepal in various sectors, said Lu, especially focusing on Nepal’s economic development and advancing bilateral relations.“We want to see Nepal as a strong country so that it can take its decision without influence from outside,” he added. Nepal should have good relations with all countries—India, China, Pakistan, Turkey, Japan, Korea—but it should be based on mutual respect, respecting sovereignty and independence, he said.He hoped that the new Trump administration will keep supporting the climate causes. Trump is known for his climate skepticism and he had infamously pulled the US out of the Paris agreement during his last term as US president. He will again take the oath of office and secrecy on January 20. Lu expressed his excitement to see the progress in the MCC-funded projects. “We met ruling and opposition party leaders and we found a broader understanding on expediting the MCC [projects] which aims at jobs creation, exporting clean energy to India, and road infrastructure upgrade,” Lu said. He said he was excited that both ruling and opposition parties have come together to conclude the transitional justice process and on the MCC, and lauded Nepal’s recent achievements in getting itself a sovereign credit rating. “There are many challenging steps ahead, but it is impressive to see that it was adopted by consensus,” he said on the recent passage of a bill on transitional justice. Lu said he expects more high-level engagements with Nepal under the new Trump administration stating that Trump gives priority to Asia. “We had quite interesting and productive discussions on various issues ranging from bilateral cooperation, creating jobs, finding solutions to the climate crisis… talked about the development assistance from the MCC, Development Finance Corporation and recent interaction between prime minister Oli and Elon Musk,” he said. On Monday, Lu also joined the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development’s Director General, Dr Pema Gyamtsho, to kick off the ‘Green Alliance for Women’s Economic Security’ project in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region. The project will establish a regional platform for women entrepreneurs across the Hindu Kush, enabling knowledge exchange, best practice sharing, and tackling key challenges like gender discrimination, market access, and financial barriers, the US Embassy said in a Facebook post.  \nA year before the scheduled 15th general convention of the Nepali Congress, leaders from the party’s dissident faction have started exerting pressure on the leadership to hold the event in time.Shekhar Koirala, the Congress’s dissident faction leader, convened a gathering of chiefs of the party’s local units on December 3 in his hometown Biratnagar, demanding that the 15th general convention be held by mid-December next year.Addressing the gathering, he urged all the participants to start a pressure campaign from each of the local units they lead for the timely convention. “The longer the period the general convention is deferred, the weaker the party will become,” he said.On various occasions of late, Koirala has been consistently demanding that the party hold the convention as stipulated in the party statute.However, several party leaders the Post talked to see no chance of the party holding its national gathering in time. Congress, often dubbed the country’s grand old party, held its 14th general convention in mid-December 2021, and should hold the next convention by mid-December 2025 as per the party statute. If the party was to hold its general convention a year later, it should have started the convention-related activities by now but it hasn’t, says a leader.Krishna Paudel, the party office’s chief secretary, said Congress needs to settle various issues before its national gathering. He added the party needs to resolve issues related to active party membership before starting the process of the convention.Of the total 165 federal electoral constituencies, the issues of active party membership have been resolved only in the Kathmandu-4 constituency, according to party leaders.“Apart from this, the party needs to amend its statute to address various challenges the party is facing in the changing context and for that, the party will soon form a statute amendment committee,” Paudel said. “Despite pressure from a section to hold the general convention by the end of next year, the party is unlikely to do so.”The party statute gives each elected body a four-year tenure. However, the party charter provisions a one-year extension if the general convention cannot take place within four years. Further, Nepal’s constitution also envisions that political parties hold their conventions every five years. Article 269 (4) (b) of the constitution requires a political party to hold its general convention at least once every five years. In special circumstances, the constitution allows the event to be postponed for six months citing a valid reason.Congress leadership went for maximum extension allowed by the statute before holding the last general convention. Fearing that President Sher Bahadur Deuba could repeat the same situation, the Koirala-led faction plans to compel the party establishment to adhere to the party charter’s four-year gap between the two conventions as there is no crisis barring the party from holding the event.During the Mahasamiti meeting held in February, Gagan Thapa, a general secretary of the party, presented his organisational paper and proposed concluding the conventions of lower party committees by the end of November (last month). Under the plan, conventions of the ward units should have been held by the end of November, and conventions of village and city committees should have been held by the middle of this month.Thapa at the Mahasamiti meeting had proposed concluding the party’s all district conventions by mid-September 2025, provincial conventions by mid-November, and the general convention by mid-December 2025. The Congress chooses its leadership from the ward level to the centre through the conventions. The party conducts four tiers of direct elections. And general convention delegates are elected by and from among them.The organisational paper presented by the general secretary was endorsed by the Mahasamiti meeting, provided that it could also be amended by the central committee meeting. The subsequent central committee meeting of the party held in August also passed the paper presented by Thapa.Nevertheless, none of the party’s general convention-related activities have started in the lower units as per the schedule.Mahalaxmi Upadhyaya, a joint general secretary of the Congress, says that despite the party statute mentioning holding the general convention within four years, party history suggests that it gets extended at least by one year in accordance with the party charter.Several Congress leaders said that Deuba wouldn’t convene the general convention before taking charge of the government as per his deal with the CPN-UML.As per the Congress-UML agreement reached while forming the two-party government in July, Congress President Deuba will become prime minister after two years of signing the two-party deal.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli upon his arrival from the China visit on December 5 said that he would hand over the government leadership to Deuba after 18 months. If Congress follows the party statute to hold the general convention, it should take place just after a year, but Deuba will get the reins of government only 18 months later.Citing that, many Congress leaders said that Deuba will not hold the party's general convention without first taking charge of the government.“Since Deuba already has announced he won’t be in the race for the party's top position, becoming prime minister after relinquishing the post of party president might be difficult,” said a party leader.He may feel that his prospect of becoming prime minister as per the understanding with the UML might be in risk once a new leader elected from the convention heads the party, the leaders said.In the last general convention held in 2021 when Deuba and Koirala were contesting for the post of party president after the first round remained indecisive, Deuba while seeking the vote in the runoff had requested votes from the delegates saying his position of prime minister may not continue should he not remain the party chief.So Deuba will try to take the government reins before conducting the party convention, leaders say.Upadhyaya, however, differs.“The convention may not take place next year because no substantive preparation has yet begun,” she said, “not because his premiership will be challenged for not being the party chief.” \nThe much-delayed Dodhara Chandani dry port and check post project in farwestern Nepal took a step forward in September after the Sudhurpaschim provincial cabinet approved using forest land to build the facility.The cabinet has allowed the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board to use 43 hectares of Mayapuri community forest in the buffer zone of Suklaphanta National Park, clearing the project's last major hurdle. Nearly 1,700 trees have to be felled to make way for the project.Now, the project has stalled again because the board planned to pay a compensatory amount instead of planting trees on a separate land, as required by the law.According to the Forest Clearance Guidelines, ten trees must be planted for every one felled for development projects.“As we did not find suitable land to plant compensatory trees. We are making a cash payment instead and have written to the forest ministry accordingly,” said Ashish Gajurel, executive director of Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board. “We, however, have not heard back from the ministry.” The board sent its request to the ministry through the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation before the Dashain festival (early October).He said that once the ministry gives a go-ahead, the project would deposit Rs150 million, the estimated compensatory amount. “Any further delay by the government will also push back the construction timeline,” said Gajurel. The Rs15 billion project is located in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, Kanchanpur district, and is listed by the government as a national priority project.In 2023, the government approved the project's environmental impact assessment (EIA) report.Once completed, the dry port is expected to boost the Nepal-India trade and help drive industrial development in the western region.The Dodhara Chandani dry port will be the first business gateway to India from Nepal's farwest. The site is 245 km from India’s capital, New Delhi, and 1,200 km from Gujarat, which is among India’s fastest-growing states. Officials said the dry port will facilitate trade with other Indian states like Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and Haryana. It will also provide Nepal access to India’s largest seaport, Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai, boost Nepal's foreign trade, and reduce costs.Nepali officials say transporting goods to Nepal through these routes will result in substantial savings.Most of Nepal's trade infrastructure is concentrated in the east, connecting to Kolkata port. Officials say constructing a dry port in Sudurpaschim Province may open up access to more Indian ports in the future.The project is also expected to reduce transportation costs and reduce the time required to import goods from India.Dodhara Chandani inland container depot will feature administrative buildings, customs offices, banks, quarantine facilities, staff quarters, warehouses, and parking spaces.As per the master plan, the depot will eventually accommodate 3,000 20-foot freight trucks, although it will provide space for 300 trucks in the first phase.The import warehouse will be 7,000 square metres, and the export warehouse will be 2,520 square metres. The railway warehouse will be 17,500 square metres, and the container stacking yard, a large open space for container movement, will be 10,000 square metres.In the project's second phase, 126 hectares will be developed for additional warehouses and parking areas.Work has already started on a Rs3.2 billion access road on the Indian side connecting Dodhara Chandani. The Indian government is building the access road.Gajurel said that India has been preparing tender documents to start the construction of the dry port, which it is building on a grant.“Once we clear trees from the project sites, India will formally begin construction.”“As per discussions with Indian authorities, they plan to issue a tender within a month. Construction may begin within 3-4 months after a contractor is appointed,” said Gajurel.The deadline for the completion of the dry port is three years.A decade and a half ago, the World Bank conducted a feasibility study for the proposed dry port at Kanjabhoj in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, and the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board prepared another report in 2016.Three years ago, the government decided to construct the facility in ward 1 of Chandani Municipality. However, the project was relocated following protests by residents in Kanjabjoj, which is in ward 8, which was initially planned for the project. Last year, during then prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's visit to India, the Indian government agreed to build the facility.A four-lane bridge over the Mahakali River has been built, and an 8-km access road has been built on the Nepal side between Gaddachauki and the Malariya River in ward 1 of Dodhara Chandani.Meanwhile, according to Gajurel, the construction of the Rasuwa dry port at Nepal-China border in the north will be completed by mid-June next year. Gajurel said the construction of the Bhairahawa dry port is also expected to be completed by June of next year. \nNepal has been placed in a challenging Group F for the AFC Asian Cup 2027 Qualifiers following the draw held at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. Nepal will compete against Vietnam, Malaysia, and Laos, in what is expected to be a demanding group stage.Each team in the group will play home-and-away matches, starting on March 25, when Nepal faces Malaysia. Nepal will then play Malaysia again on November 18, Laos on June 10 and March 31 next year, and Vietnam on October 9 and 14.The qualifiers feature 24 teams divided into six groups, with the group winners securing a place in the AFC Asian Cup 2027 to be held in Saudi Arabia.Group A comprises Tajikistan, the Philippines, the Maldives, and Timor-Leste, while Group B includes Lebanon, Yemen, Bhutan, and Brunei. Group C features India, Hong Kong, and Bangladesh. Group D has Thailand, Turkmenistan, Chinese Taipei, and Sri Lanka, and Group E comprises Syria, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Pakistan. \nLumbini Lions in their winless journey set a target of 16 against Chitwan Rhinos in the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL) encounter at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.Chitwan won the toss, elected to field first, restricting the Lumbini to 167 at the loss of 6 wickets in 20 overs.Lumbini with a shaky start lost opener Aashutosh Ghiraiya 1[off 7 balls] in and and Arjun Saud 15[off 12 balls]. Rijan Dhakal took two major wickets of Aashutosh Ghiraiya and Unmukt Chand in an over. Lions lost their fourth wicket with Tom Moores bowled out by Rhinos’s captain Kushal Malla.Lumbini’s batting came into form with an exceptional batting partnership with Lions’ captain Rohit Paudel and Saad Zafar. Paudel made 81 runs off 57 balls while Zafar made 52 for 35 and was run out. For Rhinos Rijan Dhakal took 3 wickets giving off 29 runs. Kushal Malla and Ranjeet Kumar took a wicket each. \nMinister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba and the members of her delegation delivered Nepal’s oral statement at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Monday evening at the Court’s public hearings on the ‘Obligations of States in respect of climate change’.Speaking before the Court, Minister Deuba emphasised that despite Nepal’s snow-capped mountains and glaciers playing a crucial role in maintaining climate balance, supporting ecosystems, and preserving biodiversity, they were increasingly threatened by the rapid effects of global warming and consequent climate change. “We are having to bear the brunt of the impacts of climate change in a disproportionate manner. In fact, we are paying for a bad ‘karma’ we did not create,” Deuba stressed, according to a press statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the ministry, Foreign Minister Deuba underscored the vulnerability Nepal faced due to its geographical circumstances and relatively low level of development and made a strong case for climate justice to ameliorate the harsh suffering the climate change has brought to the lives of Nepali people. She called out the gross injustice that countries like Nepal were experiencing. “We have been penalized for the mistakes we never made, for the crimes we never committed,” she added. Speaking on human rights law-related obligations of States in connection with climate change, Deuba highlighted Nepal’s position that many vulnerable States were not able to meet the obligations under international human rights law as the actions and emissions arising from beyond their territory also had effects on the specific rights of their citizens. According to the ministry, Nepal’s position on the other aspects of State obligations regarding climate change was presented by Udaya Raj Sapkota, secretary of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. Secretary Sapkota underscored that the general obligation to prevent transboundary harm, based on the concept of due diligence, was a well-established rule in international law. He added that such an obligation was applicable in the context of climate change as well. Sapkota clarified Nepal’s position on the ‘differentiated’ nature of obligations based on treaties related to climate change. “He also called for considering specific vulnerabilities of landlocked and mountainous countries as well as overall economic capabilities and constraints, while applying the principle of differentiated obligations,” he added.Nepal also stressed the duty of assistance where the developed countries have an obligation under the Paris Agreement to provide financial resources for assisting developing countries in mitigation and adaptation. “Under this duty of assistance, developed states have an obligation to support the neediest among the developing countries –the least developed, small islands, and mountainous countries,” Sapkota said. In Nepal’s third and last oral statement, Suvanga Parajuli, under-secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, spoke on the legal consequences when the States fail to uphold the obligations regarding climate change. Parajuli refuted the characterization of the climate crisis as a “collective tragedy where no specific responsibility could be assigned”. He argued that the responsibilities could be established based on the customary international law on the responsibility of states regarding internationally wrongful acts. He said the developed countries have a collective duty to compensate for the harm caused by their historic emissions given the composite nature of state responsibility in climate change. “What countries like Nepal are calling for is not mere handouts or charity, but compensatory climate justice,” he said. The oral proceedings are being held at the seat of the Court in the Hague, the Netherlands from 2 to 12 December. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the Permanent Court of the United Nations, which has 15 judges elected for nine-year terms, handles two types of proceedings: contentious cases (settling legal disputes between states) and advisory proceedings (providing legal opinions based on the request by the UN). The ongoing proceedings are of an advisory nature, which will help clarify the legal questions posed before the Court by the UN General Assembly on March 29, last year. According to the ministry, current hearings are instituted by the Court pursuant to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/77/276, of March 29, last year. The resolution, of which Nepal was also one of the co-sponsors, requested the Court to render an advisory opinion on the obligations of States regarding climate change. This is also the first case where the General Assembly requested for the Court’s advisory opinion through a consensus resolution. “Foreign Minister Deuba’s participation at the ongoing hearing is the first-ever participation of Nepal in the ICJ,” the ministry said. “This reflects the urgency Nepal attaches to the question of climate justice.” \nThe US Department of the State has honoured journalist Matrika Dahal of Kantipur daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, as a 2024 Anti-corruption champion.He was felicitated by the US Secretary of State Antony J Blinken amid a function in Washington DC on Monday.“The U.S. prioritizes the fight against corruption, but it can't succeed alone. That's why @StateDept is honoring 10 remarkable individuals whose courage and dedication have made a significant impact in preventing, exposing, & combating corruption. Congratulations!” the US Dept of State INL wrote on X.Professionals from various countries including a judge, lawyer, professor, army officer, activist and journalist were awarded for their contributions in controlling corruption in their respective countries.Kantipur journalist Dahal was recognised for his continuous reporting in various corruption scams. Some of his works include extensive coverage to expose the fake Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and gold smuggling case. All these scams were carried out in collusion between politicians, government officials and middlemen.“This award has further encouraged me to work in the field of investigative journalism with more courage,” Dahal said after receiving the award. \nIn August this year, the three major parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—joined hands to pass the long-stuck bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act-2014. Their action was widely hailed as a big milestone in Nepal’s transitional justice process. But now, when time has come to pick the candidates for the two important transitional justice bodies—the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP)—which have been without office-bearers since 2022, the parties are faltering. The names shortlisted as potential office-bearers of these commissions have sparked controversy, with conflict victims accusing the parties of overlooking their concerns.These commissions’ role in concluding Nepal’s peace process is pivotal. The CIEDP was formed to find the whereabouts of the disappeared persons, recommend reparation to victims and prosecute the accused related to the armed conflict. Similarly, the TRC is there to investigate serious human rights violations, identify those involved and recommend reparative and legal measures. It also envisioned reconciliation, mutual goodwill and peace between perpetrators and victims. Yet, they have fallen woefully short of the expectations of both victims and rights activists. Due to a lack of competence and constant political meddling, they haven’t progressed beyond collecting complaints and conducting initial investigations in a handful of cases. This is the third time the government is appointing officials to these commissions. Still, past mistakes in the selection of office-bearers are being repeated, as a recommendation committee has been formed under the leadership of a person who botched the same job in 2020. The chairpersons and members of the two commissions nominated under him had failed to perform their duties. The names shortlisted this time have also disappointed rights activists and victims alike. Despite their repeated calls to select the commissions’ leaderships through a consultative, transparent and inclusive process, their concerns went unheeded. The list, in the eyes of rights activists and victims, prioritises controversial figures over competent and deserving ones. This leaves one wondering if the parties had a hidden agenda behind the August agreement, as it seems partisan interests have again prevailed over national healing. The politicisation and manipulation of these commissions’ selection processes will not ensure justice for the victims of the insurgency. When the parties united to conclude the process back in August, the international community had immediately welcomed the move, but the new controversy over the shortlisted names again risks discrediting the whole process, both at home and abroad. What’s more concerning is that the National Human Rights Commission, which should have acted as a watchdog in the process, is silent, perhaps because one NHRC commissioner is a member of the recommendation panel. The rights watchdog’s complicity will further erode its public trust. Justice delayed has already become justice denied for many conflict victims. For the transitional justice process to come to a successful end, top political leaders and parties must rise above petty interests and acknowledge long-term damage their misjudgement can inflict on the conflict victims who have now waited for justice for nearly two decades since the guns fell silent in 2006. If these commissions again fail in their responsibilities, it will be seen as a sign of the failure of the democratic process in the country. Nepal needs competent people in the two commissions, those with unwavering integrity and commitment to justice. We have ample evidence now that compromised transitional justice bodies cannot work in the interest of victims.   \nI had taken a short hiatus from writing this column. For an academic, balancing research, teaching, and the pressures of public commentary often means one has to step back from the writing routine once in a while. However, with the recent high-profile visit of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to China, I felt this was an opportune moment to pick up my writing again.In April 2016, I wrote about Oli’s official visit to China and the media coverage it received. At that time, while Indian media extensively covered the visit, the English-language press in China offered little commentary, although Chinese outlets did publish plenty of headlines. Despite this, Chinese media coverage of Nepal has generally been optimistic, albeit often bland and prosaic.However, the situation has grown more complicated in recent years. With the slow progress in the implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since Nepal joined the project over seven years ago, concerns about trade imbalances, debt dependency and tensions with India over China’s growing influence in Nepal have surfaced. The media hysteria surrounding the BRI, both in Nepal and India, has further frustrated both sides. Against this backdrop, seeing how Chinese news outlets framed Oli’s visit this time was interesting.Oli’s visit generated substantial and coordinated media coverage. In major Chinese English-language outlets such as People’s Daily, China Daily, Global Times, CCTV, CGTN and Xinhua, the framing oscillated between strategic cooperation, historical camaraderie, and the promise of economic transformation with a forward-looking tone focusing on development cooperation and mutual benefits. Coverage also incorporated human interest angles and increased multimedia content, suggesting an effort to engage a wider audience. Given the state-controlled nature of Chinese media, critical coverage remains rare, and alternative views are often subtly implied through language choices or omissions. One dominant theme in the coverage was political cooperation. Articles emphasised the \"everlasting friendship\" and the growing \"strategic partnership\" between Nepal and China. The reaffirmation of Nepal’s commitment to the \"One-China\" policy was framed as highly appreciative, a natural extension of historical and cultural ties, portraying Nepal as a reliable partner aligned with China's broader geopolitical interests in South Asia. This optimistic coverage may be seen as overlooking the strain it may put on its traditionally close relationship with India. However, an editorial in China Daily attempted to reassure India, clarifying that Oli’s choice of China for his first visit was not aimed at India.Another prominent theme was the economic opportunity presented by the BRI. Coverage highlighted Nepal’s transformation from a \"landlocked\" to a \"land-linked\" nation through improved infrastructure—roads, railways and ports. Chinese outlets cited Xi Jinping’s comments during the visit, underlining the “transformative” potential of the BRI for Nepal’s modernisation and economic growth. These portrayals focus on the benefits of enhanced regional connectivity, trade and investment, presenting the BRI as a win-win for both countries. However, concerns about Nepal falling into a \"debt trap,\" particularly related to projects like the Pokhara International Airport, were largely absent in Chinese media coverage. Global Times, more critical in its stance, quoted Chinese sources lambasting Indian portrayals of Nepal’s BRI ties as a debt trap, citing India’s hegemonic attitude and its failure to respect Nepal’s sovereignty.Geopolitical balance and Nepal's sovereignty appeared as another theme in discussions about Nepal’s growing engagement with China. Chinese media presented these ties as a strategic diversification, reflecting Nepal’s desire to assert its independence in foreign policy and maintain neutrality between global powers. Yet, concerns regarding Nepal’s increasing dependence on Chinese capital and infrastructure—such as rising debt and its impact on Nepal’s autonomy—were barely addressed. Tourism also emerged as a key theme, especially with the Visit Nepal 2025 initiative. Chinese media focused on the economic potential of attracting more Chinese tourists, highlighting the boost to revenue and local businesses. Nepali businesses were portrayed as highly optimistic, with no mention of potential challenges. Arjun Prasad Sharma, honorary vice president of the Nepal Chamber of Commerce, was quoted by Global Times saying, “The Nepali business community loves to import from China.” Concerns about Nepal’s potential over-reliance on Chinese tourism, which could limit diversification in the sector, were seldom mentioned. While Chinese media celebrated the economic benefits, they rarely addressed the risks of depending on a single country for such a crucial sector.Another theme in the coverage was Nepal’s potential to benefit from China’s technological advancements. Chinese media highlighted opportunities for Nepal to emulate China’s successes in information technology, renewable energy and transportation infrastructure. These stories underscored the transformative potential of technology transfer and economic cooperation, yet they failed to acknowledge Nepal’s limitations in implementing such ambitious projects. Political instability, resource constraints and a lack of capacity to absorb advanced technologies could hinder the successful application of these solutions. The practical challenges Nepal faces in integrating these technologies into its infrastructure require more nuanced media scrutiny.The lack of direct interviews or attributions from Nepali critics of the BRI or other aspects of Nepal-China relations is notable. Most often, criticism comes from Indian media or critics, leaving Nepal without its own voice. This absence of Nepali agency in Chinese coverage raises questions about the depth of engagement with diverse viewpoints.Overall, the dominant themes in the coverage align closely with China’s official stance on Nepal, but this time, there is a noticeable shift in approach. Chinese outlets have included more opinion-based content, with editorial pieces offering perspectives from external contributors. Multimedia content, such as photo displays and video features, has also increased, reflecting a desire to engage a broader audience interested in Nepal-China relations.Interviews with Nepali students and professionals and side stories, such as a profile of a Nepali professional making an impact in China, suggest a multifaceted view of the relationship, extending beyond state-level interactions. This suggests China’s growing interest in Nepal’s cultural and social spheres and deepening bilateral ties.Nepali-language coverage in CRI Nepal and CGTN, often featuring identical content, further indicates China’s greater effort to engage the general Nepali public. Although Chinese media often cite Indian media in their coverage of Nepal, particularly relating to controversies surrounding the BRI, some Chinese media cited Nepali outlets for context, reflecting their desire for the authenticity of Nepali perspectives. The increased breadth of coverage may signal the upcoming 70th anniversary of bilateral relations, which is likely to bring even more media attention to Nepal-China ties in the coming year. \nWhen student-led, anti-government protests in Bangladesh snowballed into the ouster of Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year-long autocratic rule in August 2024, many in the South Asian nation hoped it signalled better times ahead.Four months on, things are not going to plan. The initial surge of public jubilation has given way to pessimism. The interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, is grappling with governance problems, political instability, religious extremism and a fragile economy. Moreover, a series of recent events have highlighted and exacerbated Bangladesh’s fraught diplomatic relations with neighbouring India.The arrest of a Hindu monk in Muslim-majority Bangladesh on Nov. 24, 2024, encapsulates the problems facing Yunus. The detention of Chinmoy Krishna Das (also known as Chandan Dhar) was followed by sectarian violence in which a Muslim lawyer was killed and anti-Bangladesh protests in India.As an expert on Bangladesh’s political and social landscape and a former Indian High Commission employee in Dhaka, I believe it is clear that how Yunus addresses myriad challenges—upholding the rule of law, managing the economy, ensuring safety for minorities and rebuilding relations with India—will be critical for restoring democratic health in Bangladesh.A public safety crisisThe interim government’s immediate challenge is addressing deteriorating law and order.While Hasina’s authoritarian rule left little space for democracy or dissent, her abrupt removal in August has created a power vacuum in which previously marginalised political factions compete for influence and public support.This has coincided with a rise in vigilante justice, extortion and the abuse of the legal system for settling political disputes. The mob lynching of 49 people, mostly political opponents, since Hasina’s ouster is symptomatic of Bangladesh’s current lawlessness.The police’s reluctance to address this security vacuum has only worsened the situation. Law enforcement’s heavy-handed response to anti-Hasina protests generated widespread anger among Bangladeshis.Following Hasina’s fall, angry mobs set fire to numerous police stations and killed 44 on-duty policemen. Much of the police force has become demoralised, fearful and hesitant to enforce lawful crowd-control measures.An economy in crisisMaking matters worse, years of economic mismanagement and corruption have left Bangladesh struggling with high youth unemployment, runaway inflation and a collapsing banking sector. Its external debt has jumped from US$62 billion to over $100 billion in just five years, which critics have blamed, in part, on large infrastructure projects rife with corruption.Managing this debt will pose a significant challenge. Bangladesh’s dwindling foreign reserves make debt repayments and currency stabilization difficult, while also exerting inflationary pressure on the economy. And inflation remains persistently high, with essential goods becoming increasingly unaffordable for many Bangladeshis.Adding to these problems is a wave of labour unrest. Workers across various sectors have organised protests over unpaid wages and unsafe working conditions. Some of this labour unrest has turned violent, forcing hundreds of factories to shut down. Moreover, factories owned by individuals close to the Hasina government have also been targeted, including a suspected arson attack of a tire factory.The bleak economic situation and ongoing labor unrest has seriously affected the garment sector, Bangladesh’s main foreign export, which threatens international demand and could further imperil the economy.The return of extremismThe challenges faced by Bangladesh’s interim government have been exacerbated by the resurgence of Islamic extremism and sectarian violence that have long plagued Bangladesh, particularly since the return of Bangladeshi mujahadeen fighters after the Afghan-Soviet war.Though temporarily suppressed during Hasina’s authoritarian rule, Islamic extremists and vigilantes have gained confidence in recent months and have violently attacked religious and ethnic minorities, as well as sex workers. Vigilantes have destroyed thousands of Hindu homes, businesses and places of worship across the country, causing deep insecurity within the minority Hindu community, which makes up 8 percent of the population. Extremists have also vandalised about 40 Sufi Muslim shrines.Meanwhile, Bengali Muslim settlers have attacked ethnic Indigenous groups in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in the country’s southeast, resulting in the deaths of at least three people and the burning of numerous homes and businesses.The recent violent attacks on the offices of two leading newspapers, which had been accused of anti-Islamic bias, further highlight the threat posed by emboldened religious extremists.Neighbourly squabblesAttacks on Hindus have also strained diplomatic relations with neighbouring India.Under Hasina, Bangladesh maintained a close alliance with India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In addition to joint security collaboration to counter Chinese influence in South Asia, Delhi has also made substantial infrastructure investments in Bangladesh, including $8 billion in loans for various development projects.But Indian-Bangladeshi relations have been tense following Hasina’s ouster. The former autocratic leader fled to Delhi, where she currently resides, despite plans by the interim government to seek her extradition. Yunus has accused Hasina of continuing her political operations and trying to undermine Bangladesh’s new leaders while being harboured by India.The arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das on sedition charges has only exacerbated Indian-Bangladeshi tensions. India’s government has expressed “deep concern” over the monk’s arrest and called for the protection of Hindus in Bangladesh.The chief minister of West Bengal, India, called for deploying a United Nations-led peacekeeping force in Bangladesh to safeguard minorities, while some leaders from India’s ruling Hindu nationalist BJP party have demanded trade embargoes on Bangladesh.India holds significant leverage over Bangladesh, both economically and geopolitically. With bilateral trade volumes of $14 billion, India is Bangladesh’s largest trading partner and a key source of essential imports. If India perceives the new government as hostile, it could impose punitive measures that might further cripple Bangladesh’s fragile economy, similar to its unofficial blockade of Nepal in 2015 that led to a severe humanitarian crisis.The Indian High Commission in Dhaka is highly influential and deeply connected to Bangladeshi politics. A key part of its influence comes from issuing about 2.5 million visas each year to Bangladeshis travelling to India for medical and other reasons. Since Hasina’s fall, India has restricted the issuing of these visas.A return of autocratic rule?Given the two countries’ deep economic ties and geographic proximity, I believe Yunus needs to delicately navigate bilateral relations with India. He has to be particularly mindful that Hasina’s current exile in India and the ongoing attacks on Hindu minorities in Bangladesh could provide India with a pretext to more strongly intervene in Bangladeshi politics.Bangladesh’s current trajectory is, I believe, worrying. How the Yunus government deals with these heightened risks will say a lot about the future direction of the country. Indeed, any failure in these areas could lead to yet more instability, complicating the country’s long-term prospects and making it easier to envision the return of an authoritarian regime.–The Conversation \nProvincial assembly parliamentary committees are pivotal to strengthening federalism in Nepal. These committees work to hold provincial governments accountable. Even when the assembly is not in session, the committees can continue working. As the provincial assemblies cannot manage all the tasks, these committees, with various thematic jurisdiction and expertise, work by often rising above partisan interest to save the parliament’s time; they simplify work and conduct various studies. Article 193 of the Constitution of Nepal specifies that “the State Assembly may, as per its rules, form committees or special committees, as required, to manage its working procedures”. Thus, the number of thematic areas varies in each province. However, the functioning of these committees is undermined in several provinces. In Karnali, three of the four parliamentary committees—the Finance and Natural Resources Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Social Development Committee—are currently without heads. While the first committee has had no chief since April this year, the latter two have been vacant for three months. The prolonged leadership vacuum in important committees is also something that is routinely seen in other provinces. The five committees in Bagmati were at a standstill without chairpersons for more than a year since the first session of the start of the second term of the Bagmati Provincial Assembly in January 2023. The parliamentary committees in Lumbini and Sudurpaschim have been without their chairs after the formation of their respective assemblies last year. The absence of chiefs of these key provincial assembly parliamentary committees makes it difficult to hold the provincial governments accountable. These governments fail on governance, budget implementation and role assignment to the provincial assemblies. Passage of essential bills is also hampered. Four critical bills are stuck in various committees in Karnali. Meetings to facilitate dialogue between assembly members and ministers are yet to be convened. Moreover, the provincial government, taking advantage of the committee’s ineffectiveness and lack of monitoring, has been working arbitrarily, bypassing essential checks and balances.This in turn has added to the woes of Karnali, a geographically remote and severely underdeveloped region in western Nepal. The inactivity of the Social Development Committee is particularly concerning in a province where basic social indicators, such as health and literacy, lag far behind the national average. As the committee also deals with ministries of land management, agriculture and cooperatives, labour and social justice and human rights commission, works related to these areas are also affected. Despite the province’s rich natural resources, their potential remains untapped. Lack of development activities, particularly road-related infrastructure, has affected the province’s tourism prospects. The inactivity of the Finance and Natural Resources Committee is, therefore, troubling. More worryingly, another leaderless committee—Public Accounts—which oversees the financial discipline of the province, could fail to monitor corruption activities.Provincial governments were envisioned as significant drivers of localised development and accountability, but they have often become battlegrounds for political manoeuvring. Because of this, appointments for the leadership positions in these committees, as has happened in Bagmati in the past, have been deliberately delayed by the political parties. Even though Karnali’s assembly regulations allow the eldest member of the assembly committee to act as an interim chief, this provision has not been invoked. The political parties would do well to appoint the chairs immediately to stop the erosion of public trust in provincial governments—unless that is precisely their intent.    \nNew York prosecutors filed a murder charge against the suspect in the killing of a UnitedHealth executive, a brazen shooting that set off a manhunt that culminated in his capture in Pennsylvania earlier on Monday.The action brought an end to a tense five-day manhunt for the suspected killer.The suspect, identified as Luigi Mangione, 26, was captured in Altoona, Pennsylvania after he was spotted eating at a McDonald’s by a customer and an employee who believed he resembled the gunman, officials said at a news conference.When approached by two police officers inside the McDonald’s and asked if he had recently been in New York, Mangione began to shake and went quiet, one of the responding officers said at a press conference. He had been wearing a mask and sitting alone with a laptop and backpack.A search of the backpack at the police station turned up a black “ghost gun” - a firearm assembled from parts, making it untraceable - loaded with a magazine and a silencer. Pennsylvania authorities said the weapon, as well as clothing and a mask, were similar to those used by the killer.Mangione was led into the Blair County courthouse in Altoona for his arraignment on Monday night, where gun and forgery charges were read against him. The judge asked Mangione if he understood the charges against him, and he said he did. No plea was entered.Prosecutors in New York brought a murder charge, along with four related gun charges, against Mangione, according to court records.Pennsylvania prosecutors, citing false IDs and a large sum of cash that were found on Mangione, argued he was a flight risk and asked that bail be denied, which it was. Several electronic devices were also found with the suspect, and they were being examined by police.Officers in Pennsylvania said at a press conference that they were working to determine if Mangione had any accomplices and if he intended to kill anyone else. They said he had been in Pennsylvania for several days and were investigating exactly where he was and what he did in the state.Mangione, a Maryland native, had multiple fraudulent identifications, including a fake New Jersey ID that matched the one used by the gunman to check into a Manhattan hostel days before the shooting, officials said.Police also found a handwritten document that speaks to “both his motivation and his mindset,” New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said earlier on Monday.While the document did not mention specific targets, Mangione harboured “ill will toward corporate America,” said Joseph Kenny, the NYPD’s chief of detectives.Mangione graduated from a private all-boys school in Baltimore as valedictorian in 2016 before earning dual engineering degrees in 2020 at the University of Pennsylvania, a prestigious Ivy League university, according to school records. His last known address was in Honolulu, officials said.Thompson, 50, was gunned down outside a Manhattan hotel early on Wednesday morning by a masked man who appeared to wait for his arrival before shooting the executive from behind.The suspect ran from the scene and then rode a bike into Central Park. Surveillance video captured him exiting the park and taking a taxi to a bus station in northern Manhattan, where police believe he used a bus to flee the city.DENY DEFEND DEPOSEPolice said Thompson appeared to be deliberately targeted and were investigating whether others also may have been at risk.The words “deny,” “defend” and “depose” were carved into shell casings found at the scene, several news outlets have reported. The words evoke the title of a book critical of the insurance industry published in 2010 titled “Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don’t Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.”A Facebook profile that appears to belong to Mangione identified him as a native of Towson, Maryland, and a former student at the University of Pennsylvania. Photos appear to show Mangione at Stanford University wearing Stanford-branded clothing.An X account that appears owned by Mangione says he lives in Honolulu, Hawaii.Thompson’s murder unleashed a wave of frustration from Americans who have seen their health insurance claims or care denied, faced unexpected costs or paid more for premiums and medical care - all trends that are rising, according to recent data.Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, speaking at a press conference with prosecutors and police in Altoona, said he understood the frustrations that some Americans, angered by health insurance companies and their refusal to pay for some treatments, had expressed online since Thompson’s killing. But he rejected the glorification of the suspect in some circles online.“In America, we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,” Shapiro said.Thompson, a father of two, had been CEO of UnitedHealth Group’s insurance unit since April 2021, part of a 20-year career with the company. He had been in New York to attend the company's annual investor conference.“Our hope is that today’s apprehension brings some relief to Brian’s family, friends, colleagues and the many others affected by this unspeakable tragedy,” a spokesperson for UnitedHealth said. \nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been banned from leaving the country over a failed attempt at imposing martial law, a justice ministry official said on Monday, amid growing calls for him to step down and a deepening leadership crisis.Yoon has apologised for the botched attempt and said he was leaving his political and legal fate to his ruling People Power Party (PPP) but has not resigned. He has become the subject of criminal investigation, according to local media reports.On Monday, the defence ministry said Yoon was still legally commander in chief, but growing dissent among senior military officers against the president has thrown into question his grip on power.Oh Dong-woon, the head of the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, said he had barred Yoon from foreign travel when asked at a parliament hearing what actions have been taken against the president.A justice ministry official, Bae Sang-up, told the committee the travel ban order had been executed.The panel was established in 2021 to investigate high-ranking officials including the president and their family members but it does not have authority to prosecute the president. Instead, it is by law required to refer the matter to the prosecutors’ office.While Yoon survived an impeachment vote in parliament on Saturday, his party’s decision to delegate presidential authority to the prime minister has plunged the key US ally into a constitutional crisis.Yoon has refused calls, including some from within his own ruling party, to resign, but his future looked more uncertain over the weekend when Yonhap news agency reported he was under criminal investigation for alleged treason.Prosecutors on Sunday arrested ex-defence minister Kim Yong-hyun over his alleged role in the declaration of martial law on December 3, Yonhap reported.Yoon gave the military sweeping emergency powers on December 3 to root out what he called “anti-state forces” and obstructionist political opponents. He rescinded the order six hours later after parliament voted against the decree.Amid the backlash, multiple military officials, including the acting defence minister, have said they would not follow any new order to impose martial law again.The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) has called for Yoon to be stripped of his authority over the military. The DP has also demanded the arrest of Yoon and any military officials implicated in the martial law fiasco.The head of a task force established by Yoon's party to handle his eventual and “orderly” resignation, Lee Yang-soo, said the team would consider all options and timing for the president’s early departure “without any limitations”.On Sunday, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said the president would be excluded from foreign and other state affairs, and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would manage government affairs.That proposal has drawn criticism from the opposition, which says it is unconstitutional. It says Yoon must be impeached or resign and face legal prosecution, and plans to table another impeachment bill on Saturday.Chang Young-soo, a professor at the School of Law at Korea University, said the president was able to delegate authority to the prime minister, especially his control of the military, but there is debate on whether the prime minister has the authority to act as head of state on diplomatic matters.“Also, unlike a US vice president, a South Korean prime minister is not elected, which means democratic legitimacy is weak. So it will also be an issue how long this system can go on,” he said.MILITARY BACKLASHOpposition leader Lee Jae-myung said on Monday the political crisis threatened to cause irreversible harm to Asia's fourth-largest economy, a major global supplier of memory chips.South Korea’s finance ministry and regulators said they would make all-out efforts to stabilise financial markets by deploying contingency plans and boosting liquidity by end-December.In the latest sign of dissent within military ranks, the commander of South Korea’s special forces said he was ordered to send his troops into parliament last week to stop a vote to reject martial law.Colonel Kim Hyun-tae, the commanding officer of the 707th Special Missions Group, said he took responsibility for his troops’ actions but he was acting under orders from then defence minister Kim Yong-hyun.“We were all victims who were used by the former defence minister,” he told reporters outside the defence ministry.He said he had not told the military about his plan to speak to the media out of fear he might be stopped.Yoon’s decision to declare emergency rule stirred protests on the streets and raised alarm among Seoul’s allies.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin scrapped plans to travel to South Korea and Secretary of State Antony Blinken called his South Korean counterpart, saying he expected the democratic process to prevail.The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.The turmoil in Seoul comes at an important geopolitical moment in the region, with North Korea reportedly sending troops to help Russia’s war against Ukraine amid growing military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.South Korean foreign minister Cho Tae-yul told ministry officials: “We must also be unremitting in our efforts to restore the trust of our partners and once again measure up to the expectations of the international community towards Korea.” \nOusted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s prime minister said he had agreed on Monday to hand power to the rebel-led Salvation Government, a day after the rebels seized the capital Damascus and Assad fled to Russia.The imminent transfer of power follows 13 years of civil war and the end to more than 50 years of brutal rule by the Assad family, leaving Syrians at home and millions of refugees abroad hopeful yet deeply uncertain about their country's future.Oil prices rose more than 1% on Monday, partly on concerns that uncertainty in Syria, which is not a major oil producer, could raise regional instability, analysts said.Damascus stirred to life on Monday, with traffic returning to the streets and people venturing out after a nighttime curfew, but most shops remained shut.Fighters from the remote countryside milled about in the capital, clustering in the central Umayyad Square.“We had a purpose and a goal and now we are done with it. We want the state and security forces to be in charge,” said Firdous Omar, who said he had battled the Assad government since 2011 and now looked forward to resuming work as a farmer in provincial Idlib.Assad’s prime minister, Mohammed Jalali, told Al Arabiya TV he had agreed to hand power to the Salvation Government, an administration based in rebel-held territory in northwest Syria.He said the handover could take days to carry out.The main rebel commander Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, met overnight with Jalali and Vice President Faisal Mekdad to discuss a transitional government, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. Golani has vowed to rebuild Syria.Al Jazeera television reported the transitional authority would be headed by Mohamed al-Bashir, who ran the Salvation Government before the 12-day lightning offensive swept into Damascus.The advance of a militia alliance spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, was a generational turning point for the Middle East.The rebel sweep ended a war that killed hundreds of thousands, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble, the countryside depopulated and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions.QATAR OPENS CONTACTSAssad’s police state was known as one of the harshest in the Middle East, holding hundreds of thousands of political prisoners. On Sunday, elated inmates poured out of jails.Refugees could finally go home from camps across Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. European countries put Syrians’ asylum applications on hold pending greater clarity on the situation in Damascus.Regional governments including Iran scrambled on Monday to forge new links with the insurgents. Qatar opened contacts with HTS and planned to speak with Bashir on Tuesday, an official told Reuters.The US has been in communication with Syrian groups including through intermediaries, the State Department said.The Arab world faces the task of reintegrating one of the Middle East’s pivotal states, while containing the militant Sunni Islam that has in the past metastasized into the sectarian violence of Islamic State.Highlighting the fluidity of Syria's political situation, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday predicted Islamic State would try to re-establish its capabilities in the country during the transition.But he said the US was determined not to let that happen, citing US strikes on about 75 Islamic State targets in central Syria on Sunday.HTS is still designated as a terrorist organization by many states and the UN, although the UK said it could consider lifting the label. The group has spent years trying to soften its image to reassure foreign nations and minority groups within Syria.SAUDI ARABIA SAYS ISRAEL UNDERMINES SYRIAOne of the last areas to fall to the insurgents was the Mediterranean coast, heartland of Assad’s Alawite sect and site of Russia's naval base. Two Alawite residents said so far the situation had been better than expected, seemingly without retribution against Alawites.Near Latakia, a rebel delegation met with elders in the Assad family’s hometown of Qardaha, and the Alawites signed a statement of support for the rebels, three residents told Reuters.Assad’s fall wiped out one of the main bastions from which Iran and Russia wielded regional power. Turkey, long aligned with Assad’s foes, emerges strengthened.Israel said Assad’s fall was a direct consequence of Israel’s punishing assault on Iran’s Lebanese allies Hezbollah, who had propped up Assad for years.Since rebels entered Damascus, Israel has struck sites in Syria including bombing at least three major Syrian army air bases on Monday. Israeli officials said those airstrikes would carry on for days to keep Assad’s former arsenal of heavy weapons out of hostile hands.Saudi Arabia said Israel’s seizure of a buffer zone in the Golan Heights would “ruin Syria’s chances of restoring security.”But Israel told the UN Security Council that it was not intervening in Syria’s conflict and had taken “limited and temporary measures” solely to protect its security.The Kremlin said it was too early to know the future of Russia’s military bases in Syria. Russian news agencies reported that rebel leaders had guaranteed the safety of those bases. \nOn Tuesday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi Province while the rest of the country will remain mainly fair.Tonight the weather will be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi and Gandaki Province and mainly fair in the rest of the country.According to Met Analysis, the westerly wind influences the current weather pattern.On Monday Janakpur experienced a maximum temperature of 26.5°C, while Jumla registered a minimum temperature of -5°C. Dadeldhura reported rainfall of 3.1 mm, Dipayal of 2.5 mm, Birendranagar of 2.1 mm and Dhangadiof 0.7 mm. Traces of rainfall were experienced in Jumla, Ghorahi and Kathmandu.  \nMost parts of the country are likely to witness low rainfall during the three months of winter (December 1 to February 28), according to the forecast by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology.Likewise, the maximum and minimum temperatures may remain above average during this period.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events in the past decade and a half.Evidence indicates that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.05 degrees Celsius per year) than the minimum temperature (0.03 degrees Celsius per year).The department’s Climate Section issued a three-month weather forecast that says there is a 55 to 65 percent chance of below-average rainfall in the southern parts of Koshi Province and eastern parts of Madhesh Province. There is a 45 to 55 percent chance of below-average rainfall in southern parts of Sudurpaschim Province, Karnali, a few areas of Lumbini, eastern and southern parts of Gandaki, Bagmati, western parts of Madhesh and western parts of Koshi Province. The remaining parts of the country could witness below-average rainfall, and its chance is 35 percent to 45 percent, according to the department’s report.Likewise, the maximum temperature could remain above average during the winter months. According to the department, there is a 45 to 55 percent likelihood of above-average maximum temperatures in the central and eastern parts of Karnali Province, eastern parts of Lumbini Province, Gandaki Province, western parts of Bagmati Province, and Madhesh Province. The rest of the country could also witness above-average maximum temperatures.Minimum temperatures are likely to stay above average from December to February. According to the Met Department, there is a 55 to 65 percent chance of minimum temperatures remaining above average in most parts of Bagmati Province and western parts of Madhesh Province. Most of Karnali Province, Lumbini Province, southern and western parts of Gandaki Province, eastern parts of Madhesh Province and southern parts of Koshi Province have a 35 percent to 45 percent chance of above-average minimum temperatures.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short span of time, continuous rainfall for several days in the post-monsoon period, dry spells and drought, below-average rainfall and above-maximum temperature in winter—have become more pronounced and frequent in Nepal in recent years.Meanwhile, a few hilly areas of Karnali and Sudurpaschim Province witnessed light to moderate rainfall on Monday.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division under the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, there is also a chance of light to moderate snowfall at many high hilly and mountainous regions of Karnali Province, Sudurpaschim Province, as well as in some high and mountainous regions of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.“There is also a chance of light rainfall in hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki Province,” said Rojan Lamichhane, a meteorologist at the division. “Weather disturbances caused by western disturbances will improve from Tuesday, but mist and haze will continue.” \nRastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is currently in police custody under charges of cooperative frauds, organised crime, and money laundering, has been taken to Birgunj for further investigation.Lamichhane, who was arrested on October 18 from RSP’s central office in Kathmandu, was initially taken to Kaski for questioning. On Monday, he was flown from Pokhara to Kathmandu and then to Simara and transported by road to Birgunj, where investigations into the case will continue.In addition to Lamichhane, Chhabilal Joshi, another prominent figure and former deputy inspector general of Police, who is associated with the Gorkha Media Network, was also moved to Birgunj. Joshi and Lamichhane are accused of embezzling funds from the Sanopaila Savings and Credit Cooperative in Birgunj.Both Lamichhane and Joshi had previously been remanded in police custody after Kaski District Court extended their detention on Sunday by an additional four days for further investigation. Lamichhane’s detention has been repeatedly extended since his initial arrest, with previous remands ranging from 6 to 15 days.Lamichhane and Joshi, among others, have been interrogated in Kaski, Rupandehi, Kathmandu and Chitwan as well on cooperative frauds.Various reports of studies and probes conducted by police, special parliamentary probe panel, local governments and other agencies have found the involvement of RSP chief Lamichhane, Joshi and several other individuals in embezzling deposits of cooperatives based in Kathmandu, Kaski, Rupandehi, Chitwan and Birgunj. \nVisiting US Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu met with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel on Monday to discuss key issues surrounding the implementation of projects supported by the US government.The meeting, which took place at the Ministry of Finance in Singha Durbar, Kathmandu, focused on topics such as economic assistance, the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and initiatives supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), according to a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance. The two officials also discussed matters related to development, finance and private-sector investment, the secretariat of Minister Paudel reported.During the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Paudel emphasised that, with Nepal now experiencing political stability, the country’s primary focus is on achieving economic prosperity. He underscored the need for increased support from countries like the US to help Nepal reach its economic objectives.Assistant Secretary Lu praised Nepal for its achievements in maintaining economic growth and political stability, despite the economic challenges faced by many South Asian countries. He also assured the US government’s continued commitment to strengthening its economic support for Nepal in the future.Lu, who had previously visited India and Sri Lanka, arrived in Nepal on Sunday to conclude his South Asia tour. \nThe Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) on Monday filed a corruption case against Surya Prasad Silwal, chairperson of Nepal Insurance Authority, accusing him of misusing his position, submitting false documents, and carrying out fraudulent practices.According to CIAA Spokesperson Narahari Ghimire, Silwal manipulated official documents, including citizenship and passport records, to alter his date of birth, enabling him to extend his tenure and receive undue benefits. Despite reaching the mandatory retirement age of 66 on July 31, 2023, Silwal allegedly continued in his role, misusing his position and enjoying state-sponsored privileges for an additional nine months.The investigation revealed discrepancies in Silwal's documents, citizenship and academic records and passport application. His citizenship issued by the Parsa District Administration Office on March 7, 1976 indicated he was 16 years old at the time. However, another citizenship copy from Kathmandu Administration, issued on April 30, 2009, recorded the date of his birth as November 8, 1959. Similarly, Tribhuvan University transcripts mentioned July 30, 1958 as his birthdate.Silwal falsified the date of his birth as November 9, 1961 to obtain diplomatic and special passports.CIAA argued that Silwal’s actions breach sections 15 and 16(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002 and demanded the recovery of Rs3.66 million which Silwal allegedly received in salaries and benefits since July 31, 2023. The chargesheet was filed in the Special Court, Kathmandu, on Monday.Silwal, who had retired on July 30, 2016 based on the official birthdate of July 30, 1958, reportedly altered his records to continue his service. \nDespite the presence of dengue-spreading mosquitoes at high altitudes in Jumla due to climate change and the overwhelming of health facilities with dengue patients, health workers' lack of awareness and preparedness remains a concern.\nNepali manufacturers face challenges exporting goods to India due to BIS certification issues and lack of government action, leading to production cuts, layoffs, and strained trade relations.\nTrump and the GOP assume full control of US government branches, leaving Europe anxious about a new \"America First\" foreign policy, while South Asia anticipates increased US engagement and cooperation in trade, energy, and technology amid tensions with China.\nNepal's Tribhuvan International Airport will close for 10 hours daily from November 8th to March 31st for taxiway expansion, leading to significant economic losses and tourism disruption due to soaring ticket prices and flight cancellations.\nKey events unfold in a chronological sequence, leading to a pivotal outcome or resolution.\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nAs the CPN (Maoist Centre) gears up to bring Nanda Bahadur Pun, Nepal’s two-term former Vice-president, into active party politics, the move has reignited the longstanding debate over whether former Presidents and Vice Presidents should rejoin politics.Earlier, former President Bidya Devi Bhandari was said to be considering returning to active politics, but this has yet to materialise. Bhandari relinquished her party role as vice chair when she became the country’s first female President. According to Maoist Centre leaders, the party is also considering involving Amik Sherchan, a former provincial head, in active politics. Sherchan, however, said the party is yet to discuss the matter with him. “Whether people who have previously held constitutional positions like President, Vice President, and Provincial head can join active politics should be decided only after a vigorous debate,” Sherchan said.“You occupy the constitutional position by relinquishing party membership. So after completing your constitutional role, should you be allowed to return to the party’s fold?” Sherchan told the Post. “What precedent do we want to set? We need to consider these questions.” While Sherchan says there has been no official discussion on his return to active politics, Pun, the former Vice-president, claims that he has already rejoined his former party. According to Maoist Centre leaders, Pun has been participating in many party functions and events, and a formal announcement will soon be made. There are multiple examples of leaders returning to politics after completing their tenures in high state offices. But a Maoist Centre leader says this should not be allowed in the case of former Presidents, Vice-presidents, or even Provincial heads.“If we make such decisions, other political parties could follow suit, which may backfire for our party in the long run,” the leader said on the condition of anonymity. The leader believes such a practice should be discouraged to preserve the democratic spirit even though the constitution does not explicitly prohibit it. A section of the Maoist Centre also believes that by bringing back Pun, party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who of late has enjoyed good relations with former President Bidya Devi Bhandari, is trying to facilitate her return to the CPN-UML. “Former President Bhandari, who is trying to return to active politics, however, is facing hurdles, as her possible return came to be widely criticised, including by UML leaders,” another Maoist Centre leader said on the condition of anonymity. “Bringing back Pun, who was Vice-President when Bhandari was the President, can smoothen her way into the party politics.” If Bhandari rejoins active politics and becomes the UML head, Dahal might consider unifying the Maoist Centre and the UML, as happened in 2018. The Nepal Communist Party, born of the merger, split in 2021. However, Maoist Centre Secretary Ram Karki says when people are clamouring for new faces in politics, old faces rejoining politics will be meaningless. “Even a unification of the UML and Maoist Centre will have no impact on the communist movement, as neither party is truly communist anymore,” Karki said.Mahesh Bartaula, the UML chief whip, says it is up to the respective former President or Vice-President to make the call, as there is no constitutional bar. “That being the case, I also need no need for one former politician to facilitate the re-entry into politics of another former politician,” Bartaula said. Maoist Centre politburo member Yubraj Chaulagain denies that the party is considering bringing back Pun into active politics in order to help Bhandari. But he believes that should the party make such a decision, it could set a bad precedent. “The Maoist Centre should not make such decisions that could have long-term repercussions for the party,” Chaulagain told the Post. “Other parties could benefit from the Maoist Centre's decision by using it as a justification for similar moves that may be unpopular or controversial, but serve their own interests.”Chaulagain said there had been no such discussions in the party on the issue. Bhandari and Pun became the country’s President and Vice-President soon after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. They held their positions for almost seven years before Ram Chandra Paudel and Ram Saya Yadav, respectively, succeeded them in early 2023. Nepal’s Constitution does not explicitly bar a former head of state from engaging in active politics after leaving office. However, constitutional experts say this is a matter of moral ethics. “In other countries, former heads and deputy heads of state do not return to active politics. It is a question of ethics,” Raman Shrestha, a former attorney general, said.But some Maoist leaders believe Dahal is trying to bring Pun into active politics to strengthen his own position in the party. Deputy general secretaries Barshaman Pun and Janardan Sharma, who used to be stalwarts of Dahal, have now become harsh critics of the party leader. They even questioned Dahal's working style and raised the issue of leadership transfer within the party. Maoist Centre chair Dahal has long been navigating internal conflicts, using strategic manoeuvres to maintain control. Earlier, he played rivals Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya against each other. When Bahattrai and Baidya left the party, Dahal played Barshaman and Janardhan against each other, but this too did not last. During the party’s standing committee meeting in August, deputy general secretary Barshaman and Janardhan stood against the party chair. A Maoist leader said that to counter the growing challenge within the party, Dahal is considering giving former Vice-preisdent Pun an important role. The possibility is that former vice-president Pun will be given the role of senior-vice-president, said the leader. “Chairman Dahal does not want to lose the majority in the party. He is trying to gain control in various ways, including by bringing back Pun and Amik Sherchan,” another party leader said on the condition of anonymity.  \nThree years after Sher Bahadur Deuba got re-elected to the party president of Nepali Congress, the issue of who is the party’s second in hierarchy after Deuba is yet to be resolved.It re-emerged as a serious issue in the party’s provincial conference on Saturday.The Nepali Congress organised the party’s Koshi provincial conference in Biratnagar, the first of its kind convened after the party adapted to the provincial structure. Some key leaders opted out though. Among those were Shekhar Koirala, who leads the party’s anti-establishment faction, and party general secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma.The boycott of Koirala and other leaders has triggered an intra-party debate. At the provincial level, the conference is considered the second most important event in the party’s organisational affairs after provincial convention, which elects provincial leadership.Party president Deuba, Senior Vice President Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, former general secretary duo Shashank Koirala and Krishna Prasad Sitaula including other second-rung leaders of the party took part in the conference. Koshi’s former chief minister Kedar Karki, who is close to Shekhar Koirala, gave two reasons why Koirala didn’t participate. The party had not consulted Koirala on the provincial conference and he got the invitation late, said Karki, “which is why Koirala instead took part in a pre-set function in Chitwan”. Contrary to Karki’s claim, other leaders close to Koirala said that the top leader skipped the conference for other reasons. “As Koirala’s supporters, we had asked the top party leadership to ensure Koirala’s hierarchy would be just below party president at the conference. But our demand was ignored,” a leader close to Shekhar Koirala told the Post. “This is why he skipped the meet.”Shekhar Koirala and his faction have been demanding that he be given the second position after the president in the party hierarchy. In Congress, the leader who is runner-up in the race for the party’s presidential election is usually given second position. Koirala is yet to be given that position. He was the closest contender for the post of president at the 14th general convention, when Deuba retained the party’s top post.Senior journalist Purushottam Dahal, who is close to Congress, said it is not mandatory for a leader in the Congress to be given the title of senior leader with second position in the hierarchy.“But that would also not be something abnormal,” Dahal added.Earlier, Ramchandra Paudel, who lost to Deuba in the race for party presidency in 2016, was given the second position and designated as senior leader. Shekhar Koirala is now asking for the same.At present, Purna Bahadur Khadka who is the party’s senior vice-president, is in the second position after party chief Deuba. Khadka was elected as vice-president at the party’s last general convention.Koirala, who opted out of the Saturday’s provincial gathering, however, had organised a separate meeting of his faction, which was attended by municipal-level chairmen in Biratnagar on December 3 by defying the party central committee’s circular.Leaders Shekhar Koirala, Sunil Sharma, Dig Bahadur Limbu, Minendra Rijal, and Gururaj Ghimire, among others, attended the closed session.Ghimire, a Congress leader from Koirala-led camp, said that Koirala did not participate in Saturday's conference “due to the incompetence of the party president and the provincial president”. Ghimire said that although Koirala was placed second in party hierarchy in the two provincial conferences organised earlier, he was not given that hierarchy in the Koshi provincial gathering—even though the event was being organised in his own constituency.Before Koshi province, the Congress held such provincial conferences in Lumbini and Gandaki. In both gatherings, Koirala was invited in the capacity as party leader after the president, said Ghimire. Koirala also had attended both the conferences. While Koirala reached Chitwan citing his engagement in an pre-arranged event, General Secretary Sharma went to Solukhumbu for a Khumbu trek. According to the secretariat of Sharma, Khubmu trek had been scheduled earlier. But it had to be postponed after Sharma was appointed the party’s commander for the December 1 bypolls. “It is the failure of the party president and provincial president to not be able to accommodate two influential party leaders in the provincial conference,” Ghimire said. In Koshi, Uddhav Thapa, who is close to Krishna Prasad Sitaula, is the provincial chief. Sitaula himself is now considered close to party president Deuba.“It would be easier for us if the party statute itself clearly defined the role and hierarchy of senior party leaders,” Thapa said. General Secretary Gagan Thapa said that everyone needs space and respect while addressing the conference.General Secretary Thapa, who participated in the conference organised in Koirala’s hometown Biratnagar, emphasised that leaders should put aside ‘technical issues’ and prioritise party unity. “Unity in the party is essential, and necessary to bring everyone together,” said General Secretary Thapa. “It is not enough to talk about technical unity, it is a political matter that needs to be resolved politically… everyone should be accommodated.” But Thapa, who was earlier with Koirala and jointly led the ‘Koirala-Thapa camp’, lambasted the factional gathering organised by Koirala in Biratnagar. Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa formed a panel and contested for the posts of party president and general secretary, respectively, in the last general convention. While Deuba defeated Koirala, Thapa got elected as a general secretary.Now, Deuba is out of the race as the party statute puts a two-term limit on party chief, while both Koirala and Thapa are aspirants for the top position. Of late, Thapa has been inching closer to Deuba while Koirala has been hardening his position against Deuba and his Saturday’s posture could be part of the same strategy, observers said.The 14th general convention of the Nepali Congress was held in December 2021. The party charter gives each elected body a tenure of four years. But if the general convention cannot be held within four years, the charter provides for a year’s extension.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has yet again postponed the general convention of its student wing All Nepal National Independent Students’ Union (Revolutionary).An office-bearers’ meeting of the party on Thursday decided to defer the 23rd general convention, which was slated to commence in the Capital on Sunday. After several postponements, the national jamboree of the union started in September. However, it was suspended without electing the leadership following a dispute over the selection of convention representatives and whether or not set up an age bar for the leadership.With no sign for the resumption of the convention, a team of party’s student leaders, led by vice-chair Keshab Rawal, staged a hunger strike demanding the national gathering be held in December second week and leadership elected through a vote. They withdrew their strike with the party leadership agreeing to hold the convention starting on December 8. However, the party meeting led by chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal decided to defer the convention citing lack of preparations due to the need for the party to focus on local by-polls.The next Standing Committee meeting called for December 12 will take a decision regarding its student wing’s convention, according to party leaders.The student leaders, however, seem unconvinced. Rawal, who also is a contender for the union’s presidency, accused the party leadership of treating students as their slaves, who must obey them without question.“This is not just interference in student affairs, it shows they see us as slaves,” Rawal told the Post. “This is unacceptable. I don’t believe the party’s next meeting will announce the date. I will stage a protest again.” Though the party has cited lack of preparation for the postponement, insiders suggest that Dahal is worried because his chosen candidate may not win the elections. “The second rung leaders do not agree with Dahal’s selection. Dahal is avoiding election because he fears his candidate might lose,” said a party leader. Around a dozen student leaders backed by different factions within the party are in the race for the union’s presidency. Party’s senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha supports Pawan Karki. Karki had been running a parallel organisation within the union after Dahal picked Pancha Singh as chair two years back. Barshaman Pun is pushing for Dipesh Pun or Tukman Mahara and Janardan Sharma wants Madan Bhul or Narayan Khanal. Both the leaders are deputy general secretaries in the Maoist Centre.Naresh Regmi has the backing of Pampha Bhusal and Dev Gurung, the party’s vice-chair and general secretary, respectively. Although Dahal hasn’t openly endorsed any candidate, he reportedly has a soft corner for Regmi. By supporting Regmi ahead, Dahal wants to please Bhusal and Gurung to garner their support to induct Netra Bikram Chand, who had earlier splintered from the Maoist Centre, in the party. But deputy general secretaries Pun and Sharma reportedly do not want Chand in the party.The deputy general secretaries, though they are rivals, have started coming together when it comes to challenging Dahal’s leadership. “They feel that Dahal is imposing his decision by dividing them. It is clear that Pun and Sharma will not accept Dahal’s candidate for the union’s chairperson. They might even field a common candidate to counter Dahal’s candidate if voting takes place,” said the leader. “Defeat of Dahal’s candidate would mean he is losing grip on the party organisation.”Some of the student leaders, however, believe the December 12 meeting would take a decision regarding the convention. “I believe the party will either decide to hold voting or will handpick the leadership,” said Regmi.For years, the Maoist Centre’s leadership has directly selected the leadership of its student union. As many as 2,323 representatives were handpicked for the national gathering in September.However, a section of the leaders raised questions over the legality of around 70 representatives, most of whom are enrolled to various institutions under the Council for Vocational Education and Training. The dissident group argues that these representatives were handpicked without following the proper selection process.The differences escalated to the extent where representatives smashed the furniture at the Kirtipur venue of the convention twice as they clashed. A group of student leaders, taking cue from Mahara, the son of Jokh Bahadur Mahara, former Lumbini chief minister, even brandished a khukuri (Gurkha knife). A large number of police personnel were deployed at the Tribhuvan University campus to contain the protest.Right from the commencement of the conference, there were strong calls to impose an age limit for student leaders. But not everyone agreed to that. Without consensus, the issue was to be decided through voting. However, the voting didn’t take place due to the lack of agreement over the representatives leading to the convention’s postponement. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nNabil Bank Limited has introduced an ‘appointment banking system’ aimed at busy professionals, business owners, and customers who value their time and seek efficient service.This service is now available at the bank’s Head Office, Teendhara, Kathmandu.According to the bank, the appointment banking system enables customers to schedule a visit for essential banking services such as cash and cheque transactions, ensuring a faster and hassle-free experience. “This initiative is part of Nabil Bank’s continuous efforts to embrace digital banking and leverage the power of digitisation for prompt service and enhancing customer experience,” said Krishna Prasad Subedi, chief marketing officer of the bank.The system's key features include ensuring faster and hassle-free service for time-sensitive customers and making convenient bookings under which appointments can be scheduled quickly through the Nabil Bank website or the NBank App.The dedicated service minimises waiting time with professional assistance for cash and cheque transactions.“At Nabil Bank, we are committed to delivering innovative solutions that prioritise our customers’ needs. This reflects our dedication to providing efficient, personalised, and time-saving services, especially for professionals and businesses managing packed schedules,” said Subedi. \nNepal appears desperate to build a multi-million dollar cross-border liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline project and has started serious homework for the same.However, there is a paradox in the policy.Nepal is also preparing a 12-year plan to boost energy production and expand the market. The target is to produce over 28,000MW of electricity by 2035.Electric stoves are considered safer than LPG stoves as they do not have an open flame or combustible fuel source. The clear winner, however, will be LPG, as, according to experts, politicians have been lobbying for the gas pipeline without proper homework on the future of hydro and its investment.Nepal's petroleum import bill stood at Rs337.34 billion in the last fiscal, of which Rs55.61 billion was spent on cooking gas.Last week, Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari visited New Delhi, India, where a discussion was held on building a cross-border gas pipeline with Hardeep S Puri, India’s Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas.The ministers agreed ‘in principle’ to move forward with the project.Nepal has already chosen a site in Sarlahi, and the pipeline will come there from Motihari, India. “Once the project’s estimated cost is finalised, the two governments will decide on the funding modality,” said Baburam Adhikari, joint secretary of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. Nepal had requested the Indian government to build the LPG pipeline on grant. However, insiders say, as in the case of petroleum supply, Nepal should sign a long-term LPG supply agreement with India to make the project viable.If the government pushes for the LPG pipeline, what will be the future of hydropower, and what will happen to the government plan to use hydroelectricity in households?“That’s is not a good idea,” said Ganesh Karki, president of the Independent Power Producers’ Association, Nepal. The government should instead focus on increasing the country's power production and its domestic consumption, he said.Experts say reducing LPG imports by around Rs50 billion will help narrow the ballooning trade deficit.“We should not be dependent on LPG from India. We need to reduce its imports by prioritising electricity consumption,” said Karki.“Such LPG pipeline projects will take Nepal nowhere. We are spending billions to import LPG, which will obviously impact Nepal’s hydropower development,” said Karki. “If we promote fossil fuels and LPG imports, why would investors inject funds into hydro development?”The industry ministry and Nepal Oil Corporation officials say India is positive about supporting the construction of the Motihari-Sarlahi LPG project.Nepal buys all of its cooking gas from India, supplied by gas bullets.Nepal has been approaching India for the LPG pipeline construction since 2015 when the southern neighbour imposed a trade blockade.The India blockade, which began on September 23, 2015, and lasted about six months, was an economic and humanitarian crisis that severely affected Nepal and its economy.The cross-border LPG and oil pipelines were envisaged when Nepal suffered from an acute power shortage.In January 2015, the then Commerce Minister Sunil Bahadur Thapa and then Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan of India agreed to send an Indian technical team to Nepal to study the feasibility of setting up LPG and natural gas pipeline infrastructure from India to Nepal.Construction on the project began in April 2018 and was completed in April 2020.Now, with a hydro energy surplus, Nepal no longer needs an LPG pipeline, warn hydro investors.Observers say the LPG pipeline project could make Nepal more dependent on fossil fuels. In the coming years, the country will have abundant renewable energy to power the transport sector as well as energy-efficient electric stoves in its kitchens.An energy expert working on a government project, who wished not to be named, told the Post in August that building an LPG pipeline is another blunder. “Nepal will soon see a considerable amount of electricity generation that could substitute cooking gas and reduce trade deficit.”Environmentalists, too, have been saying that Nepal’s private sector is aggressively investing in hydropower, and the government’s investment in petroleum infrastructure could be a setback for them and the country.The government also has a goal of installing 500,000 improved cooking stoves, primarily in rural areas, and an additional 200,000 household biogas plants and 500 large-scale biogas plants.Nepal’s strategy is to have electric stoves as the primary cooking method in 25 percent of households by 2030.To meet this target, Nepal would need to invest $25 billion, according to estimates.According to Nepal’s National Statistics Office, among the 6.66 million households in the country, 51 percent use firewood and 44.3 percent use LPG in their kitchens.Among other types of cooking fuels, 0.5 percent of the families use electricity, 2.9 percent use dung cakes, 1.2 percent use biogas and 0.1 percent use kerosene or other fuels.Bagmati province, which contains Kathmandu Valley and has 1.56 million households, leads in LPG consumption, with 69.8 percent of the families using it for cooking.Besides the proposed LPG pipeline, in August, Nepal and India agreed on projects for an oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa, a greenfield tank terminal in Charali, and on an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan. \nThe Rs7.34 billion Siddhababa tunnel project is all set for a breakthrough.According to project officials, the 1.12-kilometre tunnel project on the landslide- and rockslide-prone Butwal-Palpa section of the Siddhartha Highway is set to achieve its final breakthrough in the first week of January. Two of the three bypass cross passages have been completed along this busy highway, which connects the hill districts of Lumbini and Gandaki provinces to Butwal and several Tarai districts.According to the project, the first bypass, spanning 151 metres, and the third bypass, measuring 130 metres, have been completed, and 165 metres of the major tunnel work remains to be completed.The project office said that 961 meters of digging on the north and south ends of the main tunnel were completed by Wednesday. Work on the main tunnel is being carried out simultaneously from both ends.“Workers are busy in the main tunnel,” said Krishna Raj Adhikari, the project's chief. The first bypass links the upper Siddhababa temple, and the third bypass connects to the Dobhan dam side. The section, notorious for its dangers, has claimed many lives, prompting the government to construct the tunnel. Over the last decade, at least 421 travellers have lost their lives, and many others have sustained injuries in numerous accidents on the treacherous 4-km road section, according to the District Traffic Office, Palpa.More than 10,000 vehicles ply the road section every day.The China State Construction Engineering Corporation signed the contract in March 2022 with a completion deadline of five years.The project is being constructed under the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) model, where a single contractor is responsible for all components, such as design, engineering, construction, and procurement.The contract binds the contractor to deliver the project within the stipulated timeframe and at the predetermined price, regardless of any possible cost overruns.According to the project office, the tunnel's physical progress has reached 33.59 percent, and its financial progress is at 32.2 percent. “As we are actively working for the main tunnel breakthrough within a month, we have ramped up manpower and resources,” said Adhikari.He said the project has sufficient blasting material in stock, and the construction company has deployed around 150 workers at the construction site to keep the project on track.The tunnel design has progressed as planned. “We have also strictly followed safety measures while widening the road,” said Adhikari. “The work inside the tunnel is progressing rapidly, but work on the outside has yet to start as efforts are underway to control landslides outside the tunnel.”“Rock shed and road designing works are also moving ahead smoothly,” said Adhikari. A rock shed is a protective structure built over a road or tunnel to shield it from falling rocks and debris. This protective covering redirects the falling material safely away, reducing the risk of accidents in landslide-prone areas.To stabilise the hillside around the tunnel in the Siddhababa area, a rock shed has been constructed over 1495 square metres, and work is underway to protect an additional 495 square metres on the northern side. The China State Construction Engineering Corporation was awarded the tender worth Rs7.34 billion. Besides a rock shed, the contractor will also construct rock fall netting and slope protection structures on the outer side of the tunnel.As per the detailed project report prepared with assistance from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the 1.12-kilometre tunnel will have double lanes with a width of 8.5 metres along with sidewalks. Around 900 meters of the double-lane road will link to the Chidiya River on the Butwal side and 560 meters will connect to the Palpa side.The Siddhababa-Dovan road section is the main link between more than a dozen districts in the plains and hills such as Palpa, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, Syangja, Kaski, Parbat, and Baglung.The tunnel is expected to provide safer and easier travel along the highway between the distrticts of Lumbini and Gandaki provinces. \nBarahi Kathmandu hosted an exclusive Christmas cake-mixing event on Thursday in its elegant private lounge, offering stunning panoramic city views.The event saw the presence of several high-profile guests, including celebrities, socialites, high corporate profiles and travel influencers who came together to celebrate the joy of the season, the hotel said in a press statement. Guests participated in the lively activity of blending a rich assortment of dried fruits, nuts, and aromatic spices to create the base for Barahi’s signature Christmas cakes. The private lounge’s luxurious ambience and breathtaking views of Kathmandu’s skyline set the perfect stage for this festive celebration. Roshan Sapkota, general manager of Barahi Kathmandu, expressed his delight at the successful event: “We are honoured to have hosted such an esteemed gathering for our Christmas Cake Mixing Event. This tradition is about more than just creating delicious treats; it’s about fostering connections and spreading festive cheer.With our distinguished guests’ support and our city’s unmatched views, this year’s celebration has been truly extraordinary.” \nThe Health Foundation Nepal (HFN), a non-profit established in 2013 by Nepali doctors in the United States, hosted its 12th annual conference on December 7 in Greensboro, North Carolina.Committed to improving healthcare for underserved communities in Nepal, HFN has been instrumental in addressing disparities in community and mental health and combating non-communicable diseases through its programmes in the Dang and Chitwan districts.One of its notable initiatives, Khushi Ba Ama, provides comprehensive support to senior citizens over 60, addressing both their healthcare and social needs.During the Annual Scientific Meeting, Dr. Shreedhar Paudel, HFN’s chairperson, underscored the organisation's achievements and outlined plans to expand collaborations with the Nepali government and other stakeholders to enhance healthcare initiatives.The conference also featured discussions on global and mental health advancements, with presentations covering topics such as cultural competence in mental health care and the prevalence of depression among Nepali medical students, reflecting HFN’s decade-long impact. \nNepal has banned additional three hazardous pesticides—paraquat dichloride, chlorpyrifos and phorate—which are not only being used to kill pests but are also being misused for suicide.“The Pesticide Management Committee has decided to prohibit the production, synthesis, export, import, transport, commercial use, storage, and sale of the said pesticides in the country,” reads the order published in the Nepal Gazette on Thursday.Poison ingestion, mostly involving pesticides, is the second leading cause of suicide in Nepal after hanging. According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 952 people killed themselves by consuming poison in the fiscal year 2023-24. “Poison is easily available in every household in rural areas across the country, as farmers often keep it in the house to use in crops,” said Dr Dilli Ram Sharma, former director general at the Department of Agriculture. “These hazardous substances are easily available in agri-veterinary shops and are not only being used in plants but also for suicide in our country.”Earlier, in 2018, the country banned eight pesticides—carbofuran, dichlorvos, triazophos, carbaryl, benomyl, carbosulfan, dicofol, and aluminum phosphide. Following the ban, suicides by poison ingestion have dramatically declined, according to Nepal Police report.Police data show that 1,320 people died by poison ingestion in 2018-19, the year authorities banned eight pesticides commonly used for suicide. The numbers dropped to 1,136 in 2019-20; 1,276 in 2020-21; 1040 in 2021-22 and 932 in 2022-23. Sharma said that traders can sell their existing stock of banned poisonous substances for up to two years, but cannot import more.“These pesticides are so hazardous that they can cause cancer, paralysis, renal failure, heart diseases in children, and deformities in newborn babies if used for a long time,” said Sharma. “Many countries, including India, have banned these pesticides.”After the ban on aluminium phosphide in 2018, people in crisis began ingesting chlorpyrifos, which is widely available on the market. Studies show that banning highly hazardous pesticides is a cost-effective and affordable intervention to reduce suicide rates. Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates. The country witnessed an alarming rise in suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year. “Restricting access to commonly used hazardous pesticides will help reduce deaths from suicides,” said Dr Rakesh Ghimire, principal investigator of Nepal for the Center for Pesticide Suicide Prevention at the University of Edinburgh of the United Kingdom, which has been carrying out research on suicides by poison ingestion in Nepal. “Many people who are in a moment of crisis can change their minds if they do not have access to poisonous substances.”Studies show that a ban on a few highly hazardous pesticides in Bangladesh, South Korea, and Sri Lanka, among others, led to sharp reductions in overall suicide rates. Pesticides are commonly used to get rid of insects, fungi, weeds and diseases which damage plants and crops. Every year more than 1,300 metric tons of 135 types of pesticides, including insecticide, fungicide, herbicide and biopesticide, are brought into Nepal, according to the Plant Protection Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.Doctors say high levels of pesticides in fruits and vegetables cause nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dizziness and anxiety. Long-term consumption of fruits and vegetables with high levels of pesticides can lead to kidney failure, lung disease and mental health problems, and can even cause cancer. According to health experts, the consumption of such fruits and vegetables may also affect pregnant women and harm the foetus. \nNearly 30 percent of doctors who completed their master’s degree and sat a recent licensing test of the Nepal Medical Council failed to score the pass mark.According to the council, the national regulatory body of medical doctors, only 175 out of 275 doctors who appeared for the exam passed the licensing test held on Thursday.“Only those who secure the pass mark become specialist doctors,” said Dr Chop Lal Bhusal, chairman of the council. “Those who fail the licensing test have to retake the exam.”The council conducts the licensing test for postgraduate doctors every four months. Those who fail can retake the exam until they pass.This is not the first time such a large number of doctors have failed to secure the minimum pass mark needed to practise as consultant doctors. Officials at the council said the average pass percentage for postgraduate doctors is around 70.“Only 50 to 55 percent of doctors with an MBBS degree pass the licensing test, while around 70 percent of postgraduate doctors pass,” said Bhusal. “What is worrying is a lot of doctors with master’s degrees are failing to secure even the pass marks.”To qualify as a medical practitioner, a doctor must secure at least 50 percent in the licensing exam. Experts say the quality of medical education is being compromised by underachievers who do not deserve to practise medicine entering the profession. “Universities and colleges must pay closer attention to the results of the doctors they produce,” said Bhusal. Licensing tests for medical doctors are a routine procedure in every country. Nepal’s licensing test focuses only on doctors’ knowledge. Some countries also conduct skill tests. Council officials said they had also planned to conduct skill tests in the past, but could not due to the lack of skill labs.“Only the National Academy of Medical Sciences;, Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine; and Kathmandu University’s Dhulikhel Hospital have skill labs,” said Dr Krishna Prasad Adhikari, former registrar of the Council. “We had planned to set up skill labs with support from various agencies, including the World Health Organisation, but things didn’t go as planned.”The World Health Organisation said inaccurate diagnosis, medical errors, inappropriate or unnecessary treatment, inadequate or unsafe clinical facilities and practices, and healthcare providers who lack adequate training and expertise are present in all countries. The UN health body says low-quality health care is increasing the burden of illness and health costs globally. \nThe Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, which has been running a human milk bank, is now providing breast milk to vulnerable infants born in other hospitals.Doctors at the hospital said the purpose of the milk bank is to save infants' lives, regardless of where they are born.“Human breast milk is required for vulnerable infants—those whose mothers died during or after giving birth, critically ill newborns in neonatal intensive care units, premature babies with low birth weights,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, director at the hospital. “We have been supplying breast milk to such infants in other hospitals, including Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Patan Hospital, Norvic Hospital, and B&B Hospital, among others.”The human milk bank, launched some two years ago at the hospital, aims to reduce neonatal deaths, which remains constantly high. Since 2016, neonatal deaths have not declined, despite various measures implemented by health authorities.According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births.Doctors say feeding low-weight babies and critically ill neonates in intensive care units can significantly reduce the risk of infections. The bank collects, tests, pasteurises and stores donor milk from lactating mothers.“The milk is collected mostly from the mothers of ailing babies, who cannot breastfeed their infants admitted to the intensive care units,” said Dr Sailendra Bir Karmacharya, a senior consultant paediatrician of the hospital. “We provide milk only to infants weighing less than 1,000 grams.”According to doctors, human breast milk contains the best source of nutrition and ensures the survival and healthy growth of babies. It bolsters brain development and has lifelong benefits for both the baby and the mother.Karmacharya said that human milk helps in reducing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal problem that mostly affects premature babies. Officials said the hospital needs 1.5 to 2.5 litres of breast milk for babies admitted to the intensive care unit. The human milk bank collects milk directly from mothers of hospitalised babies, but it collects only surplus milk from other lactating mothers, which is then tested, pasteurised and stored at minus 40 degrees Celsius. The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. The 16th five-year periodic plan, which ends in 2029, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from 21 per 1,000 live births. The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes, including hiring staff nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding has the potential to prevent 13 percent of under-five deaths. Studies show that Nepal's exclusive breastfeeding rate has steadily declined over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022, exclusive breastfeeding dropped consistently from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It stated that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), compared to 12 percent of those born at home.Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is prone to contamination and increases the risk of diseases in children, according to the World Health Organisation.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to breastfeed their babies, as studies show. The report shows that the proportion of children who are bottle-fed increases with mothers’ education, rising from 12 percent among children of mothers with no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Bottle-feeding is most common in the highest wealth quintile—46 percent—and least common in the lowest wealth quintile—11 percent.Among the seven provinces of Nepal, exclusive breastfeeding rates are the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest at 11 percent in Karnali Province, 12 percent in Madhesh Province and the highest at 43 percent in Bagmati Province.Doctors recommend breastfeeding for the first two years of a baby’s life or longer, as breast milk lowers the risk of illness in children, promotes their recovery during illness, and provides important nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nEminent city doctors and health experts today gave a call for caution, mass awareness and improved government policies to minimise the use of microplastics that can cause several health hazards, including cancer.Tiny plastic particles that are less than 5 mm are called microplastics and are being attributed to severe respiratory diseases or even some types of cancer. According to Dr Monidipa Mondal, an eminent radiation oncologist, when microplastics enter the body through food or other sources, they first encounter the immune cells. “Being micro-mini in size, they can easily enter the immune cells after which a biochemical agent called cyclophane is released. The cyclophanes prepare chronic information inside the cells. “As we know if chronic information continues to get stored in the cells, it can lead to cancer. Apart from this, cancer is also related to free radicals. Therefore, it also creates oxidative stress in the cells and free radicals in the cells due to which cell multiplication occurs,” informed the doctor.As reiterated by Dr Mondal, recent studies have revealed an increased number of colorectal cancers among people. “It has been found in some studies that microplastics could be a possible driver of colorectal cancer. Another observation reveals a link between breast cancer and microplastic. We have also heard about BPA-free plastic. BPA or Bisphenol-A is an agent that can mimic estrogen. In some cancer cases, estrogen has been found. It can, therefore, be said that if it can mimic estrogen, it could also be a possible cause of breast cancer,” she added.According to research by India Clean Air Network (India CAN), degraded plastic from waste and wastewater discharge due to inefficient treatment processes are two of the major sources of microplastics in West Bengal entering the human body in various ways. The health experts recommended stronger and improved government policies to curb the menace of plastic. As pointed out by Professor Sadhan K Ghosh, mass awareness, particularly among young students is the need of the hour. “The first need is waste segregation. Second, the governance should be such that microplastics are not created for which legislation and its implementation must be done. Also, as plastic becomes brittle and enters our body while swimming or is even consumed by fish that we eat, littering sea beaches should be prohibited,” pointed out the professor.-In Association with ANN \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nAfter a day break, the Nepal Premier League (NPL) cricket resumes Tuesday, with a doubleheader in the first match of the day between Lumbini Lions and Chitwan Rhinos while the second game of the day will see Karnali Yaks take on Pokhara Avengers.In the first match of the day, Lumbini with a chance to break their losing streak pit against the Rhinos at 9 am. With four losses in all four games, Lumbini is at the bottom of the table. Rhinos with three wins in four-match stand third at the points table.Led by Nepal’s national team captain Rohit Paudel, Lumbini, regarded as a strong contender before the tournament with the defeats in all four of their initial matches is on the brink of elimination from the playoff race. While Chitwan Rhinos, initially viewed as one of the weakest teams have won three out of their four matches. A win against Lumbini would bolster Chitwan’s playoff chances, while a loss would officially knock Lumbini out of the tournament.Meanwhile, Karnali Yaks will play their first match without Indian star batter Shikhar Dhawan at 1 pm. Yaks having lost their first two matches, bounced back with victories in their next two and stand at the 4th on the table. Pokhara Avengers, on the other hand, winning one of the total three matches stand 5th on the points table. To keep their playoff hopes alive, Pokhara must secure a win against Karnali in this crucial encounter. \nJanakpur Bolts continued their unbeaten run in the Nepal Premier League T20 cricket tournament as they overcame Lumbini Lions by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Sunday.Defending a modest 136, Janakpur narrowly held off Lumbini’s pursuit, restricting them to 135-8, with Canadian allrounder Harsh Thaker emerging as the hero to deliver a sensational final over to deny Sundeep Jora the winning run in the morning.Thaker returned astonishing match figures of 5-23 in his magical four-over spell that also included the key wickets of skipper Rohit Paudel (35 off 38), Tom Moores (31 off 23), Bibek Yadav (0) and Saad Bin Zafar (0).The clash reached its climax with Lumbini needing just two runs off the final ball. Jora, who had brought Lumbini tantalisingly close hammering 13 runs off Kishore Mahato in the 19th over, should have overhauled the target or at least collected a run to push the match into the Super Over. Instead, the wicketkeeper-batter attempted an ambitious boundary (or six) and was caught in the deep by Kishore Mahato after Thaker top-edged him.Jora had earlier escaped a run-out on the penultimate ball and was offered a chance to give Lumbini their first victory due to a misfield by Sher Malla but fell heartbreakingly short.Earlier, Anil Sah and Aasif Sheikh added 48 runs for the opening wicket to give Janakpur a strong start after being invited to bat first.Sheikh fell to Zafar (2-11) in the 5.3 overs after scoring 16 runs off 10 balls.Sah then partnered with Lahiru Milantha to share a 47-run partnership for the second wicket to continue the momentum.However, Lumbini’s bowlers hit back hard as Janakpur lost six wickets for just 15 runs, thanks to Abhishesh Gautam’s triple strike and two crucial scalps from skipper Paudel.A late cameo from Shubh Kansakar (22 not out off 24) ensured Janakpur post 136-9.The outcome gave Janakpur a fourth victory on the trot and helped them reclaim the top spot with eight points.Meanwhile, Lumbini’s fourth consecutive loss leaves them rooted at the bottom of the eight-team table, still searching for their first win.Missed chance Sudurpaschim missed their chance to go level on points with Janakpur after Chitwan Rhinos inflicted them their first loss of the tournament, winning by 33 runs later in the afternoon.Chasing 165 for win, Sudupraschim crumbled under pressure and were bowled out for 131.Sudurpaschim started their innings aggressively, with Saif Zaib cracking three fours in a quickfire 18 off 11 balls.Sudurpaschim’s troubles began when Rijan Dhakal (2-33) dismissed Zaib in the last ball of the second over.Binod Bhandari and Brandon McMullen tried to stabilise the innings but Kushal Malla (2-18) dismantled their efforts, removing both batters in the fifth over to leave Sudurpaschim teetering at 45-3.Aarif Sheikh also departed cheaply for four, trapped lbw by Ranjit Kumar.Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton then inflicted critical damage, dismissing Dilpreet Dajwa (12) and Dipendra Singh Airee (1) to reduce Sudurpaschim to 73-6.Ishan Pandey’s spirited 35 runs off 28 balls pushed the chase past the 100-run mark but Amar Routela halted the progress with a double strike in the 16th over, dispatching Naresh Budayair (5) and Pandey.A late effort from Naren Saud (10 off 8) and Scott Kuggeleijn (16 off 10) provided some hope but Dhakal’s catch-and-bowl dismissal of Saud and Tanvir’s lbw to Kuggeleijn sealed the game for Chitwan.Earlier, a half-century from Hassan Eisakhil helped Chitwan, who opted to bat first, post 164-5 from their 20 overs.Eisakhil steadied the innings with a well-crafted 65 off 52 balls after the early loss of opener Santosh Karki (9).Bipin Rawan supported Eisakhil with 17 off 20 in their 50-run stand, and Malla later assisted him with 13 off 16.Kuggeleijn removed both Rawal, Eisakhil and Malla to halt the progress.But Ravi Bopara added late fireworks with a blistering 36 off 18 to propel Chitwan to a competitive total.The result places Chitwan third in the standings, tied on points with Sudurpaschim, who remain in second place despite their defeat. \nChitwan Rhinos handed Sudurpaschim Royals their first defeat in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) on Sunday, securing a 33-run victory in the second match of the day at Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.Batting first after winning the toss, Chitwan posted a competitive total of 164 runs for the loss of five wickets in their allotted 20 overs. Opener Hassan Eisakhil led the charge with an impressive 65 runs off 52 balls, smashing six fours and three sixes. Ravi Bopara contributed 36 runs off 18 balls, including two sixes and two fours.For Sudurpaschim, Scott Kuggeleijn took two wickets, while Dipendra Singh Airee, Brandon McMullen, and Saif Zaib each claimed one.In reply, Sudurpaschim were bowled out for 131 runs in 18.2 overs. Ishan Pandey top-scored with 35 runs off 28 balls, hitting four fours and a six, before being caught off Amar Routela’s bowling. Contributions from Saif Zaib (18), Brandon McMullen (13), and Dilpreet Bajwa (12) fell short as the batting lineup struggled against Chitwan’s disciplined bowling attack.Chitwan’s bowlers shared the spoils, with Kushal Malla, Jean Nicol Leask, Rijan Dhakal, and Amar Rautela taking two wickets each. Sohail Tanvir and Ranjit Kumar chipped in with a wicket apiece.,The win places Chitwan Rhinos in third position on the points table with six points from four matches, while Sudurpaschim Royals hold the second spot due to a superior net run rate. Janakpur Bolts remain unbeaten at the top with eight points.In the earlier match, Janakpur Bolts narrowly defeated Lumbini Lions by one run in a thrilling contest. \nIndia has appointed current revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra as the new Reserve Bank of India governor, a notification from the government’s cabinet appointments committee on Monday showed.Malhotra, who has previously also held the post of secretary in India’s financial services department, will take over from Shaktikanta Das whose six-year term concludes on Tuesday.The Indian Administrative Service Officer, who over the last three decades has worked across sectors including power, finance, taxation, information technology and mines, has been appointed for a three-year term.Das took over as central bank chief in 2018, after previous governor Urjit Patel resigned before the end of his term following a difficult relationship with the government.Das had helped stabilise relations with the government while also overseeing a period of recovery in India’s financial sector and most recently led an effort to prevent a build-up of risk, asking lenders to avoid all “forms of exuberance.”The central bank, under Das, has also been seen as more interventionist in financial markets, stamping out volatility in the exchange rate to decadal lows. \nIsrael will step up airstrikes on Syrian stores of advanced weaponry, Israeli officials said on Monday, and keep a ‘limited’ troop presence on the ground, hoping to head off any threat that could emerge in the fallout of president Bashar al-Assad’s overthrow.Israel has watched the upheaval in Syria with a mixture of hope and concern as it weighs the consequences of one of the most significant strategic shifts in the Middle East in years.While Assad's fall wiped out a bastion from which Israel’s arch-foe Iran had exercised influence in the region, the lightning advance of a disparate group of rebel forces with roots in the Islamist ideology of Al Qaeda poses risks.Defence Minister Israel Katz said the military would “destroy heavy strategic weapons throughout Syria, including surface-to-air missiles, air defence systems, surface-to-surface missiles, cruise missiles, long-range rockets, and coastal missiles.”A senior Israeli official said airstrikes would persist in the coming days, while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel had no interest in interfering in internal Syrian affairs and was concerned only with defending its citizens.“That’s why we attack strategic weapons systems like, for example, remaining chemical weapons or long-range missiles and rockets in order that they will not fall into the hands of extremists,” Saar told reporters in Jerusalem.Still reeling from the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ attack in October 2023, Israel is also looking to head off any future threat from its neighbour.Israeli forces had already cleared landmines and established new barriers on the frontier between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and a demilitarised strip bordering Syria in October.Early on Sunday, the military said it had sent ground forces into the demilitarised zone, a 400-sq-km (155-sq-mile) buffer created by a 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement and overseen by the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF).The military on Monday published photos of Israeli commandos in the Syrian Mount Hermon area.Saar said the troop presence was strictly limited. “It’s basically near our borders, sometimes a few hundred metres, sometimes one mile or two miles,” he said. “It is a very limited and temporary step we took for security reasons.” \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nThe recent ‘framework agreement for BRI cooperation’ could be the perfect impetus for Nepal and China to kickstart the stalled BRI projects. Notably, the deal has the backing of both of Nepal’s major political forces, which together constitute nearly two-third parliamentary majority. China’s strained relations with the Nepali Congress, the country’s biggest political party, has been a hurdle to closer bilateral ties. While Beijing sees the Congress doing the bidding of Washington and New Delhi, the Congress feels China, going beyond the bounds of diplomacy, wants to cultivate exclusive ties with Nepal’s communist parties. The framework agreement could help change such unhelpful mutual suspicions. It was signed with the consent of the Congress. Beijing will take note. Some may argue that there is still disgruntlement in the Congress over the agreement. But then, was the entire party on board even when the Congress leadership took the monumental decision to form a government under KP Sharma Oli’s leadership?The other day, I bumped into a senior leader from the ‘rival’ Congress camp. As we both sipped masala tea while soaking in the winter sun, I started picking his brain. “The Congress is divided over the new BRI agreement, isn't it?” I asked. “These are useless murmurs of discontent inside the party,” he replied without missing a beat. “As the party functions today, if daju-bhauju want something, they get it.”Just like the CPN-UML is a one-man Oli show these days, the Congress too is firmly under the control of the Deubas—Sher Bahadur and Arzu Rana. It was the couple who dragged the party willy-nilly into the government, and they also had the final say from the Congress on the BRI deal. “If it’s fait accompli, why are some Kanresis still making hue and cry about the deal?” I pressed the Congress leader.“I will tell you in one word: India.” The southern neighbour is not happy with Nepal’s participation in the BRI. The initiative, with the China Pakistan Economic Corridor as its centerpiece, is seen as inimical to Indian interests. Kathmandu’s participation in it also threatens to yank Nepal out of India’s orbit.A Nepal-based Indian diplomat chose to put it thus: “Look how the MCC deal progressed in Nepal. The relevant document was in public domain and the compact was vigorously debated in your parliament. Shouldn’t the same metric apply to the Belt and Road Initiative? You guys haven’t even seen any of the vital BRI documents!”As the Congress leader suggested, if there are no new irritants in Congress-UML relations, the disagreement within the Congress over the new BRI deal could soon blow over. It should. The Deubas may have backed the framework for their personal goals. More importantly, it is also in Nepal’s interest. If India’s repeated blockades have taught us something, it is not to rely too heavily on our southern neighbour. This, among other things, means reaching out to Beijing to build vital connectivity projects and develop new economic links. But Nepal cannot lean too far towards China as well: We are two different societies with vastly different political cultures. This is why we must strike a careful balance between the two neighbours—and with the new sky neighbour in the United States. But this again will be impossible if the Congress and the UML continue to wield Nepal’s foreign policy as a domestic political bludgeon. Traditionally, the Nepali communists have cottoned to China. On the other hand, the Nepali Congress has been a staunch backer of close ties with India. These party-wise leanings have done great harm to Nepal. For this reason, the need for a consensus based foreign policy has long been felt. The country’s two biggest parties often (and naturally) found themselves in opposite benches in parliament and fought tooth and nail on foreign policy, particularly over India and China. The debates around the American MCC compact were rather acrimonious too. Now, by sheer luck, the Congress and the UML are together in the government. This presents a rare opportunity to build broad consensus on foreign policy. Oli has gone to China and stitched together an important deal. Perhaps he can do the same with India and with Nepal’s other important international friends—again with the support of the Congress. In this way, this ‘coalition of convenience’ for Oli and Deuba could herald an era of a more coordinated foreign policy approach. The new China deal has already given an encouraging message that Nepali political parties are capable of acting together on vital foreign policy issues.Some may reckon many aspects of the BRI are still vague and as such Nepal should be cautious. True. Yet the current agreement also gives Nepal enough wiggle room to back out of unwanted proposals from Beijing. The ‘aid financing modalities’ can include both soft loans and grants. Based on the deal, it would be impossible for Beijing to insist that Nepal accept high-interest Chinese loans. This possibility will be further mitigated if negotiations take place on a case-by-case basis. Principally, Nepal cannot refuse any and all kinds of loans from China—as some in the Congress argue it should—while it eagerly laps up such loans from the rest of the world. In any case, under three percent of the foreign loans Nepal has taken comes from China—less than what Japan or India have lent it. By contrast, the World Bank and the ADB contribute over 80 percent of Nepal’s loans. As the BRI is the centrepiece of China’s foreign engagement under President Xi Jinping, Nepal cannot reject the initiative and still maintain healthy relations with Beijing. If we can agree on the right projects, there is no harm in taking some soft loans under the BRI. Again, going beyond the BRI, the Congress and the UML should take the lead in preparing a common white paper on foreign policy—while they are still a part of the ruling coalition. History suggests this will be difficult to do when the parties are in opposition camps.  \nBritish philosopher Bertrand Russell in his famous essay about the idea of a university says that a university is, first and foremost, a place. He stresses that a university—though it is a concept, an idea, a poetics of space and a metaphor of culture and life—is, in the final analysis, a place. We should be clear about that. This famous essay in the English textbook, The English We Use, was discussed with Bachelor level students at Tribhuvan University. It represents Russell's concept of space as a sanctuary of a university. The period when we taught this essay was marked by a certain shift in educational innovations and what the university claimed “a quest for a new educational system”. It happened sometime in the early 1970s. The experiment was called the New Education System Plan introduced by Tribhuvan University. The plan, among other things, tried to shuffle or deconstruct the concept of “university” as a place and introduce an idea that used new technologies in education to diffuse certain fixed notions about it and invent ways to make educational experiments. I want to cite from a keynote address that I delivered at the 34th Annual Conference of the Linguistic Society of Nepal on November 26, 2013. “When the New Education System Plan used computer for screening applications for admission in colleges the news spread like Australian bush fire. I remember one senior citizen who turned up at a working centre located in Padmakanya campus seeking admission of his daughter-in-law at the proficiency certificate level some time in 1972, asking … ‘Sir, I want to meet computer sir because they say he has taken the entire responsibility of admitting or rejecting students’ bharnaa’”. As a young teacher at the university, I was also assigned to work as a member of that team meeting on the campus. Professor Shiva Gopal Risal had tried to seek to sort out the senior man’s question respectfully. Did the computer come as a toy to confound people, create wonder and deprive them of educational opportunities, or promote true education? No responsible agency addressed that question.A straight answer is that Tribhuvan University, the sole higher educational institution in the country, was seeking to pluralise the concept of place as a university. It wanted to do so by challenging the concept of a fixed space and substituting in its place the idea of education as a concept that could be shared across the campuses. But that concept did bring problems with it. It came as a double whammy—educational spaces lost their unique identities and failed to use the new syllabuses and technologies that were few and far between. That varied according to the nature of the institutions. However, the idea of using new technologies to teach humanities and social sciences did not work. The following period saw the emergence of several universities and higher educational institutions. Spaces multiplied. Opportunities came to open plural centres and locations to impart higher education understood under different geographical and cultural rubrics. One can easily guess that the period had brought some euphoric moments. People who took up the cudgel to start new institutional centres under this euphoria were doing admirable work. But things do not appear to have worked to fulfil the good dreams of the good people. Tribhuvan University continued to grow larger and attract more students. I am dismayed by the smaller number of students at other higher educational institutions or universities in Nepal. Sudip Kaini of Kantipur presents some important figures in his survey of students’ enrollment. The students enrolling for university education appear to go mostly to TU (more than 77 percent). Of the 16 universities, hardly one percent get admitted to 10 universities. According to one University Grants Commission report, out of more than 0.6 million students, almost 0.5 million go to TU. In terms of percentage, the rate of admission in Pokhara University is 5.56, Kathmandu University is 3.33, Far Western University is 3.06, Mid Western University is 1.61, University of Forest and Agriculture is 0.64, Nepal Sanskrit University is 0.52 and Lumbini Baudha University is 0.29. All these universities were established over a decade ago. The figures speak volumes. The onus of higher education lies on the largest and the oldest TU.Reports about the land grabbing of Tribhuvan University's central location are emerging. Reportedly, out of the 3,613 ropanis of the University's land, 900 ropanis are occupied by 19 outer organisations. (Naya Patrika, June 29, 2022). That is a stunning report. The figures and reports are easily available now. Other universities in the country have their own narratives about their lands. The land story shows the centrality of the TU in terms of its size, location and spread. It has become more crucial to address the question of land because of the needs of universities other than TU. Universities tell their stories about acquiring spaces, with the theme of politics and power, which have become an essential subject of discussion today. For instance, Kathmandu University acquired spaces inside Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur metropolis and outside to open its various institutions and departments; it is unique in many ways.We return to the mega story of TU trying to track its land, which people and institutions grabbed over a long period. Evoking Russell's idea of a university as a place, we can say that TU, far from finding its spaces and cogently using them to create sanctuaries, is fighting on two fronts—restoring ownership of its land and using that for academic purposes by making the institution stronger and more important. To take an eloquent example, the euphoric activities of good sports and the noise and crowd generated by it indicate the centrality and importance of TU's space in Kirtipur. It is natural for a university that gives higher education to the 77 percent of the students of this land, irrespective of the fact that there are other functioning universities, to find its space, its land, and to seek to function with dignity and a system. The whole thing is related to the question of space, prestige and the creation of a permanent operation system. I believe now is the right time to work on all these fronts. I want to repeat a popular Nepali expression—sabailai chetana bhaya.  \nIt is no secret that Nepal is teetering on the scale of economic fragility. Even though the government has introduced some progressive policies and economic benchmarks, the country still struggles to stabilise its economy. This is partly due to an excessive reliance on remittances and policies favouring their growth. Remittances may appear beneficial but can lead to instability in various other sectors. Such a phenomenon is known as the Dutch disease effect. In the 1960s, the Dutch economy grew as they discovered large swathes of oil deposits in the Northern Sea. An oil boom of this calibre can speed up the economic growth of any nation. However, such shallow development led to inflation, eventually sickening their economy. Subsequently, non-petroleum commodities became less competitive and more expensive. In other words, overly depending on a single export source led to the erosion of the value of other commodities. Nepal isn’t known for having oil reserves and deposits like that of the Netherlands. However, several experts and policymakers have highlighted that the burgeoning inflow of remittances can cause a series of Dutch disease-like impacts akin to that of commodity booms. Since the disease affects any economy that is heavily reliant on foreign currency, foreign assistance and foreign direct investments, Nepal, in particular, becomes vulnerable. As the gap in the remittance-to-nation ratio continues to widen, the national currency value is likely to diminish. The latest report from Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) states that Nepal’s remittance for the fiscal year 2023-24 totalled Rs1,445.32 billion, a 15 percent increase compared to the previous fiscal year. In contrast, the data on remittance in 2016 was Rs679 billion, which is less than half the remittance as of this year. Such a level of dependency can exacerbate inflation, drive up consumption prices and intensify the real estate bubbles. When the value of properties becomes far more than its worth, it creates a mass trickle-down effect that continues to pour over other productive sectors. The symptoms of Dutch disease continue to strain the Nepali economy for two main reasons. First, there is a significant exodus of labour migrants. Many Nepalis flock to foreign countries, either temporarily or permanently. This is encouraged by the government as well as political leaders. Second, Nepali consumers often have a preference for imported commodities. As the country becomes less independent, it relies far more than necessary on imports. Several macroeconomic reports indicate a negative trade-off for Nepal in its exports of labour migrants and skilled manpower, with many opting to reside abroad in search of a better life. No amount of Riyals, Ringgits, or Dirhams can compensate for the loss of a long-term sustainable development. Production doesn’t become feasible for the general populace, leading to overreliance on imports. In a nation where the balance of payments is consistently stretching towards the negative bottom, the lack of adequate labour force participation has become a hindrance in productive sectors. NRB’s empirical analysis suggests that further reliance on remittance at an increasing level can widen the trade deficits, both in the short and the long run. As consumer demand increases, the supply side can barely keep up, creating inflationary pressures and increasing prices.Further, a nation that prides itself on its so-called vision of independence is now at the mercy of remittances. A shift in policies or geopolitical instability, rising tensions within the Gulf nations, and the spread of the Israel-Palestine conflict to other nations can dramatically affect the prospects of labour migrants sending their hard-earned money home. There is no denying that remittance has played a significant role in Nepal’s economy. It has contributed considerably to economic growth and increased foreign exchange reserves. However, the concerned authorities shouldn’t forget that excess reliance on one economic sector can lead to a perpetual decline in other sectors. Given the threat of excess dependency on remittance, Nepal must diversify its economic portfolio. Concomitantly, with the help of effective plans and policies, the exodus of foreign labour migrants must be mitigated. Opportunities should be created and provided in the home country. Financial institutions that draft impactful policies must adhere to congenial policies. The need for macroprudential policies, whose primary goal is to maintain financial stability and limit fiscal vulnerabilities, becomes more crucial to minimise the possibility of carrying the symptoms of the Dutch disease. Only by acting prudently can Nepal safeguard its economy. \nTo its credit, the team of KP Sharma Oli in Beijing somehow convinced the Chinese to sign the BRI framework agreement on Wednesday. The Chinese don’t do hasty negotiations. A day earlier, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had met his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang. On the same evening, there was a meeting between Oli and Chinese President Xi Jinping. A joint statement was issued later in the day, outlining all the major developments of Oli’s trip. The much-hyped framework for BRI cooperation had found no mention in the statement. China watchers back home started bemoaning the ‘abject failure’ of Oli’s China trip. But then Team Oli, which included his chief advisor Bishnu Rimal and chief economic advisor Yubaraj Khatiwada, pulled a rabbit out of the bag.The final terminology used to describe the money that will come into Nepal under the BRI rubric has some ambiguity, as ‘aid financing modalities’ can include both grants and loans. But then, such in-between terminologies are common in bilateral negotiations where each side is looking to keep certain constituencies back home happy. The important thing is that both the top leaders of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties in the country, agreed on the term. And when it was presented to the Chinese, so did they. The ‘aid financing modalities’ do not preclude all kinds of loans. In fact, the understanding seems to be that the term means that Nepal will consider low-interest loans such as it was getting from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. That is how it should be. How can Nepal accept loans from the rest of the world but shun it from China? The Congress leadership also seems to have realised the flaw in its earlier reasoning that no kind of loan from China was acceptable. The good thing is that the agreement with China is likely to last as it has the backing of the country’s two major parties, who together make nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority. It was the differences between these two on loans from China that helped them flesh out the outstanding issues over the BRI framework. This in turn added clarity to the issues. (Some differences on the BRI persist inside the Congress, but that is to be expected in a democratic party.) Perhaps the Chinese this time thought that even though they were being asked to hurry, the proposal on the table, which had the backing of Nepal’s two major political parties, was worth signing. There are still many unknowns about the BRI. But at least Nepal stood its ground when necessary, while also not being rigid. This signals a maturing of Nepali diplomacy. After the BRI framework agreement, we again hope that the Congress and the UML and other parties can come to similar understandings on Nepal’s relations with India and the US–and on Nepal’s other vital ties. Consensual foreign policy is the need of the hour. Right now, it is worth celebrating that China, which harboured deep suspicions of the Congress, will be more amenable to dealing with Nepal’s biggest party. Their mutual suspicions were poisoning Nepal-China relations. Perhaps the long-stuck train of the BRI in Nepal will now finally start chugging.  \nWith the by-elections to elect 44 local representatives in 32 districts done and dusted, reviews and analysis of the final results are pouring in thick and fast. Given the palpable discontent against the parties from across the political spectrum, predicting the bypolls results was not easy. Leaders from the CPN (Maoist Centre) have been in a celebratory mood since Tuesday after winning a couple of important seats after years of electoral setbacks. The former rebel outfit that emerged the clear first party in the 2008 general elections had been consistently losing votes and seats in subsequent polls.On the other hand, leaders from the CPN-UML don’t appear excited despite the party winning some important office bearer positions in different local units. The Nepali Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, lost some key positions in a few units as well. Unhappy with the results, the two largest parties have decided to review the outcomes through the respective party mechanisms.One noteworthy feature of the recent bypolls was that voters this time showed little faith in the new forces, unlike in the previous polls. Traditional fringe parties like the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party and the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist) that failed to get national party status in parliament in the last general elections picked up a seat each this time. But new forces such as the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Janamat Party didn’t do well. The RSP won only a ward chair in Kathmandu while the votes garnered by its candidates in other local units were negligible. The RSP, which emerged the fourth largest force in 2022 barely six months after its formation, had done better in the by-elections in April 2023. However, it couldn’t maintain the momentum when a by-election was held to elect a federal lawmaker from Ilam in April this year. The Janamat Party, another outfit that emerged from the last general election, failed to get even a single seat this time. Interestingly, the voters also discarded forces like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party that champions revival of the Hindu monarchy. The pro-monarchy party, the fifth largest in the federal legislature, didn’t win a single seat in Sunday by-polls.For long-term success, a political party needs to have clarity in its agenda and vision, a robust organisation, and strong bond with the general people. Elections are key yardsticks to gauge whether a political party has these strengths. There is broad consensus that the public is disenchanted with major political forces like the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre that have ruled this country by turns for the past two decades. People in previous elections gave a chance to new outfits as they were frustrated by the old forces’ failure to deliver. The level of support these new forces got was perhaps not an endorsement of their vision and agenda, which are sketchy. While these forces succeeded in fanning anger against the incumbents, they failed to offer anything better. Experts caution against drawing hasty conclusions based on the results of elections held for just 44 local level seats. Yet the by-polls were held across all seven provinces, and covered the capital city Kathmandu to remote villages, hills to plains, east to west. In sum, Nepalis are giving a clear message to the political forces old and new: do not take our support for granted.  \nIn under four months, tenth graders all over Nepal will appear in the School Education Examination (SEE). This is a time for students to focus on final preparations. Sadly, hard work alone won’t yield better results when the schools and curriculum fail to cater to their needs. Every year, when the results are out, many students have to endure crushing failure. However, as in previous years, the authorities have failed to learn from their mistakes. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is making baseless predictions of a 70 percent pass rate in the upcoming SEE. How will this be achieved in a country where pass rates have for years hovered below 50 percent?Among 464,785 students who appeared in the last SEE, only 222,472—47.87 percent—secured a Grade Point Average (GPA) above 1.60, which is necessary to study at a higher level. However, 242,313 students—52.13 percent—were categorised as non-graded. After the supplementary exams, over a third of them were graded, qualifying them to study in grade 11. Oli’s forecast is only plausible if the results improve by around 50 percent, which is unlikely. The grading system was introduced in 2016 to reform the examination system, focusing less on marks and more on interactive learning. But the hangover of the old School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exams persists. While the system has been upgraded, the teaching and learning are still the same. Schools are grappling with a shortage of teachers for major subjects like Science, Mathematics and English. Rural provinces like Karnali have suffered the most and some schools are hiring under-qualified teachers to fill the gaps. With teachers unable to address their problems, students have no choice but to rely on rote learning. To cope, the government is focusing on extra online classes. But such online classes for school students hold only symbolic value. In Nepal, fear has always been a tool for teaching and learning. Most schools do not foster an environment where students enjoy learning. This mentality also applies to how the education system views examinations like SEE. Students are put under pressure to perform well, as if it were a “do or die” situation. The shame of failure scars students for life. Some private schools take advantage of this fragile emotional state of students by enforcing mandatory tuition classes. Further, as schools in rural areas can’t complete the syllabus on time, it creates an opportunity for private tuition centres to generate profit as students migrate a few months before SEE to study in such centres. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres.Schedule 8 of the constitution gives local units the authority to manage school education. But the lack of a Federal Education Act, a must to implement constitutional provisions, is a big hurdle towards this laudable goal. Among its various flaws, the controversial Education Bill, registered in Parliament last year, fails to establish minimum criteria for establishing schools. The government must realise that the basics must be fulfilled before setting lofty goals. There must be mechanisms to recruit qualified teachers and retain them. It is also imperative to update the pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. The SEE marks the culmination of over a decade of schooling. Therefore, it is unfair to blame the students who have trusted the system for long. The poor SEE results are a direct reflection of the system’s failure. Whether we have the SEE or the SLC, the flawed education system will continue to jeopardise the future of hundreds of thousands of young students.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nToday the weather is forecast to be generally to mostly cloudy in Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and partly to generally cloudy in the rest of the country.Light to moderate rain is likely to occur at some places of Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and light rain at a few areas of hilly regions of the rest of the country.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nEven as the recent agreement on framework for Belt and Road cooperation between Nepal and China continues to trigger heated debates in the country, visiting US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu has said that the BRI deal should be transparent.He also stated that before making any comment the US would wait until the text of the new agreement between Kathmandu and Beijing is made public. Before wrapping up his Nepal visit on Monday evening, Lu sat down with a group of journalists and shared what he had discussed with Nepali leaders and officials, including US priorities in Nepal, the ongoing transitional justice process and climate change. During Prime Minister KP Oli’s visit to China last week, a new framework for BRI cooperation was signed in order to push forward various projects under the BRI. After Nepal insisted on grants for expediting the projects under the BRI, at the last moment, the two sides reached an understanding on “aid assistance financing” as the funding method for projects under the framework. As the term “aid” entails both grants and soft loans, there is an uneasiness in the Nepali Congress and some other parties over whether Nepal has shifted its position on the kind of funding it wants under the BRI. But the text of the new understanding reached between Kathmandu and Beijing has yet to be made public, which also raised further speculations about its content. Lu, who arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday as part of his South Asia tour at the end of the Biden administration’s term, held talks with ministers and officials and discussed various aspects of Nepal-US ties, among other things. Lu, a seasoned American diplomat, is likely to serve at the State Department for another one year under the new Trump administration. During his stay in Kathmandu, Lu was unable to meet Prime Minister Oli as the latter was travelling to his hometown, Jhapa. But he met with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba; Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Bishnu Poudel; and two advisors to the prime minister, Bishnu Rimal and Yubraj Khatiwada; among others. He discussed with them the status of ongoing US projects in Nepal including those funded by the Millennium Challenge Nepal Corporation, USAID, seeking possible economic assistance from International Finance Corporation, climate change, and US priorities in Nepal. In his meeting with senior government officials including Rimal and Khatiwada, he congratulated them on successful negotiations with China on the BRI deal. Both Rimal and Khatiwada were part of a task force from ruling CPN-UML to review and amend the BRI implementation plan originally proposed by China in early 2020. They played crucial roles during the negotiation process. In their meeting with Lu, both Rimal and Khatiwada tried to assuage widespread concerns over the new BRI deal, with Khatiwada elaborating on Nepal’s current debt structure and other indicators, sources at the Prime Minister’s Office told the Post. “The United States is supporting Nepal in many areas, particularly in its economic development, and fostering relations with the goal of making Nepal a strong country that can make independent decisions, free from outside influence,” said Lu while talking to journalists.“We believe in taking independent decisions as well as maintaining transparency,” he said while responding to questions on how the US sees the recent BRI pact. “We have not seen the text, we have to read it,” he said. He said he would not make further comments on the pact until the details are out, “but it should be transparent.” When asked about Nepal’s departure from ‘one-China policy’ to ‘one-China principle’ and Nepal’s firm support for the ‘reunification of Taiwan’ and opposition to ‘Taiwan independence’ in the recent joint communique issued by Kathmandu and Beijing at the end the prime minister’s China visit, Lu said he was not aware of these, but commented that there should be mutual respect, as well as respect for sovereignty. Lu is known as a hawkish diplomat in Nepal, who in 2021 had warned that the US would be forced to rethink its ties with Nepal if Kathmandu failed to ratify the Millennium Challenge Corporation compact. Despite reservations from various sections, the Nepali parliament had ratified the compact. The US has been helping Nepal in various sectors, said Lu, especially focusing on Nepal’s economic development and advancing bilateral relations.“We want to see Nepal as a strong country so that it can take its decision without influence from outside,” he added. Nepal should have good relations with all countries—India, China, Pakistan, Turkey, Japan, Korea—but it should be based on mutual respect, respecting sovereignty and independence, he said.He hoped that the new Trump administration will keep supporting the climate causes. Trump is known for his climate skepticism and he had infamously pulled the US out of the Paris agreement during his last term as US president. He will again take the oath of office and secrecy on January 20. Lu expressed his excitement to see the progress in the MCC-funded projects. “We met ruling and opposition party leaders and we found a broader understanding on expediting the MCC [projects] which aims at jobs creation, exporting clean energy to India, and road infrastructure upgrade,” Lu said. He said he was excited that both ruling and opposition parties have come together to conclude the transitional justice process and on the MCC, and lauded Nepal’s recent achievements in getting itself a sovereign credit rating. “There are many challenging steps ahead, but it is impressive to see that it was adopted by consensus,” he said on the recent passage of a bill on transitional justice. Lu said he expects more high-level engagements with Nepal under the new Trump administration stating that Trump gives priority to Asia. “We had quite interesting and productive discussions on various issues ranging from bilateral cooperation, creating jobs, finding solutions to the climate crisis… talked about the development assistance from the MCC, Development Finance Corporation and recent interaction between prime minister Oli and Elon Musk,” he said. On Monday, Lu also joined the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development’s Director General, Dr Pema Gyamtsho, to kick off the ‘Green Alliance for Women’s Economic Security’ project in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region. The project will establish a regional platform for women entrepreneurs across the Hindu Kush, enabling knowledge exchange, best practice sharing, and tackling key challenges like gender discrimination, market access, and financial barriers, the US Embassy said in a Facebook post.  \nA year before the scheduled 15th general convention of the Nepali Congress, leaders from the party’s dissident faction have started exerting pressure on the leadership to hold the event in time.Shekhar Koirala, the Congress’s dissident faction leader, convened a gathering of chiefs of the party’s local units on December 3 in his hometown Biratnagar, demanding that the 15th general convention be held by mid-December next year.Addressing the gathering, he urged all the participants to start a pressure campaign from each of the local units they lead for the timely convention. “The longer the period the general convention is deferred, the weaker the party will become,” he said.On various occasions of late, Koirala has been consistently demanding that the party hold the convention as stipulated in the party statute.However, several party leaders the Post talked to see no chance of the party holding its national gathering in time. Congress, often dubbed the country’s grand old party, held its 14th general convention in mid-December 2021, and should hold the next convention by mid-December 2025 as per the party statute. If the party was to hold its general convention a year later, it should have started the convention-related activities by now but it hasn’t, says a leader.Krishna Paudel, the party office’s chief secretary, said Congress needs to settle various issues before its national gathering. He added the party needs to resolve issues related to active party membership before starting the process of the convention.Of the total 165 federal electoral constituencies, the issues of active party membership have been resolved only in the Kathmandu-4 constituency, according to party leaders.“Apart from this, the party needs to amend its statute to address various challenges the party is facing in the changing context and for that, the party will soon form a statute amendment committee,” Paudel said. “Despite pressure from a section to hold the general convention by the end of next year, the party is unlikely to do so.”The party statute gives each elected body a four-year tenure. However, the party charter provisions a one-year extension if the general convention cannot take place within four years. Further, Nepal’s constitution also envisions that political parties hold their conventions every five years. Article 269 (4) (b) of the constitution requires a political party to hold its general convention at least once every five years. In special circumstances, the constitution allows the event to be postponed for six months citing a valid reason.Congress leadership went for maximum extension allowed by the statute before holding the last general convention. Fearing that President Sher Bahadur Deuba could repeat the same situation, the Koirala-led faction plans to compel the party establishment to adhere to the party charter’s four-year gap between the two conventions as there is no crisis barring the party from holding the event.During the Mahasamiti meeting held in February, Gagan Thapa, a general secretary of the party, presented his organisational paper and proposed concluding the conventions of lower party committees by the end of November (last month). Under the plan, conventions of the ward units should have been held by the end of November, and conventions of village and city committees should have been held by the middle of this month.Thapa at the Mahasamiti meeting had proposed concluding the party’s all district conventions by mid-September 2025, provincial conventions by mid-November, and the general convention by mid-December 2025. The Congress chooses its leadership from the ward level to the centre through the conventions. The party conducts four tiers of direct elections. And general convention delegates are elected by and from among them.The organisational paper presented by the general secretary was endorsed by the Mahasamiti meeting, provided that it could also be amended by the central committee meeting. The subsequent central committee meeting of the party held in August also passed the paper presented by Thapa.Nevertheless, none of the party’s general convention-related activities have started in the lower units as per the schedule.Mahalaxmi Upadhyaya, a joint general secretary of the Congress, says that despite the party statute mentioning holding the general convention within four years, party history suggests that it gets extended at least by one year in accordance with the party charter.Several Congress leaders said that Deuba wouldn’t convene the general convention before taking charge of the government as per his deal with the CPN-UML.As per the Congress-UML agreement reached while forming the two-party government in July, Congress President Deuba will become prime minister after two years of signing the two-party deal.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli upon his arrival from the China visit on December 5 said that he would hand over the government leadership to Deuba after 18 months. If Congress follows the party statute to hold the general convention, it should take place just after a year, but Deuba will get the reins of government only 18 months later.Citing that, many Congress leaders said that Deuba will not hold the party's general convention without first taking charge of the government.“Since Deuba already has announced he won’t be in the race for the party's top position, becoming prime minister after relinquishing the post of party president might be difficult,” said a party leader.He may feel that his prospect of becoming prime minister as per the understanding with the UML might be in risk once a new leader elected from the convention heads the party, the leaders said.In the last general convention held in 2021 when Deuba and Koirala were contesting for the post of party president after the first round remained indecisive, Deuba while seeking the vote in the runoff had requested votes from the delegates saying his position of prime minister may not continue should he not remain the party chief.So Deuba will try to take the government reins before conducting the party convention, leaders say.Upadhyaya, however, differs.“The convention may not take place next year because no substantive preparation has yet begun,” she said, “not because his premiership will be challenged for not being the party chief.” \nThe much-delayed Dodhara Chandani dry port and check post project in farwestern Nepal took a step forward in September after the Sudhurpaschim provincial cabinet approved using forest land to build the facility.The cabinet has allowed the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board to use 43 hectares of Mayapuri community forest in the buffer zone of Suklaphanta National Park, clearing the project's last major hurdle. Nearly 1,700 trees have to be felled to make way for the project.Now, the project has stalled again because the board planned to pay a compensatory amount instead of planting trees on a separate land, as required by the law.According to the Forest Clearance Guidelines, ten trees must be planted for every one felled for development projects.“As we did not find suitable land to plant compensatory trees. We are making a cash payment instead and have written to the forest ministry accordingly,” said Ashish Gajurel, executive director of Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board. “We, however, have not heard back from the ministry.” The board sent its request to the ministry through the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation before the Dashain festival (early October).He said that once the ministry gives a go-ahead, the project would deposit Rs150 million, the estimated compensatory amount. “Any further delay by the government will also push back the construction timeline,” said Gajurel. The Rs15 billion project is located in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, Kanchanpur district, and is listed by the government as a national priority project.In 2023, the government approved the project's environmental impact assessment (EIA) report.Once completed, the dry port is expected to boost the Nepal-India trade and help drive industrial development in the western region.The Dodhara Chandani dry port will be the first business gateway to India from Nepal's farwest. The site is 245 km from India’s capital, New Delhi, and 1,200 km from Gujarat, which is among India’s fastest-growing states. Officials said the dry port will facilitate trade with other Indian states like Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and Haryana. It will also provide Nepal access to India’s largest seaport, Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai, boost Nepal's foreign trade, and reduce costs.Nepali officials say transporting goods to Nepal through these routes will result in substantial savings.Most of Nepal's trade infrastructure is concentrated in the east, connecting to Kolkata port. Officials say constructing a dry port in Sudurpaschim Province may open up access to more Indian ports in the future.The project is also expected to reduce transportation costs and reduce the time required to import goods from India.Dodhara Chandani inland container depot will feature administrative buildings, customs offices, banks, quarantine facilities, staff quarters, warehouses, and parking spaces.As per the master plan, the depot will eventually accommodate 3,000 20-foot freight trucks, although it will provide space for 300 trucks in the first phase.The import warehouse will be 7,000 square metres, and the export warehouse will be 2,520 square metres. The railway warehouse will be 17,500 square metres, and the container stacking yard, a large open space for container movement, will be 10,000 square metres.In the project's second phase, 126 hectares will be developed for additional warehouses and parking areas.Work has already started on a Rs3.2 billion access road on the Indian side connecting Dodhara Chandani. The Indian government is building the access road.Gajurel said that India has been preparing tender documents to start the construction of the dry port, which it is building on a grant.“Once we clear trees from the project sites, India will formally begin construction.”“As per discussions with Indian authorities, they plan to issue a tender within a month. Construction may begin within 3-4 months after a contractor is appointed,” said Gajurel.The deadline for the completion of the dry port is three years.A decade and a half ago, the World Bank conducted a feasibility study for the proposed dry port at Kanjabhoj in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, and the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board prepared another report in 2016.Three years ago, the government decided to construct the facility in ward 1 of Chandani Municipality. However, the project was relocated following protests by residents in Kanjabjoj, which is in ward 8, which was initially planned for the project. Last year, during then prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's visit to India, the Indian government agreed to build the facility.A four-lane bridge over the Mahakali River has been built, and an 8-km access road has been built on the Nepal side between Gaddachauki and the Malariya River in ward 1 of Dodhara Chandani.Meanwhile, according to Gajurel, the construction of the Rasuwa dry port at Nepal-China border in the north will be completed by mid-June next year. Gajurel said the construction of the Bhairahawa dry port is also expected to be completed by June of next year. \nNepal has been placed in a challenging Group F for the AFC Asian Cup 2027 Qualifiers following the draw held at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. Nepal will compete against Vietnam, Malaysia, and Laos, in what is expected to be a demanding group stage.Each team in the group will play home-and-away matches, starting on March 25, when Nepal faces Malaysia. Nepal will then play Malaysia again on November 18, Laos on June 10 and March 31 next year, and Vietnam on October 9 and 14.The qualifiers feature 24 teams divided into six groups, with the group winners securing a place in the AFC Asian Cup 2027 to be held in Saudi Arabia.Group A comprises Tajikistan, the Philippines, the Maldives, and Timor-Leste, while Group B includes Lebanon, Yemen, Bhutan, and Brunei. Group C features India, Hong Kong, and Bangladesh. Group D has Thailand, Turkmenistan, Chinese Taipei, and Sri Lanka, and Group E comprises Syria, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Pakistan. \nLumbini Lions in their winless journey set a target of 16 against Chitwan Rhinos in the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL) encounter at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.Chitwan won the toss, elected to field first, restricting the Lumbini to 167 at the loss of 6 wickets in 20 overs.Lumbini with a shaky start lost opener Aashutosh Ghiraiya 1[off 7 balls] in and and Arjun Saud 15[off 12 balls]. Rijan Dhakal took two major wickets of Aashutosh Ghiraiya and Unmukt Chand in an over. Lions lost their fourth wicket with Tom Moores bowled out by Rhinos’s captain Kushal Malla.Lumbini’s batting came into form with an exceptional batting partnership with Lions’ captain Rohit Paudel and Saad Zafar. Paudel made 81 runs off 57 balls while Zafar made 52 for 35 and was run out. For Rhinos Rijan Dhakal took 3 wickets giving off 29 runs. Kushal Malla and Ranjeet Kumar took a wicket each. \nMinister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba and the members of her delegation delivered Nepal’s oral statement at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Monday evening at the Court’s public hearings on the ‘Obligations of States in respect of climate change’.Speaking before the Court, Minister Deuba emphasised that despite Nepal’s snow-capped mountains and glaciers playing a crucial role in maintaining climate balance, supporting ecosystems, and preserving biodiversity, they were increasingly threatened by the rapid effects of global warming and consequent climate change. “We are having to bear the brunt of the impacts of climate change in a disproportionate manner. In fact, we are paying for a bad ‘karma’ we did not create,” Deuba stressed, according to a press statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the ministry, Foreign Minister Deuba underscored the vulnerability Nepal faced due to its geographical circumstances and relatively low level of development and made a strong case for climate justice to ameliorate the harsh suffering the climate change has brought to the lives of Nepali people. She called out the gross injustice that countries like Nepal were experiencing. “We have been penalized for the mistakes we never made, for the crimes we never committed,” she added. Speaking on human rights law-related obligations of States in connection with climate change, Deuba highlighted Nepal’s position that many vulnerable States were not able to meet the obligations under international human rights law as the actions and emissions arising from beyond their territory also had effects on the specific rights of their citizens. According to the ministry, Nepal’s position on the other aspects of State obligations regarding climate change was presented by Udaya Raj Sapkota, secretary of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. Secretary Sapkota underscored that the general obligation to prevent transboundary harm, based on the concept of due diligence, was a well-established rule in international law. He added that such an obligation was applicable in the context of climate change as well. Sapkota clarified Nepal’s position on the ‘differentiated’ nature of obligations based on treaties related to climate change. “He also called for considering specific vulnerabilities of landlocked and mountainous countries as well as overall economic capabilities and constraints, while applying the principle of differentiated obligations,” he added.Nepal also stressed the duty of assistance where the developed countries have an obligation under the Paris Agreement to provide financial resources for assisting developing countries in mitigation and adaptation. “Under this duty of assistance, developed states have an obligation to support the neediest among the developing countries –the least developed, small islands, and mountainous countries,” Sapkota said. In Nepal’s third and last oral statement, Suvanga Parajuli, under-secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, spoke on the legal consequences when the States fail to uphold the obligations regarding climate change. Parajuli refuted the characterization of the climate crisis as a “collective tragedy where no specific responsibility could be assigned”. He argued that the responsibilities could be established based on the customary international law on the responsibility of states regarding internationally wrongful acts. He said the developed countries have a collective duty to compensate for the harm caused by their historic emissions given the composite nature of state responsibility in climate change. “What countries like Nepal are calling for is not mere handouts or charity, but compensatory climate justice,” he said. The oral proceedings are being held at the seat of the Court in the Hague, the Netherlands from 2 to 12 December. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the Permanent Court of the United Nations, which has 15 judges elected for nine-year terms, handles two types of proceedings: contentious cases (settling legal disputes between states) and advisory proceedings (providing legal opinions based on the request by the UN). The ongoing proceedings are of an advisory nature, which will help clarify the legal questions posed before the Court by the UN General Assembly on March 29, last year. According to the ministry, current hearings are instituted by the Court pursuant to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/77/276, of March 29, last year. The resolution, of which Nepal was also one of the co-sponsors, requested the Court to render an advisory opinion on the obligations of States regarding climate change. This is also the first case where the General Assembly requested for the Court’s advisory opinion through a consensus resolution. “Foreign Minister Deuba’s participation at the ongoing hearing is the first-ever participation of Nepal in the ICJ,” the ministry said. “This reflects the urgency Nepal attaches to the question of climate justice.” \nThe US Department of the State has honoured journalist Matrika Dahal of Kantipur daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, as a 2024 Anti-corruption champion.He was felicitated by the US Secretary of State Antony J Blinken amid a function in Washington DC on Monday.“The U.S. prioritizes the fight against corruption, but it can't succeed alone. That's why @StateDept is honoring 10 remarkable individuals whose courage and dedication have made a significant impact in preventing, exposing, & combating corruption. Congratulations!” the US Dept of State INL wrote on X.Professionals from various countries including a judge, lawyer, professor, army officer, activist and journalist were awarded for their contributions in controlling corruption in their respective countries.Kantipur journalist Dahal was recognised for his continuous reporting in various corruption scams. Some of his works include extensive coverage to expose the fake Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and gold smuggling case. All these scams were carried out in collusion between politicians, government officials and middlemen.“This award has further encouraged me to work in the field of investigative journalism with more courage,” Dahal said after receiving the award. \nIn August this year, the three major parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—joined hands to pass the long-stuck bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act-2014. Their action was widely hailed as a big milestone in Nepal’s transitional justice process. But now, when time has come to pick the candidates for the two important transitional justice bodies—the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP)—which have been without office-bearers since 2022, the parties are faltering. The names shortlisted as potential office-bearers of these commissions have sparked controversy, with conflict victims accusing the parties of overlooking their concerns.These commissions’ role in concluding Nepal’s peace process is pivotal. The CIEDP was formed to find the whereabouts of the disappeared persons, recommend reparation to victims and prosecute the accused related to the armed conflict. Similarly, the TRC is there to investigate serious human rights violations, identify those involved and recommend reparative and legal measures. It also envisioned reconciliation, mutual goodwill and peace between perpetrators and victims. Yet, they have fallen woefully short of the expectations of both victims and rights activists. Due to a lack of competence and constant political meddling, they haven’t progressed beyond collecting complaints and conducting initial investigations in a handful of cases. This is the third time the government is appointing officials to these commissions. Still, past mistakes in the selection of office-bearers are being repeated, as a recommendation committee has been formed under the leadership of a person who botched the same job in 2020. The chairpersons and members of the two commissions nominated under him had failed to perform their duties. The names shortlisted this time have also disappointed rights activists and victims alike. Despite their repeated calls to select the commissions’ leaderships through a consultative, transparent and inclusive process, their concerns went unheeded. The list, in the eyes of rights activists and victims, prioritises controversial figures over competent and deserving ones. This leaves one wondering if the parties had a hidden agenda behind the August agreement, as it seems partisan interests have again prevailed over national healing. The politicisation and manipulation of these commissions’ selection processes will not ensure justice for the victims of the insurgency. When the parties united to conclude the process back in August, the international community had immediately welcomed the move, but the new controversy over the shortlisted names again risks discrediting the whole process, both at home and abroad. What’s more concerning is that the National Human Rights Commission, which should have acted as a watchdog in the process, is silent, perhaps because one NHRC commissioner is a member of the recommendation panel. The rights watchdog’s complicity will further erode its public trust. Justice delayed has already become justice denied for many conflict victims. For the transitional justice process to come to a successful end, top political leaders and parties must rise above petty interests and acknowledge long-term damage their misjudgement can inflict on the conflict victims who have now waited for justice for nearly two decades since the guns fell silent in 2006. If these commissions again fail in their responsibilities, it will be seen as a sign of the failure of the democratic process in the country. Nepal needs competent people in the two commissions, those with unwavering integrity and commitment to justice. We have ample evidence now that compromised transitional justice bodies cannot work in the interest of victims.   \nI had taken a short hiatus from writing this column. For an academic, balancing research, teaching, and the pressures of public commentary often means one has to step back from the writing routine once in a while. However, with the recent high-profile visit of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to China, I felt this was an opportune moment to pick up my writing again.In April 2016, I wrote about Oli’s official visit to China and the media coverage it received. At that time, while Indian media extensively covered the visit, the English-language press in China offered little commentary, although Chinese outlets did publish plenty of headlines. Despite this, Chinese media coverage of Nepal has generally been optimistic, albeit often bland and prosaic.However, the situation has grown more complicated in recent years. With the slow progress in the implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since Nepal joined the project over seven years ago, concerns about trade imbalances, debt dependency and tensions with India over China’s growing influence in Nepal have surfaced. The media hysteria surrounding the BRI, both in Nepal and India, has further frustrated both sides. Against this backdrop, seeing how Chinese news outlets framed Oli’s visit this time was interesting.Oli’s visit generated substantial and coordinated media coverage. In major Chinese English-language outlets such as People’s Daily, China Daily, Global Times, CCTV, CGTN and Xinhua, the framing oscillated between strategic cooperation, historical camaraderie, and the promise of economic transformation with a forward-looking tone focusing on development cooperation and mutual benefits. Coverage also incorporated human interest angles and increased multimedia content, suggesting an effort to engage a wider audience. Given the state-controlled nature of Chinese media, critical coverage remains rare, and alternative views are often subtly implied through language choices or omissions. One dominant theme in the coverage was political cooperation. Articles emphasised the \"everlasting friendship\" and the growing \"strategic partnership\" between Nepal and China. The reaffirmation of Nepal’s commitment to the \"One-China\" policy was framed as highly appreciative, a natural extension of historical and cultural ties, portraying Nepal as a reliable partner aligned with China's broader geopolitical interests in South Asia. This optimistic coverage may be seen as overlooking the strain it may put on its traditionally close relationship with India. However, an editorial in China Daily attempted to reassure India, clarifying that Oli’s choice of China for his first visit was not aimed at India.Another prominent theme was the economic opportunity presented by the BRI. Coverage highlighted Nepal’s transformation from a \"landlocked\" to a \"land-linked\" nation through improved infrastructure—roads, railways and ports. Chinese outlets cited Xi Jinping’s comments during the visit, underlining the “transformative” potential of the BRI for Nepal’s modernisation and economic growth. These portrayals focus on the benefits of enhanced regional connectivity, trade and investment, presenting the BRI as a win-win for both countries. However, concerns about Nepal falling into a \"debt trap,\" particularly related to projects like the Pokhara International Airport, were largely absent in Chinese media coverage. Global Times, more critical in its stance, quoted Chinese sources lambasting Indian portrayals of Nepal’s BRI ties as a debt trap, citing India’s hegemonic attitude and its failure to respect Nepal’s sovereignty.Geopolitical balance and Nepal's sovereignty appeared as another theme in discussions about Nepal’s growing engagement with China. Chinese media presented these ties as a strategic diversification, reflecting Nepal’s desire to assert its independence in foreign policy and maintain neutrality between global powers. Yet, concerns regarding Nepal’s increasing dependence on Chinese capital and infrastructure—such as rising debt and its impact on Nepal’s autonomy—were barely addressed. Tourism also emerged as a key theme, especially with the Visit Nepal 2025 initiative. Chinese media focused on the economic potential of attracting more Chinese tourists, highlighting the boost to revenue and local businesses. Nepali businesses were portrayed as highly optimistic, with no mention of potential challenges. Arjun Prasad Sharma, honorary vice president of the Nepal Chamber of Commerce, was quoted by Global Times saying, “The Nepali business community loves to import from China.” Concerns about Nepal’s potential over-reliance on Chinese tourism, which could limit diversification in the sector, were seldom mentioned. While Chinese media celebrated the economic benefits, they rarely addressed the risks of depending on a single country for such a crucial sector.Another theme in the coverage was Nepal’s potential to benefit from China’s technological advancements. Chinese media highlighted opportunities for Nepal to emulate China’s successes in information technology, renewable energy and transportation infrastructure. These stories underscored the transformative potential of technology transfer and economic cooperation, yet they failed to acknowledge Nepal’s limitations in implementing such ambitious projects. Political instability, resource constraints and a lack of capacity to absorb advanced technologies could hinder the successful application of these solutions. The practical challenges Nepal faces in integrating these technologies into its infrastructure require more nuanced media scrutiny.The lack of direct interviews or attributions from Nepali critics of the BRI or other aspects of Nepal-China relations is notable. Most often, criticism comes from Indian media or critics, leaving Nepal without its own voice. This absence of Nepali agency in Chinese coverage raises questions about the depth of engagement with diverse viewpoints.Overall, the dominant themes in the coverage align closely with China’s official stance on Nepal, but this time, there is a noticeable shift in approach. Chinese outlets have included more opinion-based content, with editorial pieces offering perspectives from external contributors. Multimedia content, such as photo displays and video features, has also increased, reflecting a desire to engage a broader audience interested in Nepal-China relations.Interviews with Nepali students and professionals and side stories, such as a profile of a Nepali professional making an impact in China, suggest a multifaceted view of the relationship, extending beyond state-level interactions. This suggests China’s growing interest in Nepal’s cultural and social spheres and deepening bilateral ties.Nepali-language coverage in CRI Nepal and CGTN, often featuring identical content, further indicates China’s greater effort to engage the general Nepali public. Although Chinese media often cite Indian media in their coverage of Nepal, particularly relating to controversies surrounding the BRI, some Chinese media cited Nepali outlets for context, reflecting their desire for the authenticity of Nepali perspectives. The increased breadth of coverage may signal the upcoming 70th anniversary of bilateral relations, which is likely to bring even more media attention to Nepal-China ties in the coming year. \nWhen student-led, anti-government protests in Bangladesh snowballed into the ouster of Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year-long autocratic rule in August 2024, many in the South Asian nation hoped it signalled better times ahead.Four months on, things are not going to plan. The initial surge of public jubilation has given way to pessimism. The interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, is grappling with governance problems, political instability, religious extremism and a fragile economy. Moreover, a series of recent events have highlighted and exacerbated Bangladesh’s fraught diplomatic relations with neighbouring India.The arrest of a Hindu monk in Muslim-majority Bangladesh on Nov. 24, 2024, encapsulates the problems facing Yunus. The detention of Chinmoy Krishna Das (also known as Chandan Dhar) was followed by sectarian violence in which a Muslim lawyer was killed and anti-Bangladesh protests in India.As an expert on Bangladesh’s political and social landscape and a former Indian High Commission employee in Dhaka, I believe it is clear that how Yunus addresses myriad challenges—upholding the rule of law, managing the economy, ensuring safety for minorities and rebuilding relations with India—will be critical for restoring democratic health in Bangladesh.A public safety crisisThe interim government’s immediate challenge is addressing deteriorating law and order.While Hasina’s authoritarian rule left little space for democracy or dissent, her abrupt removal in August has created a power vacuum in which previously marginalised political factions compete for influence and public support.This has coincided with a rise in vigilante justice, extortion and the abuse of the legal system for settling political disputes. The mob lynching of 49 people, mostly political opponents, since Hasina’s ouster is symptomatic of Bangladesh’s current lawlessness.The police’s reluctance to address this security vacuum has only worsened the situation. Law enforcement’s heavy-handed response to anti-Hasina protests generated widespread anger among Bangladeshis.Following Hasina’s fall, angry mobs set fire to numerous police stations and killed 44 on-duty policemen. Much of the police force has become demoralised, fearful and hesitant to enforce lawful crowd-control measures.An economy in crisisMaking matters worse, years of economic mismanagement and corruption have left Bangladesh struggling with high youth unemployment, runaway inflation and a collapsing banking sector. Its external debt has jumped from US$62 billion to over $100 billion in just five years, which critics have blamed, in part, on large infrastructure projects rife with corruption.Managing this debt will pose a significant challenge. Bangladesh’s dwindling foreign reserves make debt repayments and currency stabilization difficult, while also exerting inflationary pressure on the economy. And inflation remains persistently high, with essential goods becoming increasingly unaffordable for many Bangladeshis.Adding to these problems is a wave of labour unrest. Workers across various sectors have organised protests over unpaid wages and unsafe working conditions. Some of this labour unrest has turned violent, forcing hundreds of factories to shut down. Moreover, factories owned by individuals close to the Hasina government have also been targeted, including a suspected arson attack of a tire factory.The bleak economic situation and ongoing labor unrest has seriously affected the garment sector, Bangladesh’s main foreign export, which threatens international demand and could further imperil the economy.The return of extremismThe challenges faced by Bangladesh’s interim government have been exacerbated by the resurgence of Islamic extremism and sectarian violence that have long plagued Bangladesh, particularly since the return of Bangladeshi mujahadeen fighters after the Afghan-Soviet war.Though temporarily suppressed during Hasina’s authoritarian rule, Islamic extremists and vigilantes have gained confidence in recent months and have violently attacked religious and ethnic minorities, as well as sex workers. Vigilantes have destroyed thousands of Hindu homes, businesses and places of worship across the country, causing deep insecurity within the minority Hindu community, which makes up 8 percent of the population. Extremists have also vandalised about 40 Sufi Muslim shrines.Meanwhile, Bengali Muslim settlers have attacked ethnic Indigenous groups in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in the country’s southeast, resulting in the deaths of at least three people and the burning of numerous homes and businesses.The recent violent attacks on the offices of two leading newspapers, which had been accused of anti-Islamic bias, further highlight the threat posed by emboldened religious extremists.Neighbourly squabblesAttacks on Hindus have also strained diplomatic relations with neighbouring India.Under Hasina, Bangladesh maintained a close alliance with India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In addition to joint security collaboration to counter Chinese influence in South Asia, Delhi has also made substantial infrastructure investments in Bangladesh, including $8 billion in loans for various development projects.But Indian-Bangladeshi relations have been tense following Hasina’s ouster. The former autocratic leader fled to Delhi, where she currently resides, despite plans by the interim government to seek her extradition. Yunus has accused Hasina of continuing her political operations and trying to undermine Bangladesh’s new leaders while being harboured by India.The arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das on sedition charges has only exacerbated Indian-Bangladeshi tensions. India’s government has expressed “deep concern” over the monk’s arrest and called for the protection of Hindus in Bangladesh.The chief minister of West Bengal, India, called for deploying a United Nations-led peacekeeping force in Bangladesh to safeguard minorities, while some leaders from India’s ruling Hindu nationalist BJP party have demanded trade embargoes on Bangladesh.India holds significant leverage over Bangladesh, both economically and geopolitically. With bilateral trade volumes of $14 billion, India is Bangladesh’s largest trading partner and a key source of essential imports. If India perceives the new government as hostile, it could impose punitive measures that might further cripple Bangladesh’s fragile economy, similar to its unofficial blockade of Nepal in 2015 that led to a severe humanitarian crisis.The Indian High Commission in Dhaka is highly influential and deeply connected to Bangladeshi politics. A key part of its influence comes from issuing about 2.5 million visas each year to Bangladeshis travelling to India for medical and other reasons. Since Hasina’s fall, India has restricted the issuing of these visas.A return of autocratic rule?Given the two countries’ deep economic ties and geographic proximity, I believe Yunus needs to delicately navigate bilateral relations with India. He has to be particularly mindful that Hasina’s current exile in India and the ongoing attacks on Hindu minorities in Bangladesh could provide India with a pretext to more strongly intervene in Bangladeshi politics.Bangladesh’s current trajectory is, I believe, worrying. How the Yunus government deals with these heightened risks will say a lot about the future direction of the country. Indeed, any failure in these areas could lead to yet more instability, complicating the country’s long-term prospects and making it easier to envision the return of an authoritarian regime.–The Conversation \nProvincial assembly parliamentary committees are pivotal to strengthening federalism in Nepal. These committees work to hold provincial governments accountable. Even when the assembly is not in session, the committees can continue working. As the provincial assemblies cannot manage all the tasks, these committees, with various thematic jurisdiction and expertise, work by often rising above partisan interest to save the parliament’s time; they simplify work and conduct various studies. Article 193 of the Constitution of Nepal specifies that “the State Assembly may, as per its rules, form committees or special committees, as required, to manage its working procedures”. Thus, the number of thematic areas varies in each province. However, the functioning of these committees is undermined in several provinces. In Karnali, three of the four parliamentary committees—the Finance and Natural Resources Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Social Development Committee—are currently without heads. While the first committee has had no chief since April this year, the latter two have been vacant for three months. The prolonged leadership vacuum in important committees is also something that is routinely seen in other provinces. The five committees in Bagmati were at a standstill without chairpersons for more than a year since the first session of the start of the second term of the Bagmati Provincial Assembly in January 2023. The parliamentary committees in Lumbini and Sudurpaschim have been without their chairs after the formation of their respective assemblies last year. The absence of chiefs of these key provincial assembly parliamentary committees makes it difficult to hold the provincial governments accountable. These governments fail on governance, budget implementation and role assignment to the provincial assemblies. Passage of essential bills is also hampered. Four critical bills are stuck in various committees in Karnali. Meetings to facilitate dialogue between assembly members and ministers are yet to be convened. Moreover, the provincial government, taking advantage of the committee’s ineffectiveness and lack of monitoring, has been working arbitrarily, bypassing essential checks and balances.This in turn has added to the woes of Karnali, a geographically remote and severely underdeveloped region in western Nepal. The inactivity of the Social Development Committee is particularly concerning in a province where basic social indicators, such as health and literacy, lag far behind the national average. As the committee also deals with ministries of land management, agriculture and cooperatives, labour and social justice and human rights commission, works related to these areas are also affected. Despite the province’s rich natural resources, their potential remains untapped. Lack of development activities, particularly road-related infrastructure, has affected the province’s tourism prospects. The inactivity of the Finance and Natural Resources Committee is, therefore, troubling. More worryingly, another leaderless committee—Public Accounts—which oversees the financial discipline of the province, could fail to monitor corruption activities.Provincial governments were envisioned as significant drivers of localised development and accountability, but they have often become battlegrounds for political manoeuvring. Because of this, appointments for the leadership positions in these committees, as has happened in Bagmati in the past, have been deliberately delayed by the political parties. Even though Karnali’s assembly regulations allow the eldest member of the assembly committee to act as an interim chief, this provision has not been invoked. The political parties would do well to appoint the chairs immediately to stop the erosion of public trust in provincial governments—unless that is precisely their intent.    \nNew York prosecutors filed a murder charge against the suspect in the killing of a UnitedHealth executive, a brazen shooting that set off a manhunt that culminated in his capture in Pennsylvania earlier on Monday.The action brought an end to a tense five-day manhunt for the suspected killer.The suspect, identified as Luigi Mangione, 26, was captured in Altoona, Pennsylvania after he was spotted eating at a McDonald’s by a customer and an employee who believed he resembled the gunman, officials said at a news conference.When approached by two police officers inside the McDonald’s and asked if he had recently been in New York, Mangione began to shake and went quiet, one of the responding officers said at a press conference. He had been wearing a mask and sitting alone with a laptop and backpack.A search of the backpack at the police station turned up a black “ghost gun” - a firearm assembled from parts, making it untraceable - loaded with a magazine and a silencer. Pennsylvania authorities said the weapon, as well as clothing and a mask, were similar to those used by the killer.Mangione was led into the Blair County courthouse in Altoona for his arraignment on Monday night, where gun and forgery charges were read against him. The judge asked Mangione if he understood the charges against him, and he said he did. No plea was entered.Prosecutors in New York brought a murder charge, along with four related gun charges, against Mangione, according to court records.Pennsylvania prosecutors, citing false IDs and a large sum of cash that were found on Mangione, argued he was a flight risk and asked that bail be denied, which it was. Several electronic devices were also found with the suspect, and they were being examined by police.Officers in Pennsylvania said at a press conference that they were working to determine if Mangione had any accomplices and if he intended to kill anyone else. They said he had been in Pennsylvania for several days and were investigating exactly where he was and what he did in the state.Mangione, a Maryland native, had multiple fraudulent identifications, including a fake New Jersey ID that matched the one used by the gunman to check into a Manhattan hostel days before the shooting, officials said.Police also found a handwritten document that speaks to “both his motivation and his mindset,” New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said earlier on Monday.While the document did not mention specific targets, Mangione harboured “ill will toward corporate America,” said Joseph Kenny, the NYPD’s chief of detectives.Mangione graduated from a private all-boys school in Baltimore as valedictorian in 2016 before earning dual engineering degrees in 2020 at the University of Pennsylvania, a prestigious Ivy League university, according to school records. His last known address was in Honolulu, officials said.Thompson, 50, was gunned down outside a Manhattan hotel early on Wednesday morning by a masked man who appeared to wait for his arrival before shooting the executive from behind.The suspect ran from the scene and then rode a bike into Central Park. Surveillance video captured him exiting the park and taking a taxi to a bus station in northern Manhattan, where police believe he used a bus to flee the city.DENY DEFEND DEPOSEPolice said Thompson appeared to be deliberately targeted and were investigating whether others also may have been at risk.The words “deny,” “defend” and “depose” were carved into shell casings found at the scene, several news outlets have reported. The words evoke the title of a book critical of the insurance industry published in 2010 titled “Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don’t Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.”A Facebook profile that appears to belong to Mangione identified him as a native of Towson, Maryland, and a former student at the University of Pennsylvania. Photos appear to show Mangione at Stanford University wearing Stanford-branded clothing.An X account that appears owned by Mangione says he lives in Honolulu, Hawaii.Thompson’s murder unleashed a wave of frustration from Americans who have seen their health insurance claims or care denied, faced unexpected costs or paid more for premiums and medical care - all trends that are rising, according to recent data.Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, speaking at a press conference with prosecutors and police in Altoona, said he understood the frustrations that some Americans, angered by health insurance companies and their refusal to pay for some treatments, had expressed online since Thompson’s killing. But he rejected the glorification of the suspect in some circles online.“In America, we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,” Shapiro said.Thompson, a father of two, had been CEO of UnitedHealth Group’s insurance unit since April 2021, part of a 20-year career with the company. He had been in New York to attend the company's annual investor conference.“Our hope is that today’s apprehension brings some relief to Brian’s family, friends, colleagues and the many others affected by this unspeakable tragedy,” a spokesperson for UnitedHealth said. \nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been banned from leaving the country over a failed attempt at imposing martial law, a justice ministry official said on Monday, amid growing calls for him to step down and a deepening leadership crisis.Yoon has apologised for the botched attempt and said he was leaving his political and legal fate to his ruling People Power Party (PPP) but has not resigned. He has become the subject of criminal investigation, according to local media reports.On Monday, the defence ministry said Yoon was still legally commander in chief, but growing dissent among senior military officers against the president has thrown into question his grip on power.Oh Dong-woon, the head of the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, said he had barred Yoon from foreign travel when asked at a parliament hearing what actions have been taken against the president.A justice ministry official, Bae Sang-up, told the committee the travel ban order had been executed.The panel was established in 2021 to investigate high-ranking officials including the president and their family members but it does not have authority to prosecute the president. Instead, it is by law required to refer the matter to the prosecutors’ office.While Yoon survived an impeachment vote in parliament on Saturday, his party’s decision to delegate presidential authority to the prime minister has plunged the key US ally into a constitutional crisis.Yoon has refused calls, including some from within his own ruling party, to resign, but his future looked more uncertain over the weekend when Yonhap news agency reported he was under criminal investigation for alleged treason.Prosecutors on Sunday arrested ex-defence minister Kim Yong-hyun over his alleged role in the declaration of martial law on December 3, Yonhap reported.Yoon gave the military sweeping emergency powers on December 3 to root out what he called “anti-state forces” and obstructionist political opponents. He rescinded the order six hours later after parliament voted against the decree.Amid the backlash, multiple military officials, including the acting defence minister, have said they would not follow any new order to impose martial law again.The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) has called for Yoon to be stripped of his authority over the military. The DP has also demanded the arrest of Yoon and any military officials implicated in the martial law fiasco.The head of a task force established by Yoon's party to handle his eventual and “orderly” resignation, Lee Yang-soo, said the team would consider all options and timing for the president’s early departure “without any limitations”.On Sunday, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said the president would be excluded from foreign and other state affairs, and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would manage government affairs.That proposal has drawn criticism from the opposition, which says it is unconstitutional. It says Yoon must be impeached or resign and face legal prosecution, and plans to table another impeachment bill on Saturday.Chang Young-soo, a professor at the School of Law at Korea University, said the president was able to delegate authority to the prime minister, especially his control of the military, but there is debate on whether the prime minister has the authority to act as head of state on diplomatic matters.“Also, unlike a US vice president, a South Korean prime minister is not elected, which means democratic legitimacy is weak. So it will also be an issue how long this system can go on,” he said.MILITARY BACKLASHOpposition leader Lee Jae-myung said on Monday the political crisis threatened to cause irreversible harm to Asia's fourth-largest economy, a major global supplier of memory chips.South Korea’s finance ministry and regulators said they would make all-out efforts to stabilise financial markets by deploying contingency plans and boosting liquidity by end-December.In the latest sign of dissent within military ranks, the commander of South Korea’s special forces said he was ordered to send his troops into parliament last week to stop a vote to reject martial law.Colonel Kim Hyun-tae, the commanding officer of the 707th Special Missions Group, said he took responsibility for his troops’ actions but he was acting under orders from then defence minister Kim Yong-hyun.“We were all victims who were used by the former defence minister,” he told reporters outside the defence ministry.He said he had not told the military about his plan to speak to the media out of fear he might be stopped.Yoon’s decision to declare emergency rule stirred protests on the streets and raised alarm among Seoul’s allies.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin scrapped plans to travel to South Korea and Secretary of State Antony Blinken called his South Korean counterpart, saying he expected the democratic process to prevail.The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.The turmoil in Seoul comes at an important geopolitical moment in the region, with North Korea reportedly sending troops to help Russia’s war against Ukraine amid growing military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.South Korean foreign minister Cho Tae-yul told ministry officials: “We must also be unremitting in our efforts to restore the trust of our partners and once again measure up to the expectations of the international community towards Korea.” \nOusted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s prime minister said he had agreed on Monday to hand power to the rebel-led Salvation Government, a day after the rebels seized the capital Damascus and Assad fled to Russia.The imminent transfer of power follows 13 years of civil war and the end to more than 50 years of brutal rule by the Assad family, leaving Syrians at home and millions of refugees abroad hopeful yet deeply uncertain about their country's future.Oil prices rose more than 1% on Monday, partly on concerns that uncertainty in Syria, which is not a major oil producer, could raise regional instability, analysts said.Damascus stirred to life on Monday, with traffic returning to the streets and people venturing out after a nighttime curfew, but most shops remained shut.Fighters from the remote countryside milled about in the capital, clustering in the central Umayyad Square.“We had a purpose and a goal and now we are done with it. We want the state and security forces to be in charge,” said Firdous Omar, who said he had battled the Assad government since 2011 and now looked forward to resuming work as a farmer in provincial Idlib.Assad’s prime minister, Mohammed Jalali, told Al Arabiya TV he had agreed to hand power to the Salvation Government, an administration based in rebel-held territory in northwest Syria.He said the handover could take days to carry out.The main rebel commander Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, met overnight with Jalali and Vice President Faisal Mekdad to discuss a transitional government, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. Golani has vowed to rebuild Syria.Al Jazeera television reported the transitional authority would be headed by Mohamed al-Bashir, who ran the Salvation Government before the 12-day lightning offensive swept into Damascus.The advance of a militia alliance spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, was a generational turning point for the Middle East.The rebel sweep ended a war that killed hundreds of thousands, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble, the countryside depopulated and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions.QATAR OPENS CONTACTSAssad’s police state was known as one of the harshest in the Middle East, holding hundreds of thousands of political prisoners. On Sunday, elated inmates poured out of jails.Refugees could finally go home from camps across Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. European countries put Syrians’ asylum applications on hold pending greater clarity on the situation in Damascus.Regional governments including Iran scrambled on Monday to forge new links with the insurgents. Qatar opened contacts with HTS and planned to speak with Bashir on Tuesday, an official told Reuters.The US has been in communication with Syrian groups including through intermediaries, the State Department said.The Arab world faces the task of reintegrating one of the Middle East’s pivotal states, while containing the militant Sunni Islam that has in the past metastasized into the sectarian violence of Islamic State.Highlighting the fluidity of Syria's political situation, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday predicted Islamic State would try to re-establish its capabilities in the country during the transition.But he said the US was determined not to let that happen, citing US strikes on about 75 Islamic State targets in central Syria on Sunday.HTS is still designated as a terrorist organization by many states and the UN, although the UK said it could consider lifting the label. The group has spent years trying to soften its image to reassure foreign nations and minority groups within Syria.SAUDI ARABIA SAYS ISRAEL UNDERMINES SYRIAOne of the last areas to fall to the insurgents was the Mediterranean coast, heartland of Assad’s Alawite sect and site of Russia's naval base. Two Alawite residents said so far the situation had been better than expected, seemingly without retribution against Alawites.Near Latakia, a rebel delegation met with elders in the Assad family’s hometown of Qardaha, and the Alawites signed a statement of support for the rebels, three residents told Reuters.Assad’s fall wiped out one of the main bastions from which Iran and Russia wielded regional power. Turkey, long aligned with Assad’s foes, emerges strengthened.Israel said Assad’s fall was a direct consequence of Israel’s punishing assault on Iran’s Lebanese allies Hezbollah, who had propped up Assad for years.Since rebels entered Damascus, Israel has struck sites in Syria including bombing at least three major Syrian army air bases on Monday. Israeli officials said those airstrikes would carry on for days to keep Assad’s former arsenal of heavy weapons out of hostile hands.Saudi Arabia said Israel’s seizure of a buffer zone in the Golan Heights would “ruin Syria’s chances of restoring security.”But Israel told the UN Security Council that it was not intervening in Syria’s conflict and had taken “limited and temporary measures” solely to protect its security.The Kremlin said it was too early to know the future of Russia’s military bases in Syria. Russian news agencies reported that rebel leaders had guaranteed the safety of those bases. \nOn Tuesday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi Province while the rest of the country will remain mainly fair.Tonight the weather will be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi and Gandaki Province and mainly fair in the rest of the country.According to Met Analysis, the westerly wind influences the current weather pattern.On Monday Janakpur experienced a maximum temperature of 26.5°C, while Jumla registered a minimum temperature of -5°C. Dadeldhura reported rainfall of 3.1 mm, Dipayal of 2.5 mm, Birendranagar of 2.1 mm and Dhangadiof 0.7 mm. Traces of rainfall were experienced in Jumla, Ghorahi and Kathmandu.  \nMost parts of the country are likely to witness low rainfall during the three months of winter (December 1 to February 28), according to the forecast by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology.Likewise, the maximum and minimum temperatures may remain above average during this period.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events in the past decade and a half.Evidence indicates that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.05 degrees Celsius per year) than the minimum temperature (0.03 degrees Celsius per year).The department’s Climate Section issued a three-month weather forecast that says there is a 55 to 65 percent chance of below-average rainfall in the southern parts of Koshi Province and eastern parts of Madhesh Province. There is a 45 to 55 percent chance of below-average rainfall in southern parts of Sudurpaschim Province, Karnali, a few areas of Lumbini, eastern and southern parts of Gandaki, Bagmati, western parts of Madhesh and western parts of Koshi Province. The remaining parts of the country could witness below-average rainfall, and its chance is 35 percent to 45 percent, according to the department’s report.Likewise, the maximum temperature could remain above average during the winter months. According to the department, there is a 45 to 55 percent likelihood of above-average maximum temperatures in the central and eastern parts of Karnali Province, eastern parts of Lumbini Province, Gandaki Province, western parts of Bagmati Province, and Madhesh Province. The rest of the country could also witness above-average maximum temperatures.Minimum temperatures are likely to stay above average from December to February. According to the Met Department, there is a 55 to 65 percent chance of minimum temperatures remaining above average in most parts of Bagmati Province and western parts of Madhesh Province. Most of Karnali Province, Lumbini Province, southern and western parts of Gandaki Province, eastern parts of Madhesh Province and southern parts of Koshi Province have a 35 percent to 45 percent chance of above-average minimum temperatures.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short span of time, continuous rainfall for several days in the post-monsoon period, dry spells and drought, below-average rainfall and above-maximum temperature in winter—have become more pronounced and frequent in Nepal in recent years.Meanwhile, a few hilly areas of Karnali and Sudurpaschim Province witnessed light to moderate rainfall on Monday.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division under the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, there is also a chance of light to moderate snowfall at many high hilly and mountainous regions of Karnali Province, Sudurpaschim Province, as well as in some high and mountainous regions of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.“There is also a chance of light rainfall in hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki Province,” said Rojan Lamichhane, a meteorologist at the division. “Weather disturbances caused by western disturbances will improve from Tuesday, but mist and haze will continue.” \nRastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is currently in police custody under charges of cooperative frauds, organised crime, and money laundering, has been taken to Birgunj for further investigation.Lamichhane, who was arrested on October 18 from RSP’s central office in Kathmandu, was initially taken to Kaski for questioning. On Monday, he was flown from Pokhara to Kathmandu and then to Simara and transported by road to Birgunj, where investigations into the case will continue.In addition to Lamichhane, Chhabilal Joshi, another prominent figure and former deputy inspector general of Police, who is associated with the Gorkha Media Network, was also moved to Birgunj. Joshi and Lamichhane are accused of embezzling funds from the Sanopaila Savings and Credit Cooperative in Birgunj.Both Lamichhane and Joshi had previously been remanded in police custody after Kaski District Court extended their detention on Sunday by an additional four days for further investigation. Lamichhane’s detention has been repeatedly extended since his initial arrest, with previous remands ranging from 6 to 15 days.Lamichhane and Joshi, among others, have been interrogated in Kaski, Rupandehi, Kathmandu and Chitwan as well on cooperative frauds.Various reports of studies and probes conducted by police, special parliamentary probe panel, local governments and other agencies have found the involvement of RSP chief Lamichhane, Joshi and several other individuals in embezzling deposits of cooperatives based in Kathmandu, Kaski, Rupandehi, Chitwan and Birgunj. \nVisiting US Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu met with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel on Monday to discuss key issues surrounding the implementation of projects supported by the US government.The meeting, which took place at the Ministry of Finance in Singha Durbar, Kathmandu, focused on topics such as economic assistance, the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and initiatives supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), according to a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance. The two officials also discussed matters related to development, finance and private-sector investment, the secretariat of Minister Paudel reported.During the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Paudel emphasised that, with Nepal now experiencing political stability, the country’s primary focus is on achieving economic prosperity. He underscored the need for increased support from countries like the US to help Nepal reach its economic objectives.Assistant Secretary Lu praised Nepal for its achievements in maintaining economic growth and political stability, despite the economic challenges faced by many South Asian countries. He also assured the US government’s continued commitment to strengthening its economic support for Nepal in the future.Lu, who had previously visited India and Sri Lanka, arrived in Nepal on Sunday to conclude his South Asia tour. \nThe Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) on Monday filed a corruption case against Surya Prasad Silwal, chairperson of Nepal Insurance Authority, accusing him of misusing his position, submitting false documents, and carrying out fraudulent practices.According to CIAA Spokesperson Narahari Ghimire, Silwal manipulated official documents, including citizenship and passport records, to alter his date of birth, enabling him to extend his tenure and receive undue benefits. Despite reaching the mandatory retirement age of 66 on July 31, 2023, Silwal allegedly continued in his role, misusing his position and enjoying state-sponsored privileges for an additional nine months.The investigation revealed discrepancies in Silwal's documents, citizenship and academic records and passport application. His citizenship issued by the Parsa District Administration Office on March 7, 1976 indicated he was 16 years old at the time. However, another citizenship copy from Kathmandu Administration, issued on April 30, 2009, recorded the date of his birth as November 8, 1959. Similarly, Tribhuvan University transcripts mentioned July 30, 1958 as his birthdate.Silwal falsified the date of his birth as November 9, 1961 to obtain diplomatic and special passports.CIAA argued that Silwal’s actions breach sections 15 and 16(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002 and demanded the recovery of Rs3.66 million which Silwal allegedly received in salaries and benefits since July 31, 2023. The chargesheet was filed in the Special Court, Kathmandu, on Monday.Silwal, who had retired on July 30, 2016 based on the official birthdate of July 30, 1958, reportedly altered his records to continue his service. \nDespite the presence of dengue-spreading mosquitoes at high altitudes in Jumla due to climate change and the overwhelming of health facilities with dengue patients, health workers' lack of awareness and preparedness remains a concern.\nNepali manufacturers face challenges exporting goods to India due to BIS certification issues and lack of government action, leading to production cuts, layoffs, and strained trade relations.\nTrump and the GOP assume full control of US government branches, leaving Europe anxious about a new \"America First\" foreign policy, while South Asia anticipates increased US engagement and cooperation in trade, energy, and technology amid tensions with China.\nNepal's Tribhuvan International Airport will close for 10 hours daily from November 8th to March 31st for taxiway expansion, leading to significant economic losses and tourism disruption due to soaring ticket prices and flight cancellations.\nKey events unfold in a chronological sequence, leading to a pivotal outcome or resolution.\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nAs the CPN (Maoist Centre) gears up to bring Nanda Bahadur Pun, Nepal’s two-term former Vice-president, into active party politics, the move has reignited the longstanding debate over whether former Presidents and Vice Presidents should rejoin politics.Earlier, former President Bidya Devi Bhandari was said to be considering returning to active politics, but this has yet to materialise. Bhandari relinquished her party role as vice chair when she became the country’s first female President. According to Maoist Centre leaders, the party is also considering involving Amik Sherchan, a former provincial head, in active politics. Sherchan, however, said the party is yet to discuss the matter with him. “Whether people who have previously held constitutional positions like President, Vice President, and Provincial head can join active politics should be decided only after a vigorous debate,” Sherchan said.“You occupy the constitutional position by relinquishing party membership. So after completing your constitutional role, should you be allowed to return to the party’s fold?” Sherchan told the Post. “What precedent do we want to set? We need to consider these questions.” While Sherchan says there has been no official discussion on his return to active politics, Pun, the former Vice-president, claims that he has already rejoined his former party. According to Maoist Centre leaders, Pun has been participating in many party functions and events, and a formal announcement will soon be made. There are multiple examples of leaders returning to politics after completing their tenures in high state offices. But a Maoist Centre leader says this should not be allowed in the case of former Presidents, Vice-presidents, or even Provincial heads.“If we make such decisions, other political parties could follow suit, which may backfire for our party in the long run,” the leader said on the condition of anonymity. The leader believes such a practice should be discouraged to preserve the democratic spirit even though the constitution does not explicitly prohibit it. A section of the Maoist Centre also believes that by bringing back Pun, party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who of late has enjoyed good relations with former President Bidya Devi Bhandari, is trying to facilitate her return to the CPN-UML. “Former President Bhandari, who is trying to return to active politics, however, is facing hurdles, as her possible return came to be widely criticised, including by UML leaders,” another Maoist Centre leader said on the condition of anonymity. “Bringing back Pun, who was Vice-President when Bhandari was the President, can smoothen her way into the party politics.” If Bhandari rejoins active politics and becomes the UML head, Dahal might consider unifying the Maoist Centre and the UML, as happened in 2018. The Nepal Communist Party, born of the merger, split in 2021. However, Maoist Centre Secretary Ram Karki says when people are clamouring for new faces in politics, old faces rejoining politics will be meaningless. “Even a unification of the UML and Maoist Centre will have no impact on the communist movement, as neither party is truly communist anymore,” Karki said.Mahesh Bartaula, the UML chief whip, says it is up to the respective former President or Vice-President to make the call, as there is no constitutional bar. “That being the case, I also need no need for one former politician to facilitate the re-entry into politics of another former politician,” Bartaula said. Maoist Centre politburo member Yubraj Chaulagain denies that the party is considering bringing back Pun into active politics in order to help Bhandari. But he believes that should the party make such a decision, it could set a bad precedent. “The Maoist Centre should not make such decisions that could have long-term repercussions for the party,” Chaulagain told the Post. “Other parties could benefit from the Maoist Centre's decision by using it as a justification for similar moves that may be unpopular or controversial, but serve their own interests.”Chaulagain said there had been no such discussions in the party on the issue. Bhandari and Pun became the country’s President and Vice-President soon after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. They held their positions for almost seven years before Ram Chandra Paudel and Ram Saya Yadav, respectively, succeeded them in early 2023. Nepal’s Constitution does not explicitly bar a former head of state from engaging in active politics after leaving office. However, constitutional experts say this is a matter of moral ethics. “In other countries, former heads and deputy heads of state do not return to active politics. It is a question of ethics,” Raman Shrestha, a former attorney general, said.But some Maoist leaders believe Dahal is trying to bring Pun into active politics to strengthen his own position in the party. Deputy general secretaries Barshaman Pun and Janardan Sharma, who used to be stalwarts of Dahal, have now become harsh critics of the party leader. They even questioned Dahal's working style and raised the issue of leadership transfer within the party. Maoist Centre chair Dahal has long been navigating internal conflicts, using strategic manoeuvres to maintain control. Earlier, he played rivals Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya against each other. When Bahattrai and Baidya left the party, Dahal played Barshaman and Janardhan against each other, but this too did not last. During the party’s standing committee meeting in August, deputy general secretary Barshaman and Janardhan stood against the party chair. A Maoist leader said that to counter the growing challenge within the party, Dahal is considering giving former Vice-preisdent Pun an important role. The possibility is that former vice-president Pun will be given the role of senior-vice-president, said the leader. “Chairman Dahal does not want to lose the majority in the party. He is trying to gain control in various ways, including by bringing back Pun and Amik Sherchan,” another party leader said on the condition of anonymity.  \nThree years after Sher Bahadur Deuba got re-elected to the party president of Nepali Congress, the issue of who is the party’s second in hierarchy after Deuba is yet to be resolved.It re-emerged as a serious issue in the party’s provincial conference on Saturday.The Nepali Congress organised the party’s Koshi provincial conference in Biratnagar, the first of its kind convened after the party adapted to the provincial structure. Some key leaders opted out though. Among those were Shekhar Koirala, who leads the party’s anti-establishment faction, and party general secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma.The boycott of Koirala and other leaders has triggered an intra-party debate. At the provincial level, the conference is considered the second most important event in the party’s organisational affairs after provincial convention, which elects provincial leadership.Party president Deuba, Senior Vice President Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, former general secretary duo Shashank Koirala and Krishna Prasad Sitaula including other second-rung leaders of the party took part in the conference. Koshi’s former chief minister Kedar Karki, who is close to Shekhar Koirala, gave two reasons why Koirala didn’t participate. The party had not consulted Koirala on the provincial conference and he got the invitation late, said Karki, “which is why Koirala instead took part in a pre-set function in Chitwan”. Contrary to Karki’s claim, other leaders close to Koirala said that the top leader skipped the conference for other reasons. “As Koirala’s supporters, we had asked the top party leadership to ensure Koirala’s hierarchy would be just below party president at the conference. But our demand was ignored,” a leader close to Shekhar Koirala told the Post. “This is why he skipped the meet.”Shekhar Koirala and his faction have been demanding that he be given the second position after the president in the party hierarchy. In Congress, the leader who is runner-up in the race for the party’s presidential election is usually given second position. Koirala is yet to be given that position. He was the closest contender for the post of president at the 14th general convention, when Deuba retained the party’s top post.Senior journalist Purushottam Dahal, who is close to Congress, said it is not mandatory for a leader in the Congress to be given the title of senior leader with second position in the hierarchy.“But that would also not be something abnormal,” Dahal added.Earlier, Ramchandra Paudel, who lost to Deuba in the race for party presidency in 2016, was given the second position and designated as senior leader. Shekhar Koirala is now asking for the same.At present, Purna Bahadur Khadka who is the party’s senior vice-president, is in the second position after party chief Deuba. Khadka was elected as vice-president at the party’s last general convention.Koirala, who opted out of the Saturday’s provincial gathering, however, had organised a separate meeting of his faction, which was attended by municipal-level chairmen in Biratnagar on December 3 by defying the party central committee’s circular.Leaders Shekhar Koirala, Sunil Sharma, Dig Bahadur Limbu, Minendra Rijal, and Gururaj Ghimire, among others, attended the closed session.Ghimire, a Congress leader from Koirala-led camp, said that Koirala did not participate in Saturday's conference “due to the incompetence of the party president and the provincial president”. Ghimire said that although Koirala was placed second in party hierarchy in the two provincial conferences organised earlier, he was not given that hierarchy in the Koshi provincial gathering—even though the event was being organised in his own constituency.Before Koshi province, the Congress held such provincial conferences in Lumbini and Gandaki. In both gatherings, Koirala was invited in the capacity as party leader after the president, said Ghimire. Koirala also had attended both the conferences. While Koirala reached Chitwan citing his engagement in an pre-arranged event, General Secretary Sharma went to Solukhumbu for a Khumbu trek. According to the secretariat of Sharma, Khubmu trek had been scheduled earlier. But it had to be postponed after Sharma was appointed the party’s commander for the December 1 bypolls. “It is the failure of the party president and provincial president to not be able to accommodate two influential party leaders in the provincial conference,” Ghimire said. In Koshi, Uddhav Thapa, who is close to Krishna Prasad Sitaula, is the provincial chief. Sitaula himself is now considered close to party president Deuba.“It would be easier for us if the party statute itself clearly defined the role and hierarchy of senior party leaders,” Thapa said. General Secretary Gagan Thapa said that everyone needs space and respect while addressing the conference.General Secretary Thapa, who participated in the conference organised in Koirala’s hometown Biratnagar, emphasised that leaders should put aside ‘technical issues’ and prioritise party unity. “Unity in the party is essential, and necessary to bring everyone together,” said General Secretary Thapa. “It is not enough to talk about technical unity, it is a political matter that needs to be resolved politically… everyone should be accommodated.” But Thapa, who was earlier with Koirala and jointly led the ‘Koirala-Thapa camp’, lambasted the factional gathering organised by Koirala in Biratnagar. Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa formed a panel and contested for the posts of party president and general secretary, respectively, in the last general convention. While Deuba defeated Koirala, Thapa got elected as a general secretary.Now, Deuba is out of the race as the party statute puts a two-term limit on party chief, while both Koirala and Thapa are aspirants for the top position. Of late, Thapa has been inching closer to Deuba while Koirala has been hardening his position against Deuba and his Saturday’s posture could be part of the same strategy, observers said.The 14th general convention of the Nepali Congress was held in December 2021. The party charter gives each elected body a tenure of four years. But if the general convention cannot be held within four years, the charter provides for a year’s extension.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has yet again postponed the general convention of its student wing All Nepal National Independent Students’ Union (Revolutionary).An office-bearers’ meeting of the party on Thursday decided to defer the 23rd general convention, which was slated to commence in the Capital on Sunday. After several postponements, the national jamboree of the union started in September. However, it was suspended without electing the leadership following a dispute over the selection of convention representatives and whether or not set up an age bar for the leadership.With no sign for the resumption of the convention, a team of party’s student leaders, led by vice-chair Keshab Rawal, staged a hunger strike demanding the national gathering be held in December second week and leadership elected through a vote. They withdrew their strike with the party leadership agreeing to hold the convention starting on December 8. However, the party meeting led by chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal decided to defer the convention citing lack of preparations due to the need for the party to focus on local by-polls.The next Standing Committee meeting called for December 12 will take a decision regarding its student wing’s convention, according to party leaders.The student leaders, however, seem unconvinced. Rawal, who also is a contender for the union’s presidency, accused the party leadership of treating students as their slaves, who must obey them without question.“This is not just interference in student affairs, it shows they see us as slaves,” Rawal told the Post. “This is unacceptable. I don’t believe the party’s next meeting will announce the date. I will stage a protest again.” Though the party has cited lack of preparation for the postponement, insiders suggest that Dahal is worried because his chosen candidate may not win the elections. “The second rung leaders do not agree with Dahal’s selection. Dahal is avoiding election because he fears his candidate might lose,” said a party leader. Around a dozen student leaders backed by different factions within the party are in the race for the union’s presidency. Party’s senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha supports Pawan Karki. Karki had been running a parallel organisation within the union after Dahal picked Pancha Singh as chair two years back. Barshaman Pun is pushing for Dipesh Pun or Tukman Mahara and Janardan Sharma wants Madan Bhul or Narayan Khanal. Both the leaders are deputy general secretaries in the Maoist Centre.Naresh Regmi has the backing of Pampha Bhusal and Dev Gurung, the party’s vice-chair and general secretary, respectively. Although Dahal hasn’t openly endorsed any candidate, he reportedly has a soft corner for Regmi. By supporting Regmi ahead, Dahal wants to please Bhusal and Gurung to garner their support to induct Netra Bikram Chand, who had earlier splintered from the Maoist Centre, in the party. But deputy general secretaries Pun and Sharma reportedly do not want Chand in the party.The deputy general secretaries, though they are rivals, have started coming together when it comes to challenging Dahal’s leadership. “They feel that Dahal is imposing his decision by dividing them. It is clear that Pun and Sharma will not accept Dahal’s candidate for the union’s chairperson. They might even field a common candidate to counter Dahal’s candidate if voting takes place,” said the leader. “Defeat of Dahal’s candidate would mean he is losing grip on the party organisation.”Some of the student leaders, however, believe the December 12 meeting would take a decision regarding the convention. “I believe the party will either decide to hold voting or will handpick the leadership,” said Regmi.For years, the Maoist Centre’s leadership has directly selected the leadership of its student union. As many as 2,323 representatives were handpicked for the national gathering in September.However, a section of the leaders raised questions over the legality of around 70 representatives, most of whom are enrolled to various institutions under the Council for Vocational Education and Training. The dissident group argues that these representatives were handpicked without following the proper selection process.The differences escalated to the extent where representatives smashed the furniture at the Kirtipur venue of the convention twice as they clashed. A group of student leaders, taking cue from Mahara, the son of Jokh Bahadur Mahara, former Lumbini chief minister, even brandished a khukuri (Gurkha knife). A large number of police personnel were deployed at the Tribhuvan University campus to contain the protest.Right from the commencement of the conference, there were strong calls to impose an age limit for student leaders. But not everyone agreed to that. Without consensus, the issue was to be decided through voting. However, the voting didn’t take place due to the lack of agreement over the representatives leading to the convention’s postponement. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nNabil Bank Limited has introduced an ‘appointment banking system’ aimed at busy professionals, business owners, and customers who value their time and seek efficient service.This service is now available at the bank’s Head Office, Teendhara, Kathmandu.According to the bank, the appointment banking system enables customers to schedule a visit for essential banking services such as cash and cheque transactions, ensuring a faster and hassle-free experience. “This initiative is part of Nabil Bank’s continuous efforts to embrace digital banking and leverage the power of digitisation for prompt service and enhancing customer experience,” said Krishna Prasad Subedi, chief marketing officer of the bank.The system's key features include ensuring faster and hassle-free service for time-sensitive customers and making convenient bookings under which appointments can be scheduled quickly through the Nabil Bank website or the NBank App.The dedicated service minimises waiting time with professional assistance for cash and cheque transactions.“At Nabil Bank, we are committed to delivering innovative solutions that prioritise our customers’ needs. This reflects our dedication to providing efficient, personalised, and time-saving services, especially for professionals and businesses managing packed schedules,” said Subedi. \nNepal appears desperate to build a multi-million dollar cross-border liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline project and has started serious homework for the same.However, there is a paradox in the policy.Nepal is also preparing a 12-year plan to boost energy production and expand the market. The target is to produce over 28,000MW of electricity by 2035.Electric stoves are considered safer than LPG stoves as they do not have an open flame or combustible fuel source. The clear winner, however, will be LPG, as, according to experts, politicians have been lobbying for the gas pipeline without proper homework on the future of hydro and its investment.Nepal's petroleum import bill stood at Rs337.34 billion in the last fiscal, of which Rs55.61 billion was spent on cooking gas.Last week, Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari visited New Delhi, India, where a discussion was held on building a cross-border gas pipeline with Hardeep S Puri, India’s Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas.The ministers agreed ‘in principle’ to move forward with the project.Nepal has already chosen a site in Sarlahi, and the pipeline will come there from Motihari, India. “Once the project’s estimated cost is finalised, the two governments will decide on the funding modality,” said Baburam Adhikari, joint secretary of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. Nepal had requested the Indian government to build the LPG pipeline on grant. However, insiders say, as in the case of petroleum supply, Nepal should sign a long-term LPG supply agreement with India to make the project viable.If the government pushes for the LPG pipeline, what will be the future of hydropower, and what will happen to the government plan to use hydroelectricity in households?“That’s is not a good idea,” said Ganesh Karki, president of the Independent Power Producers’ Association, Nepal. The government should instead focus on increasing the country's power production and its domestic consumption, he said.Experts say reducing LPG imports by around Rs50 billion will help narrow the ballooning trade deficit.“We should not be dependent on LPG from India. We need to reduce its imports by prioritising electricity consumption,” said Karki.“Such LPG pipeline projects will take Nepal nowhere. We are spending billions to import LPG, which will obviously impact Nepal’s hydropower development,” said Karki. “If we promote fossil fuels and LPG imports, why would investors inject funds into hydro development?”The industry ministry and Nepal Oil Corporation officials say India is positive about supporting the construction of the Motihari-Sarlahi LPG project.Nepal buys all of its cooking gas from India, supplied by gas bullets.Nepal has been approaching India for the LPG pipeline construction since 2015 when the southern neighbour imposed a trade blockade.The India blockade, which began on September 23, 2015, and lasted about six months, was an economic and humanitarian crisis that severely affected Nepal and its economy.The cross-border LPG and oil pipelines were envisaged when Nepal suffered from an acute power shortage.In January 2015, the then Commerce Minister Sunil Bahadur Thapa and then Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan of India agreed to send an Indian technical team to Nepal to study the feasibility of setting up LPG and natural gas pipeline infrastructure from India to Nepal.Construction on the project began in April 2018 and was completed in April 2020.Now, with a hydro energy surplus, Nepal no longer needs an LPG pipeline, warn hydro investors.Observers say the LPG pipeline project could make Nepal more dependent on fossil fuels. In the coming years, the country will have abundant renewable energy to power the transport sector as well as energy-efficient electric stoves in its kitchens.An energy expert working on a government project, who wished not to be named, told the Post in August that building an LPG pipeline is another blunder. “Nepal will soon see a considerable amount of electricity generation that could substitute cooking gas and reduce trade deficit.”Environmentalists, too, have been saying that Nepal’s private sector is aggressively investing in hydropower, and the government’s investment in petroleum infrastructure could be a setback for them and the country.The government also has a goal of installing 500,000 improved cooking stoves, primarily in rural areas, and an additional 200,000 household biogas plants and 500 large-scale biogas plants.Nepal’s strategy is to have electric stoves as the primary cooking method in 25 percent of households by 2030.To meet this target, Nepal would need to invest $25 billion, according to estimates.According to Nepal’s National Statistics Office, among the 6.66 million households in the country, 51 percent use firewood and 44.3 percent use LPG in their kitchens.Among other types of cooking fuels, 0.5 percent of the families use electricity, 2.9 percent use dung cakes, 1.2 percent use biogas and 0.1 percent use kerosene or other fuels.Bagmati province, which contains Kathmandu Valley and has 1.56 million households, leads in LPG consumption, with 69.8 percent of the families using it for cooking.Besides the proposed LPG pipeline, in August, Nepal and India agreed on projects for an oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa, a greenfield tank terminal in Charali, and on an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan. \nThe Rs7.34 billion Siddhababa tunnel project is all set for a breakthrough.According to project officials, the 1.12-kilometre tunnel project on the landslide- and rockslide-prone Butwal-Palpa section of the Siddhartha Highway is set to achieve its final breakthrough in the first week of January. Two of the three bypass cross passages have been completed along this busy highway, which connects the hill districts of Lumbini and Gandaki provinces to Butwal and several Tarai districts.According to the project, the first bypass, spanning 151 metres, and the third bypass, measuring 130 metres, have been completed, and 165 metres of the major tunnel work remains to be completed.The project office said that 961 meters of digging on the north and south ends of the main tunnel were completed by Wednesday. Work on the main tunnel is being carried out simultaneously from both ends.“Workers are busy in the main tunnel,” said Krishna Raj Adhikari, the project's chief. The first bypass links the upper Siddhababa temple, and the third bypass connects to the Dobhan dam side. The section, notorious for its dangers, has claimed many lives, prompting the government to construct the tunnel. Over the last decade, at least 421 travellers have lost their lives, and many others have sustained injuries in numerous accidents on the treacherous 4-km road section, according to the District Traffic Office, Palpa.More than 10,000 vehicles ply the road section every day.The China State Construction Engineering Corporation signed the contract in March 2022 with a completion deadline of five years.The project is being constructed under the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) model, where a single contractor is responsible for all components, such as design, engineering, construction, and procurement.The contract binds the contractor to deliver the project within the stipulated timeframe and at the predetermined price, regardless of any possible cost overruns.According to the project office, the tunnel's physical progress has reached 33.59 percent, and its financial progress is at 32.2 percent. “As we are actively working for the main tunnel breakthrough within a month, we have ramped up manpower and resources,” said Adhikari.He said the project has sufficient blasting material in stock, and the construction company has deployed around 150 workers at the construction site to keep the project on track.The tunnel design has progressed as planned. “We have also strictly followed safety measures while widening the road,” said Adhikari. “The work inside the tunnel is progressing rapidly, but work on the outside has yet to start as efforts are underway to control landslides outside the tunnel.”“Rock shed and road designing works are also moving ahead smoothly,” said Adhikari. A rock shed is a protective structure built over a road or tunnel to shield it from falling rocks and debris. This protective covering redirects the falling material safely away, reducing the risk of accidents in landslide-prone areas.To stabilise the hillside around the tunnel in the Siddhababa area, a rock shed has been constructed over 1495 square metres, and work is underway to protect an additional 495 square metres on the northern side. The China State Construction Engineering Corporation was awarded the tender worth Rs7.34 billion. Besides a rock shed, the contractor will also construct rock fall netting and slope protection structures on the outer side of the tunnel.As per the detailed project report prepared with assistance from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the 1.12-kilometre tunnel will have double lanes with a width of 8.5 metres along with sidewalks. Around 900 meters of the double-lane road will link to the Chidiya River on the Butwal side and 560 meters will connect to the Palpa side.The Siddhababa-Dovan road section is the main link between more than a dozen districts in the plains and hills such as Palpa, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, Syangja, Kaski, Parbat, and Baglung.The tunnel is expected to provide safer and easier travel along the highway between the distrticts of Lumbini and Gandaki provinces. \nBarahi Kathmandu hosted an exclusive Christmas cake-mixing event on Thursday in its elegant private lounge, offering stunning panoramic city views.The event saw the presence of several high-profile guests, including celebrities, socialites, high corporate profiles and travel influencers who came together to celebrate the joy of the season, the hotel said in a press statement. Guests participated in the lively activity of blending a rich assortment of dried fruits, nuts, and aromatic spices to create the base for Barahi’s signature Christmas cakes. The private lounge’s luxurious ambience and breathtaking views of Kathmandu’s skyline set the perfect stage for this festive celebration. Roshan Sapkota, general manager of Barahi Kathmandu, expressed his delight at the successful event: “We are honoured to have hosted such an esteemed gathering for our Christmas Cake Mixing Event. This tradition is about more than just creating delicious treats; it’s about fostering connections and spreading festive cheer.With our distinguished guests’ support and our city’s unmatched views, this year’s celebration has been truly extraordinary.” \nThe Health Foundation Nepal (HFN), a non-profit established in 2013 by Nepali doctors in the United States, hosted its 12th annual conference on December 7 in Greensboro, North Carolina.Committed to improving healthcare for underserved communities in Nepal, HFN has been instrumental in addressing disparities in community and mental health and combating non-communicable diseases through its programmes in the Dang and Chitwan districts.One of its notable initiatives, Khushi Ba Ama, provides comprehensive support to senior citizens over 60, addressing both their healthcare and social needs.During the Annual Scientific Meeting, Dr. Shreedhar Paudel, HFN’s chairperson, underscored the organisation's achievements and outlined plans to expand collaborations with the Nepali government and other stakeholders to enhance healthcare initiatives.The conference also featured discussions on global and mental health advancements, with presentations covering topics such as cultural competence in mental health care and the prevalence of depression among Nepali medical students, reflecting HFN’s decade-long impact. \nNepal has banned additional three hazardous pesticides—paraquat dichloride, chlorpyrifos and phorate—which are not only being used to kill pests but are also being misused for suicide.“The Pesticide Management Committee has decided to prohibit the production, synthesis, export, import, transport, commercial use, storage, and sale of the said pesticides in the country,” reads the order published in the Nepal Gazette on Thursday.Poison ingestion, mostly involving pesticides, is the second leading cause of suicide in Nepal after hanging. According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 952 people killed themselves by consuming poison in the fiscal year 2023-24. “Poison is easily available in every household in rural areas across the country, as farmers often keep it in the house to use in crops,” said Dr Dilli Ram Sharma, former director general at the Department of Agriculture. “These hazardous substances are easily available in agri-veterinary shops and are not only being used in plants but also for suicide in our country.”Earlier, in 2018, the country banned eight pesticides—carbofuran, dichlorvos, triazophos, carbaryl, benomyl, carbosulfan, dicofol, and aluminum phosphide. Following the ban, suicides by poison ingestion have dramatically declined, according to Nepal Police report.Police data show that 1,320 people died by poison ingestion in 2018-19, the year authorities banned eight pesticides commonly used for suicide. The numbers dropped to 1,136 in 2019-20; 1,276 in 2020-21; 1040 in 2021-22 and 932 in 2022-23. Sharma said that traders can sell their existing stock of banned poisonous substances for up to two years, but cannot import more.“These pesticides are so hazardous that they can cause cancer, paralysis, renal failure, heart diseases in children, and deformities in newborn babies if used for a long time,” said Sharma. “Many countries, including India, have banned these pesticides.”After the ban on aluminium phosphide in 2018, people in crisis began ingesting chlorpyrifos, which is widely available on the market. Studies show that banning highly hazardous pesticides is a cost-effective and affordable intervention to reduce suicide rates. Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates. The country witnessed an alarming rise in suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year. “Restricting access to commonly used hazardous pesticides will help reduce deaths from suicides,” said Dr Rakesh Ghimire, principal investigator of Nepal for the Center for Pesticide Suicide Prevention at the University of Edinburgh of the United Kingdom, which has been carrying out research on suicides by poison ingestion in Nepal. “Many people who are in a moment of crisis can change their minds if they do not have access to poisonous substances.”Studies show that a ban on a few highly hazardous pesticides in Bangladesh, South Korea, and Sri Lanka, among others, led to sharp reductions in overall suicide rates. Pesticides are commonly used to get rid of insects, fungi, weeds and diseases which damage plants and crops. Every year more than 1,300 metric tons of 135 types of pesticides, including insecticide, fungicide, herbicide and biopesticide, are brought into Nepal, according to the Plant Protection Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.Doctors say high levels of pesticides in fruits and vegetables cause nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dizziness and anxiety. Long-term consumption of fruits and vegetables with high levels of pesticides can lead to kidney failure, lung disease and mental health problems, and can even cause cancer. According to health experts, the consumption of such fruits and vegetables may also affect pregnant women and harm the foetus. \nNearly 30 percent of doctors who completed their master’s degree and sat a recent licensing test of the Nepal Medical Council failed to score the pass mark.According to the council, the national regulatory body of medical doctors, only 175 out of 275 doctors who appeared for the exam passed the licensing test held on Thursday.“Only those who secure the pass mark become specialist doctors,” said Dr Chop Lal Bhusal, chairman of the council. “Those who fail the licensing test have to retake the exam.”The council conducts the licensing test for postgraduate doctors every four months. Those who fail can retake the exam until they pass.This is not the first time such a large number of doctors have failed to secure the minimum pass mark needed to practise as consultant doctors. Officials at the council said the average pass percentage for postgraduate doctors is around 70.“Only 50 to 55 percent of doctors with an MBBS degree pass the licensing test, while around 70 percent of postgraduate doctors pass,” said Bhusal. “What is worrying is a lot of doctors with master’s degrees are failing to secure even the pass marks.”To qualify as a medical practitioner, a doctor must secure at least 50 percent in the licensing exam. Experts say the quality of medical education is being compromised by underachievers who do not deserve to practise medicine entering the profession. “Universities and colleges must pay closer attention to the results of the doctors they produce,” said Bhusal. Licensing tests for medical doctors are a routine procedure in every country. Nepal’s licensing test focuses only on doctors’ knowledge. Some countries also conduct skill tests. Council officials said they had also planned to conduct skill tests in the past, but could not due to the lack of skill labs.“Only the National Academy of Medical Sciences;, Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine; and Kathmandu University’s Dhulikhel Hospital have skill labs,” said Dr Krishna Prasad Adhikari, former registrar of the Council. “We had planned to set up skill labs with support from various agencies, including the World Health Organisation, but things didn’t go as planned.”The World Health Organisation said inaccurate diagnosis, medical errors, inappropriate or unnecessary treatment, inadequate or unsafe clinical facilities and practices, and healthcare providers who lack adequate training and expertise are present in all countries. The UN health body says low-quality health care is increasing the burden of illness and health costs globally. \nThe Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, which has been running a human milk bank, is now providing breast milk to vulnerable infants born in other hospitals.Doctors at the hospital said the purpose of the milk bank is to save infants' lives, regardless of where they are born.“Human breast milk is required for vulnerable infants—those whose mothers died during or after giving birth, critically ill newborns in neonatal intensive care units, premature babies with low birth weights,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, director at the hospital. “We have been supplying breast milk to such infants in other hospitals, including Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Patan Hospital, Norvic Hospital, and B&B Hospital, among others.”The human milk bank, launched some two years ago at the hospital, aims to reduce neonatal deaths, which remains constantly high. Since 2016, neonatal deaths have not declined, despite various measures implemented by health authorities.According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births.Doctors say feeding low-weight babies and critically ill neonates in intensive care units can significantly reduce the risk of infections. The bank collects, tests, pasteurises and stores donor milk from lactating mothers.“The milk is collected mostly from the mothers of ailing babies, who cannot breastfeed their infants admitted to the intensive care units,” said Dr Sailendra Bir Karmacharya, a senior consultant paediatrician of the hospital. “We provide milk only to infants weighing less than 1,000 grams.”According to doctors, human breast milk contains the best source of nutrition and ensures the survival and healthy growth of babies. It bolsters brain development and has lifelong benefits for both the baby and the mother.Karmacharya said that human milk helps in reducing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal problem that mostly affects premature babies. Officials said the hospital needs 1.5 to 2.5 litres of breast milk for babies admitted to the intensive care unit. The human milk bank collects milk directly from mothers of hospitalised babies, but it collects only surplus milk from other lactating mothers, which is then tested, pasteurised and stored at minus 40 degrees Celsius. The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. The 16th five-year periodic plan, which ends in 2029, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from 21 per 1,000 live births. The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes, including hiring staff nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding has the potential to prevent 13 percent of under-five deaths. Studies show that Nepal's exclusive breastfeeding rate has steadily declined over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022, exclusive breastfeeding dropped consistently from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It stated that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), compared to 12 percent of those born at home.Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is prone to contamination and increases the risk of diseases in children, according to the World Health Organisation.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to breastfeed their babies, as studies show. The report shows that the proportion of children who are bottle-fed increases with mothers’ education, rising from 12 percent among children of mothers with no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Bottle-feeding is most common in the highest wealth quintile—46 percent—and least common in the lowest wealth quintile—11 percent.Among the seven provinces of Nepal, exclusive breastfeeding rates are the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest at 11 percent in Karnali Province, 12 percent in Madhesh Province and the highest at 43 percent in Bagmati Province.Doctors recommend breastfeeding for the first two years of a baby’s life or longer, as breast milk lowers the risk of illness in children, promotes their recovery during illness, and provides important nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nEminent city doctors and health experts today gave a call for caution, mass awareness and improved government policies to minimise the use of microplastics that can cause several health hazards, including cancer.Tiny plastic particles that are less than 5 mm are called microplastics and are being attributed to severe respiratory diseases or even some types of cancer. According to Dr Monidipa Mondal, an eminent radiation oncologist, when microplastics enter the body through food or other sources, they first encounter the immune cells. “Being micro-mini in size, they can easily enter the immune cells after which a biochemical agent called cyclophane is released. The cyclophanes prepare chronic information inside the cells. “As we know if chronic information continues to get stored in the cells, it can lead to cancer. Apart from this, cancer is also related to free radicals. Therefore, it also creates oxidative stress in the cells and free radicals in the cells due to which cell multiplication occurs,” informed the doctor.As reiterated by Dr Mondal, recent studies have revealed an increased number of colorectal cancers among people. “It has been found in some studies that microplastics could be a possible driver of colorectal cancer. Another observation reveals a link between breast cancer and microplastic. We have also heard about BPA-free plastic. BPA or Bisphenol-A is an agent that can mimic estrogen. In some cancer cases, estrogen has been found. It can, therefore, be said that if it can mimic estrogen, it could also be a possible cause of breast cancer,” she added.According to research by India Clean Air Network (India CAN), degraded plastic from waste and wastewater discharge due to inefficient treatment processes are two of the major sources of microplastics in West Bengal entering the human body in various ways. The health experts recommended stronger and improved government policies to curb the menace of plastic. As pointed out by Professor Sadhan K Ghosh, mass awareness, particularly among young students is the need of the hour. “The first need is waste segregation. Second, the governance should be such that microplastics are not created for which legislation and its implementation must be done. Also, as plastic becomes brittle and enters our body while swimming or is even consumed by fish that we eat, littering sea beaches should be prohibited,” pointed out the professor.-In Association with ANN \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nAfter a day break, the Nepal Premier League (NPL) cricket resumes Tuesday, with a doubleheader in the first match of the day between Lumbini Lions and Chitwan Rhinos while the second game of the day will see Karnali Yaks take on Pokhara Avengers.In the first match of the day, Lumbini with a chance to break their losing streak pit against the Rhinos at 9 am. With four losses in all four games, Lumbini is at the bottom of the table. Rhinos with three wins in four-match stand third at the points table.Led by Nepal’s national team captain Rohit Paudel, Lumbini, regarded as a strong contender before the tournament with the defeats in all four of their initial matches is on the brink of elimination from the playoff race. While Chitwan Rhinos, initially viewed as one of the weakest teams have won three out of their four matches. A win against Lumbini would bolster Chitwan’s playoff chances, while a loss would officially knock Lumbini out of the tournament.Meanwhile, Karnali Yaks will play their first match without Indian star batter Shikhar Dhawan at 1 pm. Yaks having lost their first two matches, bounced back with victories in their next two and stand at the 4th on the table. Pokhara Avengers, on the other hand, winning one of the total three matches stand 5th on the points table. To keep their playoff hopes alive, Pokhara must secure a win against Karnali in this crucial encounter. \nJanakpur Bolts continued their unbeaten run in the Nepal Premier League T20 cricket tournament as they overcame Lumbini Lions by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Sunday.Defending a modest 136, Janakpur narrowly held off Lumbini’s pursuit, restricting them to 135-8, with Canadian allrounder Harsh Thaker emerging as the hero to deliver a sensational final over to deny Sundeep Jora the winning run in the morning.Thaker returned astonishing match figures of 5-23 in his magical four-over spell that also included the key wickets of skipper Rohit Paudel (35 off 38), Tom Moores (31 off 23), Bibek Yadav (0) and Saad Bin Zafar (0).The clash reached its climax with Lumbini needing just two runs off the final ball. Jora, who had brought Lumbini tantalisingly close hammering 13 runs off Kishore Mahato in the 19th over, should have overhauled the target or at least collected a run to push the match into the Super Over. Instead, the wicketkeeper-batter attempted an ambitious boundary (or six) and was caught in the deep by Kishore Mahato after Thaker top-edged him.Jora had earlier escaped a run-out on the penultimate ball and was offered a chance to give Lumbini their first victory due to a misfield by Sher Malla but fell heartbreakingly short.Earlier, Anil Sah and Aasif Sheikh added 48 runs for the opening wicket to give Janakpur a strong start after being invited to bat first.Sheikh fell to Zafar (2-11) in the 5.3 overs after scoring 16 runs off 10 balls.Sah then partnered with Lahiru Milantha to share a 47-run partnership for the second wicket to continue the momentum.However, Lumbini’s bowlers hit back hard as Janakpur lost six wickets for just 15 runs, thanks to Abhishesh Gautam’s triple strike and two crucial scalps from skipper Paudel.A late cameo from Shubh Kansakar (22 not out off 24) ensured Janakpur post 136-9.The outcome gave Janakpur a fourth victory on the trot and helped them reclaim the top spot with eight points.Meanwhile, Lumbini’s fourth consecutive loss leaves them rooted at the bottom of the eight-team table, still searching for their first win.Missed chance Sudurpaschim missed their chance to go level on points with Janakpur after Chitwan Rhinos inflicted them their first loss of the tournament, winning by 33 runs later in the afternoon.Chasing 165 for win, Sudupraschim crumbled under pressure and were bowled out for 131.Sudurpaschim started their innings aggressively, with Saif Zaib cracking three fours in a quickfire 18 off 11 balls.Sudurpaschim’s troubles began when Rijan Dhakal (2-33) dismissed Zaib in the last ball of the second over.Binod Bhandari and Brandon McMullen tried to stabilise the innings but Kushal Malla (2-18) dismantled their efforts, removing both batters in the fifth over to leave Sudurpaschim teetering at 45-3.Aarif Sheikh also departed cheaply for four, trapped lbw by Ranjit Kumar.Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton then inflicted critical damage, dismissing Dilpreet Dajwa (12) and Dipendra Singh Airee (1) to reduce Sudurpaschim to 73-6.Ishan Pandey’s spirited 35 runs off 28 balls pushed the chase past the 100-run mark but Amar Routela halted the progress with a double strike in the 16th over, dispatching Naresh Budayair (5) and Pandey.A late effort from Naren Saud (10 off 8) and Scott Kuggeleijn (16 off 10) provided some hope but Dhakal’s catch-and-bowl dismissal of Saud and Tanvir’s lbw to Kuggeleijn sealed the game for Chitwan.Earlier, a half-century from Hassan Eisakhil helped Chitwan, who opted to bat first, post 164-5 from their 20 overs.Eisakhil steadied the innings with a well-crafted 65 off 52 balls after the early loss of opener Santosh Karki (9).Bipin Rawan supported Eisakhil with 17 off 20 in their 50-run stand, and Malla later assisted him with 13 off 16.Kuggeleijn removed both Rawal, Eisakhil and Malla to halt the progress.But Ravi Bopara added late fireworks with a blistering 36 off 18 to propel Chitwan to a competitive total.The result places Chitwan third in the standings, tied on points with Sudurpaschim, who remain in second place despite their defeat. \nChitwan Rhinos handed Sudurpaschim Royals their first defeat in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) on Sunday, securing a 33-run victory in the second match of the day at Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.Batting first after winning the toss, Chitwan posted a competitive total of 164 runs for the loss of five wickets in their allotted 20 overs. Opener Hassan Eisakhil led the charge with an impressive 65 runs off 52 balls, smashing six fours and three sixes. Ravi Bopara contributed 36 runs off 18 balls, including two sixes and two fours.For Sudurpaschim, Scott Kuggeleijn took two wickets, while Dipendra Singh Airee, Brandon McMullen, and Saif Zaib each claimed one.In reply, Sudurpaschim were bowled out for 131 runs in 18.2 overs. Ishan Pandey top-scored with 35 runs off 28 balls, hitting four fours and a six, before being caught off Amar Routela’s bowling. Contributions from Saif Zaib (18), Brandon McMullen (13), and Dilpreet Bajwa (12) fell short as the batting lineup struggled against Chitwan’s disciplined bowling attack.Chitwan’s bowlers shared the spoils, with Kushal Malla, Jean Nicol Leask, Rijan Dhakal, and Amar Rautela taking two wickets each. Sohail Tanvir and Ranjit Kumar chipped in with a wicket apiece.,The win places Chitwan Rhinos in third position on the points table with six points from four matches, while Sudurpaschim Royals hold the second spot due to a superior net run rate. Janakpur Bolts remain unbeaten at the top with eight points.In the earlier match, Janakpur Bolts narrowly defeated Lumbini Lions by one run in a thrilling contest. \nIndia has appointed current revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra as the new Reserve Bank of India governor, a notification from the government’s cabinet appointments committee on Monday showed.Malhotra, who has previously also held the post of secretary in India’s financial services department, will take over from Shaktikanta Das whose six-year term concludes on Tuesday.The Indian Administrative Service Officer, who over the last three decades has worked across sectors including power, finance, taxation, information technology and mines, has been appointed for a three-year term.Das took over as central bank chief in 2018, after previous governor Urjit Patel resigned before the end of his term following a difficult relationship with the government.Das had helped stabilise relations with the government while also overseeing a period of recovery in India’s financial sector and most recently led an effort to prevent a build-up of risk, asking lenders to avoid all “forms of exuberance.”The central bank, under Das, has also been seen as more interventionist in financial markets, stamping out volatility in the exchange rate to decadal lows. \nIsrael will step up airstrikes on Syrian stores of advanced weaponry, Israeli officials said on Monday, and keep a ‘limited’ troop presence on the ground, hoping to head off any threat that could emerge in the fallout of president Bashar al-Assad’s overthrow.Israel has watched the upheaval in Syria with a mixture of hope and concern as it weighs the consequences of one of the most significant strategic shifts in the Middle East in years.While Assad's fall wiped out a bastion from which Israel’s arch-foe Iran had exercised influence in the region, the lightning advance of a disparate group of rebel forces with roots in the Islamist ideology of Al Qaeda poses risks.Defence Minister Israel Katz said the military would “destroy heavy strategic weapons throughout Syria, including surface-to-air missiles, air defence systems, surface-to-surface missiles, cruise missiles, long-range rockets, and coastal missiles.”A senior Israeli official said airstrikes would persist in the coming days, while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel had no interest in interfering in internal Syrian affairs and was concerned only with defending its citizens.“That’s why we attack strategic weapons systems like, for example, remaining chemical weapons or long-range missiles and rockets in order that they will not fall into the hands of extremists,” Saar told reporters in Jerusalem.Still reeling from the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ attack in October 2023, Israel is also looking to head off any future threat from its neighbour.Israeli forces had already cleared landmines and established new barriers on the frontier between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and a demilitarised strip bordering Syria in October.Early on Sunday, the military said it had sent ground forces into the demilitarised zone, a 400-sq-km (155-sq-mile) buffer created by a 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement and overseen by the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF).The military on Monday published photos of Israeli commandos in the Syrian Mount Hermon area.Saar said the troop presence was strictly limited. “It’s basically near our borders, sometimes a few hundred metres, sometimes one mile or two miles,” he said. “It is a very limited and temporary step we took for security reasons.” \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nThe recent ‘framework agreement for BRI cooperation’ could be the perfect impetus for Nepal and China to kickstart the stalled BRI projects. Notably, the deal has the backing of both of Nepal’s major political forces, which together constitute nearly two-third parliamentary majority. China’s strained relations with the Nepali Congress, the country’s biggest political party, has been a hurdle to closer bilateral ties. While Beijing sees the Congress doing the bidding of Washington and New Delhi, the Congress feels China, going beyond the bounds of diplomacy, wants to cultivate exclusive ties with Nepal’s communist parties. The framework agreement could help change such unhelpful mutual suspicions. It was signed with the consent of the Congress. Beijing will take note. Some may argue that there is still disgruntlement in the Congress over the agreement. But then, was the entire party on board even when the Congress leadership took the monumental decision to form a government under KP Sharma Oli’s leadership?The other day, I bumped into a senior leader from the ‘rival’ Congress camp. As we both sipped masala tea while soaking in the winter sun, I started picking his brain. “The Congress is divided over the new BRI agreement, isn't it?” I asked. “These are useless murmurs of discontent inside the party,” he replied without missing a beat. “As the party functions today, if daju-bhauju want something, they get it.”Just like the CPN-UML is a one-man Oli show these days, the Congress too is firmly under the control of the Deubas—Sher Bahadur and Arzu Rana. It was the couple who dragged the party willy-nilly into the government, and they also had the final say from the Congress on the BRI deal. “If it’s fait accompli, why are some Kanresis still making hue and cry about the deal?” I pressed the Congress leader.“I will tell you in one word: India.” The southern neighbour is not happy with Nepal’s participation in the BRI. The initiative, with the China Pakistan Economic Corridor as its centerpiece, is seen as inimical to Indian interests. Kathmandu’s participation in it also threatens to yank Nepal out of India’s orbit.A Nepal-based Indian diplomat chose to put it thus: “Look how the MCC deal progressed in Nepal. The relevant document was in public domain and the compact was vigorously debated in your parliament. Shouldn’t the same metric apply to the Belt and Road Initiative? You guys haven’t even seen any of the vital BRI documents!”As the Congress leader suggested, if there are no new irritants in Congress-UML relations, the disagreement within the Congress over the new BRI deal could soon blow over. It should. The Deubas may have backed the framework for their personal goals. More importantly, it is also in Nepal’s interest. If India’s repeated blockades have taught us something, it is not to rely too heavily on our southern neighbour. This, among other things, means reaching out to Beijing to build vital connectivity projects and develop new economic links. But Nepal cannot lean too far towards China as well: We are two different societies with vastly different political cultures. This is why we must strike a careful balance between the two neighbours—and with the new sky neighbour in the United States. But this again will be impossible if the Congress and the UML continue to wield Nepal’s foreign policy as a domestic political bludgeon. Traditionally, the Nepali communists have cottoned to China. On the other hand, the Nepali Congress has been a staunch backer of close ties with India. These party-wise leanings have done great harm to Nepal. For this reason, the need for a consensus based foreign policy has long been felt. The country’s two biggest parties often (and naturally) found themselves in opposite benches in parliament and fought tooth and nail on foreign policy, particularly over India and China. The debates around the American MCC compact were rather acrimonious too. Now, by sheer luck, the Congress and the UML are together in the government. This presents a rare opportunity to build broad consensus on foreign policy. Oli has gone to China and stitched together an important deal. Perhaps he can do the same with India and with Nepal’s other important international friends—again with the support of the Congress. In this way, this ‘coalition of convenience’ for Oli and Deuba could herald an era of a more coordinated foreign policy approach. The new China deal has already given an encouraging message that Nepali political parties are capable of acting together on vital foreign policy issues.Some may reckon many aspects of the BRI are still vague and as such Nepal should be cautious. True. Yet the current agreement also gives Nepal enough wiggle room to back out of unwanted proposals from Beijing. The ‘aid financing modalities’ can include both soft loans and grants. Based on the deal, it would be impossible for Beijing to insist that Nepal accept high-interest Chinese loans. This possibility will be further mitigated if negotiations take place on a case-by-case basis. Principally, Nepal cannot refuse any and all kinds of loans from China—as some in the Congress argue it should—while it eagerly laps up such loans from the rest of the world. In any case, under three percent of the foreign loans Nepal has taken comes from China—less than what Japan or India have lent it. By contrast, the World Bank and the ADB contribute over 80 percent of Nepal’s loans. As the BRI is the centrepiece of China’s foreign engagement under President Xi Jinping, Nepal cannot reject the initiative and still maintain healthy relations with Beijing. If we can agree on the right projects, there is no harm in taking some soft loans under the BRI. Again, going beyond the BRI, the Congress and the UML should take the lead in preparing a common white paper on foreign policy—while they are still a part of the ruling coalition. History suggests this will be difficult to do when the parties are in opposition camps.  \nBritish philosopher Bertrand Russell in his famous essay about the idea of a university says that a university is, first and foremost, a place. He stresses that a university—though it is a concept, an idea, a poetics of space and a metaphor of culture and life—is, in the final analysis, a place. We should be clear about that. This famous essay in the English textbook, The English We Use, was discussed with Bachelor level students at Tribhuvan University. It represents Russell's concept of space as a sanctuary of a university. The period when we taught this essay was marked by a certain shift in educational innovations and what the university claimed “a quest for a new educational system”. It happened sometime in the early 1970s. The experiment was called the New Education System Plan introduced by Tribhuvan University. The plan, among other things, tried to shuffle or deconstruct the concept of “university” as a place and introduce an idea that used new technologies in education to diffuse certain fixed notions about it and invent ways to make educational experiments. I want to cite from a keynote address that I delivered at the 34th Annual Conference of the Linguistic Society of Nepal on November 26, 2013. “When the New Education System Plan used computer for screening applications for admission in colleges the news spread like Australian bush fire. I remember one senior citizen who turned up at a working centre located in Padmakanya campus seeking admission of his daughter-in-law at the proficiency certificate level some time in 1972, asking … ‘Sir, I want to meet computer sir because they say he has taken the entire responsibility of admitting or rejecting students’ bharnaa’”. As a young teacher at the university, I was also assigned to work as a member of that team meeting on the campus. Professor Shiva Gopal Risal had tried to seek to sort out the senior man’s question respectfully. Did the computer come as a toy to confound people, create wonder and deprive them of educational opportunities, or promote true education? No responsible agency addressed that question.A straight answer is that Tribhuvan University, the sole higher educational institution in the country, was seeking to pluralise the concept of place as a university. It wanted to do so by challenging the concept of a fixed space and substituting in its place the idea of education as a concept that could be shared across the campuses. But that concept did bring problems with it. It came as a double whammy—educational spaces lost their unique identities and failed to use the new syllabuses and technologies that were few and far between. That varied according to the nature of the institutions. However, the idea of using new technologies to teach humanities and social sciences did not work. The following period saw the emergence of several universities and higher educational institutions. Spaces multiplied. Opportunities came to open plural centres and locations to impart higher education understood under different geographical and cultural rubrics. One can easily guess that the period had brought some euphoric moments. People who took up the cudgel to start new institutional centres under this euphoria were doing admirable work. But things do not appear to have worked to fulfil the good dreams of the good people. Tribhuvan University continued to grow larger and attract more students. I am dismayed by the smaller number of students at other higher educational institutions or universities in Nepal. Sudip Kaini of Kantipur presents some important figures in his survey of students’ enrollment. The students enrolling for university education appear to go mostly to TU (more than 77 percent). Of the 16 universities, hardly one percent get admitted to 10 universities. According to one University Grants Commission report, out of more than 0.6 million students, almost 0.5 million go to TU. In terms of percentage, the rate of admission in Pokhara University is 5.56, Kathmandu University is 3.33, Far Western University is 3.06, Mid Western University is 1.61, University of Forest and Agriculture is 0.64, Nepal Sanskrit University is 0.52 and Lumbini Baudha University is 0.29. All these universities were established over a decade ago. The figures speak volumes. The onus of higher education lies on the largest and the oldest TU.Reports about the land grabbing of Tribhuvan University's central location are emerging. Reportedly, out of the 3,613 ropanis of the University's land, 900 ropanis are occupied by 19 outer organisations. (Naya Patrika, June 29, 2022). That is a stunning report. The figures and reports are easily available now. Other universities in the country have their own narratives about their lands. The land story shows the centrality of the TU in terms of its size, location and spread. It has become more crucial to address the question of land because of the needs of universities other than TU. Universities tell their stories about acquiring spaces, with the theme of politics and power, which have become an essential subject of discussion today. For instance, Kathmandu University acquired spaces inside Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur metropolis and outside to open its various institutions and departments; it is unique in many ways.We return to the mega story of TU trying to track its land, which people and institutions grabbed over a long period. Evoking Russell's idea of a university as a place, we can say that TU, far from finding its spaces and cogently using them to create sanctuaries, is fighting on two fronts—restoring ownership of its land and using that for academic purposes by making the institution stronger and more important. To take an eloquent example, the euphoric activities of good sports and the noise and crowd generated by it indicate the centrality and importance of TU's space in Kirtipur. It is natural for a university that gives higher education to the 77 percent of the students of this land, irrespective of the fact that there are other functioning universities, to find its space, its land, and to seek to function with dignity and a system. The whole thing is related to the question of space, prestige and the creation of a permanent operation system. I believe now is the right time to work on all these fronts. I want to repeat a popular Nepali expression—sabailai chetana bhaya.  \nIt is no secret that Nepal is teetering on the scale of economic fragility. Even though the government has introduced some progressive policies and economic benchmarks, the country still struggles to stabilise its economy. This is partly due to an excessive reliance on remittances and policies favouring their growth. Remittances may appear beneficial but can lead to instability in various other sectors. Such a phenomenon is known as the Dutch disease effect. In the 1960s, the Dutch economy grew as they discovered large swathes of oil deposits in the Northern Sea. An oil boom of this calibre can speed up the economic growth of any nation. However, such shallow development led to inflation, eventually sickening their economy. Subsequently, non-petroleum commodities became less competitive and more expensive. In other words, overly depending on a single export source led to the erosion of the value of other commodities. Nepal isn’t known for having oil reserves and deposits like that of the Netherlands. However, several experts and policymakers have highlighted that the burgeoning inflow of remittances can cause a series of Dutch disease-like impacts akin to that of commodity booms. Since the disease affects any economy that is heavily reliant on foreign currency, foreign assistance and foreign direct investments, Nepal, in particular, becomes vulnerable. As the gap in the remittance-to-nation ratio continues to widen, the national currency value is likely to diminish. The latest report from Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) states that Nepal’s remittance for the fiscal year 2023-24 totalled Rs1,445.32 billion, a 15 percent increase compared to the previous fiscal year. In contrast, the data on remittance in 2016 was Rs679 billion, which is less than half the remittance as of this year. Such a level of dependency can exacerbate inflation, drive up consumption prices and intensify the real estate bubbles. When the value of properties becomes far more than its worth, it creates a mass trickle-down effect that continues to pour over other productive sectors. The symptoms of Dutch disease continue to strain the Nepali economy for two main reasons. First, there is a significant exodus of labour migrants. Many Nepalis flock to foreign countries, either temporarily or permanently. This is encouraged by the government as well as political leaders. Second, Nepali consumers often have a preference for imported commodities. As the country becomes less independent, it relies far more than necessary on imports. Several macroeconomic reports indicate a negative trade-off for Nepal in its exports of labour migrants and skilled manpower, with many opting to reside abroad in search of a better life. No amount of Riyals, Ringgits, or Dirhams can compensate for the loss of a long-term sustainable development. Production doesn’t become feasible for the general populace, leading to overreliance on imports. In a nation where the balance of payments is consistently stretching towards the negative bottom, the lack of adequate labour force participation has become a hindrance in productive sectors. NRB’s empirical analysis suggests that further reliance on remittance at an increasing level can widen the trade deficits, both in the short and the long run. As consumer demand increases, the supply side can barely keep up, creating inflationary pressures and increasing prices.Further, a nation that prides itself on its so-called vision of independence is now at the mercy of remittances. A shift in policies or geopolitical instability, rising tensions within the Gulf nations, and the spread of the Israel-Palestine conflict to other nations can dramatically affect the prospects of labour migrants sending their hard-earned money home. There is no denying that remittance has played a significant role in Nepal’s economy. It has contributed considerably to economic growth and increased foreign exchange reserves. However, the concerned authorities shouldn’t forget that excess reliance on one economic sector can lead to a perpetual decline in other sectors. Given the threat of excess dependency on remittance, Nepal must diversify its economic portfolio. Concomitantly, with the help of effective plans and policies, the exodus of foreign labour migrants must be mitigated. Opportunities should be created and provided in the home country. Financial institutions that draft impactful policies must adhere to congenial policies. The need for macroprudential policies, whose primary goal is to maintain financial stability and limit fiscal vulnerabilities, becomes more crucial to minimise the possibility of carrying the symptoms of the Dutch disease. Only by acting prudently can Nepal safeguard its economy. \nTo its credit, the team of KP Sharma Oli in Beijing somehow convinced the Chinese to sign the BRI framework agreement on Wednesday. The Chinese don’t do hasty negotiations. A day earlier, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had met his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang. On the same evening, there was a meeting between Oli and Chinese President Xi Jinping. A joint statement was issued later in the day, outlining all the major developments of Oli’s trip. The much-hyped framework for BRI cooperation had found no mention in the statement. China watchers back home started bemoaning the ‘abject failure’ of Oli’s China trip. But then Team Oli, which included his chief advisor Bishnu Rimal and chief economic advisor Yubaraj Khatiwada, pulled a rabbit out of the bag.The final terminology used to describe the money that will come into Nepal under the BRI rubric has some ambiguity, as ‘aid financing modalities’ can include both grants and loans. But then, such in-between terminologies are common in bilateral negotiations where each side is looking to keep certain constituencies back home happy. The important thing is that both the top leaders of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties in the country, agreed on the term. And when it was presented to the Chinese, so did they. The ‘aid financing modalities’ do not preclude all kinds of loans. In fact, the understanding seems to be that the term means that Nepal will consider low-interest loans such as it was getting from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. That is how it should be. How can Nepal accept loans from the rest of the world but shun it from China? The Congress leadership also seems to have realised the flaw in its earlier reasoning that no kind of loan from China was acceptable. The good thing is that the agreement with China is likely to last as it has the backing of the country’s two major parties, who together make nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority. It was the differences between these two on loans from China that helped them flesh out the outstanding issues over the BRI framework. This in turn added clarity to the issues. (Some differences on the BRI persist inside the Congress, but that is to be expected in a democratic party.) Perhaps the Chinese this time thought that even though they were being asked to hurry, the proposal on the table, which had the backing of Nepal’s two major political parties, was worth signing. There are still many unknowns about the BRI. But at least Nepal stood its ground when necessary, while also not being rigid. This signals a maturing of Nepali diplomacy. After the BRI framework agreement, we again hope that the Congress and the UML and other parties can come to similar understandings on Nepal’s relations with India and the US–and on Nepal’s other vital ties. Consensual foreign policy is the need of the hour. Right now, it is worth celebrating that China, which harboured deep suspicions of the Congress, will be more amenable to dealing with Nepal’s biggest party. Their mutual suspicions were poisoning Nepal-China relations. Perhaps the long-stuck train of the BRI in Nepal will now finally start chugging.  \nWith the by-elections to elect 44 local representatives in 32 districts done and dusted, reviews and analysis of the final results are pouring in thick and fast. Given the palpable discontent against the parties from across the political spectrum, predicting the bypolls results was not easy. Leaders from the CPN (Maoist Centre) have been in a celebratory mood since Tuesday after winning a couple of important seats after years of electoral setbacks. The former rebel outfit that emerged the clear first party in the 2008 general elections had been consistently losing votes and seats in subsequent polls.On the other hand, leaders from the CPN-UML don’t appear excited despite the party winning some important office bearer positions in different local units. The Nepali Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, lost some key positions in a few units as well. Unhappy with the results, the two largest parties have decided to review the outcomes through the respective party mechanisms.One noteworthy feature of the recent bypolls was that voters this time showed little faith in the new forces, unlike in the previous polls. Traditional fringe parties like the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party and the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist) that failed to get national party status in parliament in the last general elections picked up a seat each this time. But new forces such as the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Janamat Party didn’t do well. The RSP won only a ward chair in Kathmandu while the votes garnered by its candidates in other local units were negligible. The RSP, which emerged the fourth largest force in 2022 barely six months after its formation, had done better in the by-elections in April 2023. However, it couldn’t maintain the momentum when a by-election was held to elect a federal lawmaker from Ilam in April this year. The Janamat Party, another outfit that emerged from the last general election, failed to get even a single seat this time. Interestingly, the voters also discarded forces like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party that champions revival of the Hindu monarchy. The pro-monarchy party, the fifth largest in the federal legislature, didn’t win a single seat in Sunday by-polls.For long-term success, a political party needs to have clarity in its agenda and vision, a robust organisation, and strong bond with the general people. Elections are key yardsticks to gauge whether a political party has these strengths. There is broad consensus that the public is disenchanted with major political forces like the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre that have ruled this country by turns for the past two decades. People in previous elections gave a chance to new outfits as they were frustrated by the old forces’ failure to deliver. The level of support these new forces got was perhaps not an endorsement of their vision and agenda, which are sketchy. While these forces succeeded in fanning anger against the incumbents, they failed to offer anything better. Experts caution against drawing hasty conclusions based on the results of elections held for just 44 local level seats. Yet the by-polls were held across all seven provinces, and covered the capital city Kathmandu to remote villages, hills to plains, east to west. In sum, Nepalis are giving a clear message to the political forces old and new: do not take our support for granted.  \nIn under four months, tenth graders all over Nepal will appear in the School Education Examination (SEE). This is a time for students to focus on final preparations. Sadly, hard work alone won’t yield better results when the schools and curriculum fail to cater to their needs. Every year, when the results are out, many students have to endure crushing failure. However, as in previous years, the authorities have failed to learn from their mistakes. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is making baseless predictions of a 70 percent pass rate in the upcoming SEE. How will this be achieved in a country where pass rates have for years hovered below 50 percent?Among 464,785 students who appeared in the last SEE, only 222,472—47.87 percent—secured a Grade Point Average (GPA) above 1.60, which is necessary to study at a higher level. However, 242,313 students—52.13 percent—were categorised as non-graded. After the supplementary exams, over a third of them were graded, qualifying them to study in grade 11. Oli’s forecast is only plausible if the results improve by around 50 percent, which is unlikely. The grading system was introduced in 2016 to reform the examination system, focusing less on marks and more on interactive learning. But the hangover of the old School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exams persists. While the system has been upgraded, the teaching and learning are still the same. Schools are grappling with a shortage of teachers for major subjects like Science, Mathematics and English. Rural provinces like Karnali have suffered the most and some schools are hiring under-qualified teachers to fill the gaps. With teachers unable to address their problems, students have no choice but to rely on rote learning. To cope, the government is focusing on extra online classes. But such online classes for school students hold only symbolic value. In Nepal, fear has always been a tool for teaching and learning. Most schools do not foster an environment where students enjoy learning. This mentality also applies to how the education system views examinations like SEE. Students are put under pressure to perform well, as if it were a “do or die” situation. The shame of failure scars students for life. Some private schools take advantage of this fragile emotional state of students by enforcing mandatory tuition classes. Further, as schools in rural areas can’t complete the syllabus on time, it creates an opportunity for private tuition centres to generate profit as students migrate a few months before SEE to study in such centres. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres.Schedule 8 of the constitution gives local units the authority to manage school education. But the lack of a Federal Education Act, a must to implement constitutional provisions, is a big hurdle towards this laudable goal. Among its various flaws, the controversial Education Bill, registered in Parliament last year, fails to establish minimum criteria for establishing schools. The government must realise that the basics must be fulfilled before setting lofty goals. There must be mechanisms to recruit qualified teachers and retain them. It is also imperative to update the pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. The SEE marks the culmination of over a decade of schooling. Therefore, it is unfair to blame the students who have trusted the system for long. The poor SEE results are a direct reflection of the system’s failure. Whether we have the SEE or the SLC, the flawed education system will continue to jeopardise the future of hundreds of thousands of young students.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nToday the weather is forecast to be generally to mostly cloudy in Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and partly to generally cloudy in the rest of the country.Light to moderate rain is likely to occur at some places of Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and light rain at a few areas of hilly regions of the rest of the country.
