Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe parliamentary meeting on Thursday that was expected to end the ongoing impasse ended up in a scuffle between the ruling and opposition lawmakers.The House meeting called for 11 in the morning was postponed until 4 pm in an attempt to find a meeting point among the parties over the formation of a parliamentary panel to probe Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s embezzlement of cooperatives funds. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal himself had held meetings with ruling parties and also the main opposition Nepali Congress to find a way out. However, the ruling parties and the Congress couldn’t agree on terms of reference of the parliamentary probe committee.The ruling parties agreed to constitute the parliamentary panel to investigate the embezzlement of savings in the cooperatives and recommend action against the individuals, institutions and companies benefited illegally. However, the Congress wanted the probe focused on Rabi Lamichhane, erstwhile managing director at the Gorkha Media Network, and others who illegally benefited from Supreme, Suryadarshan, and Swarnalaxmi, among other cooperatives. The ruling parties, particularly Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), did not agree to the proposal to focus only on the cooperatives where Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane is allegedly involved. “Our demand is to constitute a parliamentary committee to investigate the problems facing the cooperative sector, including Rabi Lamichhane’s involvement in the alleged fraud. The ruling alliance is not ready for it. It wants a panel that will broadly investigate the problems in the sector without addressing our concerns. The alliance is trying to divert attention from the main issue,” said Prakash Sharan Mahat, the Nepali Congress spokesperson explaining why there could be no agreement.The ruling parties, however, say the Congress, guided by a mala fide intent, has been insisting on an investigation committee focusing on three or four cooperatives. “We had just demands: first, our chairperson must be allowed to clarify on the allegations in Parliament. Second, as problems have been seen in several cooperatives, there must be a broader investigation,” said Manish Jha, an RSP lawmaker. “Why just focus on three or four cooperatives? Why not probe the cooperatives that are led by Congress leaders?”The meeting of the House of Representatives postponed for 4 pm was held two hours later. No sooner had the meeting commenced, the Congress started chanting slogans. Amid the obstruction, Speaker Devraj Ghimire read out the letters from the President’s Office regarding the authentication of a bill and addition of ministers from the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party. The situation got tense when Ghimire asked Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and address the meeting amid the protest of the main opposition.The Congress lawmakers had already gathered at the well and were raising slogans demanding a parliamentary probe into Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling funds of several credit cooperatives.After the Speaker allowed the minister to go to the rostrum, the Congress lawmakers and senior CPN-UML leaders, who were on the front row of the ruling bench, engaged in heated verbal exchanges. The situation escalated after UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress vice president Dhanraj Gurung engaged in an intense argument. Other lawmakers from the two sides subsequently joined the resulting scuffle. Even Prime Minister Dahal and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Rekha Sharma engaged in an argument with the Congress lawmakers.Both sides have pointed fingers at each other for the tensions. “The situation escalated after the Congress lawmakers tried to stand in front of the rows designated for the ruling parties in order to prevent Home Minister Lamichhane from heading to the rostrum,” said Sharma. “The Congress is responsible for the unparliamentary behaviour.” The UML has demanded an apology from the Congress, claiming its lawmakers misbehaved with Oli.The Congress, however, said the Speaker’s irresponsible move [of inviting the home minister to the rostrum] was responsible for the unpleasant incident in the House. “The Speaker is guided by partisan interests. It was wrong of him to invite the home minister to address the House when the opposition was obstructing the House,” said Mahat. The next House meeting has been called for 11 am Friday.Earlier, the meeting of the National Assembly was also adjourned until 1:15 pm on Friday following obstruction from the Nepali Congress.The main opposition has been obstructing the budget session of Parliament since the first day of the session that commenced on May 10. However, the opposition parties had allowed the President to table the government’s policies and programmes. The RSP has said they will not agree to any probe panel targeting its chairperson. “The probe panel will be formed only if there is an agreement to investigate the Congress President [Sher Bahadur Deuba] and his son,” said Jha. “To challenge our party, those who have been in power for decades need to come clean.” \nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has questioned the constitutional role and the impartiality of Speaker Devraj Ghimire following a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives.After Thursday’s incident, relations between the ruling CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the main opposition, Nepali Congress, could get more sour.“The Speaker should take the main responsibility for today’s incident,” Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said during a news conference after the scuffle between the opposition and ruling lawmakers. “The Speaker was following a leader’s order.” Thapa hinted that the Speaker was guided by the ruling CPN-UML. Ghimire was elected to the House from Jhapa on a UML ticket. Though a lawmaker formally disassociates him/herself from the party, their independence in running the House is often questioned.“Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened today in the House is unfortunate and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.”He also hinted that UML chairman KP Sharma Oli had instigated Thursday’s tensions. While speaking at a function on Wednesday, Oli had stated that Thursday’s Parliament meeting would proceed despite obstruction by the Nepali Congress. “Today we saw that happen,” said Thapa. “This means the Speaker was taking orders from the leader [Oli].”Thapa claimed that when his party’s vice-president, Dhanraj Gurung, was chanting slogans demanding a parliamentary probe, Oli approached and provoked him. Then the scuffle ensued, said Thapa.Thapa also declared that the Congress will not sit for talks with anyone until a parliamentary committee is formed. Some Congress leaders were earlier in talks with their Rastriya Swatantra Party counterparts and had exchanged terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary committee, but there was no further development due to their differences. Leaders said that Thursday’s scuffle has added to the uncertainty of the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the cooperatives scam and Lamichhane’s alleged involvement.“We were about to agree on the terms of reference [ToR] of the proposed parliamentary committee with the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” said a Nepali Congress office bearer. “But there was a disagreement after the RSP refused to include the home minister’s name in the draft.”The ToR proposed by the Congress explicitly called for probing the role of the home minister in the cooperatives scam. But the RSP has been insisting on a probe into the entire cooperatives sector and not Lamichhane.   \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nFor decades, cross-border trade between Nepal and India was traditionally done due to social ties spanning borders. The situation now is different. It’s now an organised commercial informal trade happening at a large scale, according to a research finding. Rice appears to be a key commodity ‘highly informally’ imported from India to Nepal. The research, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, shows that only 40 percent of rice is imported to Nepal from India through a formal channel.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, leading to a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports. In the current fiscal year, the government also introduced a 13 percent VAT on some vegetables, including onions and potatoes.With this variation, the price differences between Nepal and India become 18-20 percent, or rice in India becomes cheaper by at least 18 percent.The paper said that India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west. According to a separate report by the International Food Policy Research Institute, carrying or informally transferring goods has become a full-time profession for many poor families living close to the towns along the Nepal-India border.“Carriers,” many of them women, collect the goods on the Indian side and bring them in via the open border, escaping the formal customs entry points, sometimes on foot, sometimes on bicycles and motorbikes, and always at their own risk.Presenting the report titled ‘Insights into Informal Cross-Border Trade in Agri-Food Commodities in South Asia’, Dikshya Singh, programme coordinator at SAWTEE, a South Asian think tank based in Kathmandu, said the export duty imposed by India on rice in September 2022 followed by an export ban on non-basmati rice in July 2023, fueled the informal trade.The report said that rice, vegetables, chemical fertilisers, and seeds are other agricultural products and inputs that have been largely coming through informal channels.The study reveals that this informal trade is dominated by a small group of traders forming an oligopoly. Moreover, the study indicates that large-scale informal trade is controlled by mafia-style syndicates with political backing.Anand Bagaria, managing director of Nimbus Holdings, said Nepal needs proactive measures to deal with informal cross-border trade. “Since we cannot influence our neighbouring countries’ policies, Nepal needs to be clear about what could be the right balance between inflation, government revenue, and mitigating quality-related risks while dealing with informal trade.”Singh said Nepal heavily relies on informal trade to meet its need for agricultural inputs.The report attributes the illegal import of chemical fertiliser to the persistent shortage in Nepal and cheaper rates in India.The report showed that Nepal needs 800,000 tonnes of chemical fertiliser annually. The country has been able to import 400,000 tonnes formally, and an estimated 200,000 tonnes come through informal channels. According to the report, farmers in Nepal have been informally importing a variety of seeds that are not available locally, especially hybrid seeds of vegetables, mainly due to import restrictions and to avoid non-tariff requirements.SAWTEE conducted surveys at nine customs points, including Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Biratnagar, Nepalgunj, Kakarbhitta, Krishnanagar, Jaleshwar, Suthauli, Maheshpur, and Bhadrapur and the border crossings in their periphery.“The informal trade between Nepal and India is as big as formal trade,” said Paras Kharel, executive director of SAWTEE. Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary, said that gold and silver, areca (palm) nuts, onion and garlic, poppy seed, edible oil, and black pepper are informally exported to India from Nepal. “Informal trade is rising between Nepal and India because of the price differences caused mainly due tariff advantage and tariff differences and non-tariff barriers for formal export.”“The misdeclaration of exported goods from Nepal to India needs to be addressed,” he said. For instance, Nepal exports cabbage to India from Koshi province. As India has restricted the import of other types of vegetables from Nepal, traders are exporting other vegetables like okra, chayote, and chilli under the name of cabbage, Ojha said.Article 2 of the trade treaty between Nepal and India, and the agreement on cooperation to control unauthorised trade talks about controlling informal trade. “During the bilateral discussion, be it commerce level, inter-government committee meetings, or customs director-level meetings, either annually or bi-annually, they discuss informal trade. But there hasn’t been any serious discussion about controlling informal trade,” Ojha said.Nepal raised issues like the informal import of agricultural goods from India to Nepal, while the Indian side brought up issues like the informal import of goods including areca nuts, edible oil, poppy seeds, and black pepper, but no concrete solution has been found yet, according to Ojha. Sabnam Shivakoti, joint secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, pointed out that cross-border trade that was done traditionally due to social ties across borders is not the same as the organised commercial informal trade that is happening now on a large scale. “This has been affecting agricultural and industrial sectors as they have to compete with cheap imports.”According to Shivakoti, an import restriction on dairy products was announced in February 2024 to protect domestic farmers and the dairy industry, but that led to formal imports being diverted to informal channels.Trade experts said that as the Indian government is providing eight types of subsidies on agricultural products, as a result, Nepali products become less competitive even in the domestic market, raising the informal trade to Nepal. \nDefending champions Armed Police Force Club wrapped up their group stage with a perfect record as they defeated Sudurpaschim Province by three wickets in the Lalitpur Mayor Women’s T20 Championship at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Thursday.APF had already secured their spot in the final on Wednesday after registering their third consecutive victory in as many matches.Thursday’s victory also ensured APF top spot in the five-team standing.APF will now look to win a record extending fourth title in the title match on Saturday.Electing to field first after winning the toss, APF restricted Sudurpaschim to 111-5 in the allotted 20 overs.Sudurpaschim captain Bindu Rawal top scored for the team with 36 runs off 51 balls. Bindu and opener Rubi Poddar put on a 57-run stand for the second wicket.After Poddar returned to the pavilion making 29 runs off 36 balls, Bindu added 37 runs with Kabita Joshi, who played 29 not out off 28 balls, to guide Sudurpaschim to a fighting total.Manisha Bohara, Samjhana Khadka, Ritu Kanoujiya could not score in double digits.Rekha Rawal and national team captain Indu Barma took one wicket each for APF.In reply, APF made a shaky start to their chase, losing Rajmati Airee (11), Barma (4) and Sita Rana Magar (5) cheaply.Roma Thapa departed next scoring 23 runs off 20 balls, leaving APF in deep trouble at 50-4 in the eighth over.But Mamta Chaudhary played an unbeaten 32-ball knock and Sarita Magar added 19 runs off 30 balls to lead the departmental side to 112-7 in 19.4 overs.Laxmi Saud picked two wickets for Sudurpaschim. Janaki Thapa, Joshi, Kanoujiya, Sneha Mahara and Bindu pocketed one wicket apiece.In the day’s other action, Koshi Province defeated Lalitpur Mayor’s XI by six wickets to register their first win of the tournament. Apsari Begam took 3-25 and Alisha Khadiya returned the figures to 2-9 to help Koshi restrict Mayor’s XI to a low total of 88-9.Ashma Pulami Magar top scored for Mayor’s XI. She was unbeaten on 26 not out. Kiran Kunwar provided the second highest score with 13 runs.In reply, Kajal Shrestha and Tika Shah played a 56-run stand for the second wicket to guide Koshi to victory.Shrestha scored 36 runs off 45 balls, while Shah made 25 off 34 balls.On Friday, Sudurpaschim will face Bagmati Province in the last group fixture.The final will take place on Saturday.  \nA team of high-altitude sherpa guides recovered the body of a Mongolian climber from Mt Everest after four days, the first casualty of this spring climbing season.The search and rescue team found the body at the point of 8,600 metres, hooked in the fixed ropes of Everest, the expedition organiser said. Details of his death were unclear.The two Mongolians—Tsedendamba Usukhjargal, 31, and Lkhagvajav Purevsuren, 53, have been reported missing since Monday.“The rescue team spotted another body at 8,400 metres, a bit far from the fixed ropes,” said Pemba Sherpa of the 8K Expedition company that provided support services to the Mongolians up to their base camp. “They [the rescue team] were not sure whether it was the body of another Mongolian. They have taken a photo and descended to the base camp to verify it,” he said. “It will be verified by Saturday.”Pemba Sherpa, however, said that they have been discussing with the families whether to retrieve the body from the death zone, above 8,000 meters where oxygen is thin.. “It requires a huge amount of money—at least $70,000 to bring the bodies back.” “We have to mobilise at least 10 sherpas to bring the bodies from one of the dangerous points of the earth. From the lower reaches, the bodies should be airlifted by helicopter.”According to the new rule of Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, in case of the death of a mountaineer, the guides, the trekking and travel agencies concerned shall be responsible for managing the body.On April 4, the Mongolian National News Agency reported that Mongolian mountaineers D Otgonkhuu, TS Usukhjargal and L Purevsuren would depart on April 5, 2024, to climb Everest, the world’s highest peak.“This time, it will be special as they will climb for the first time among the Mongolian mountaineers, not using any additional oxygen and without a guide. The three Mongolian mountaineers plan to conquer 8848.86 metres high Mount Everest by June 1, 2024,” according to the new agency report. \"They are the members of the Hunnu hiking club who decided to carry all the luggage themselves from the base camp and do the camping themselves.”Of the three members, two set off last weekend from their final camp at 8,000 metres for the summit. They were last spotted by another climbing group at Camp IV, the final camp, on May 13 at 8:45 am. Since then, they lost contact with the Everest base camp officials.Bad weather and high winds hampered any search for the missing climbers in the death zone.Everest is the world’s tallest summit at 8,848.86 metres, and according to the Department of Tourism, there have been more than 8,300 summit ascents from the Nepal side since the mountain was first scaled by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953.World record holder Kami Rita Sherpa reached the top of Mt Everest for the 29th time on Sunday, breaking his own record for the most summits of the world’s highest mountain. \nNineteen-year-old Amit, who’s currently in his gap year, started vaping two years ago. He says he isn’t addicted to it—he barely experienced any withdrawal syndrome when he quit it last year, before picking it up again. Amit, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym to protect his privacy, says he vapes just because he wants to.Unlike Amit, Rita (name changed), who is 21, switched to vaping after smoking tobacco for a while. Rita says that since she hopes to quit smoking altogether, she doesn’t mind the Nepal government’s intention to put a blanket ban on e-cigarettes. But doctors say a ban may lead those who smoke vape to switch to smoking tobacco again.As debates continue around the world about the pros and cons of vaping compared to smoking tobacco, the Nepal government earlier this month announced that it was banning e-cigarettes. The National Health Education, Information, and Communication Center (NHEICC), under the Department of Health Services, says it is seeking help from other ministries to enforce the ban. While some vape users the Post talked to said that the ban would help them quit smoking altogether, there are other aspects of the ban that need a more careful consideration for youths’ health, experts say.Meanwhile, some other users said banning vapes makes little sense as tobacco cigarettes are still freely available in the market for people of all age groups. If the government is so concerned about youths’ health, they question, shouldn’t stricter measures be taken to ensure that minors, for instance, don’t purchase cigarettes?Nepal is not the only country to ban e-cigarettes of late. Most recently, the British prime minister announced a ban on all disposable cigarettes, citing risks to youth health following a significant rise in vaping.There are 33 countries that have altogether banned the sale of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), while according to a WHO report published in early 2024, around 74 countries have no regulations on the sale of e-cigarettes.Most countries in the world have a legal age to purchase traditional cigarettes, according to the WHO, while 88 countries have no minimum age limit to buy e-cigarettes.Moreover, the WHO has repeatedly urged countries around the globe to reduce the spread of e-cigarettes. A call to action was published in December last year, urging governments to strengthen regulations on e-cigarettes.Nepal, meanwhile, has no regulations on e-cigarettes. While they haven’t banned e-cigarettes outright, countries like China have imposed a number of regulations, including licensing to sell the products publicly, ban on flavoured products, and imposition of taxes.In a study on the prevalence of e-cigarette usage among undergraduate students in Kathmandu, 21.2 percent respondents said they never used e-cigarettes, while five percent said they currently used cigarettes. An estimation of global e-cigarette use put the number of its users at 82 million worldwide, 14.2 million of them in South Asia.Most countries cite e-cigarettes as a contributor to youth smoking.Nepalis do not need to produce an ID to purchase either tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Amit, for instance, was still a minor when he started vaping. That these harmful products are freely available to people of all age groups goes against the Tobacco Products (Control and Regulatory) Act, 2068 (2011), which says that it is illegal to sell tobacco products to those below the age of 18.“A stricter control on the sale of tobacco products is essential to curb smoking among youths,” says Dr Bhakta Bahadur KC, chief of Health Promotion and Tobacco Control at NHEICC. KC adds that to prevent minors and pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to the risks of smoking, from purchasing cigarettes, local governments should introduce provisions on licensing. “This is one way to control smoking in vulnerable groups,” says KC.Moreover, banning e-cigarettes fully may not be possible as they are widely sold through social media and smuggled products might still be available for purchase online. The NHEICC is currently calling on other ministries, including the Ministry of Information and Technology, and the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, to help it ban e-cigarettes as they are imported from foreign markets.“Right now, the NHEICC is focused on banning e-cigarettes as a whole due to its adverse effects on the health of young adults, and its role as a gateway to tobacco smoking,” KC says.But Dr Augraj Uprety, Doctor of Medicine at the BPKIHS Department of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine in Dharan, provides a different perspective. With the ban on vapes, youths may find themselves attracted to tobacco smoking, as a significant number of vape users, like Rita, turn to e-cigarettes, supposedly to protect themselves from the harmful impacts of tobacco cigarettes.“Banning e-cigarette is not a cure-all,” Uprety says. “It is also vital to focus on handling the nicotine-dependence syndrome which both tobacco and e-cigarette users experience.”Both tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly addictive chemical, but tobacco cigarettes contain higher amounts of toxic chemicals than e-cigarettes. But studies show that e-cigarettes are especially harmful for youths as they affect adolescent brain development due to exposure to nicotine, and the aerosol in e-cigarettes has known effects on lungs.Further, there is little knowledge about the long-term impacts of e-cigarettes as it’s a relatively new technology.“I will never say banning e-cigarettes is a bad thing. It is an important move,” Uprety says. “But we also need to conduct a pilot study to figure out the repercussions of a potential ban.” \nSudurpaschim set up APF finalBindu Rawal’s team defeat Bagmati Province by 109 runs in the last group fixture in Kirtipur to advance into the final as group runners-up.SPORTS BUREAUKATHMANDU, May 17Sudurpaschim Province progressed into the final of the Lalitpur Mayor Women’s T20 Championship defeating Bagmati Province by a massive 109 runs at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Friday.Sudurpaschim’s opponents in the Saturday’s title match will be defending champions Armed Police Force Club, who are the most successful side of the tournament having won all of previous three editions.APF, who are bidding to a record-extending fourth Lalitpur Mayor T20 crown, are the only side to have maintained a perfect run in the tournament. They progressed into the final as group winners after accumulating eight points from four matches.Sudurpaschim became group runners-up with six points.Samjhana Khadka scored an unbeaten half-century—her second fifty of the tournament—while Rubi Poddar, skipper Bindu Rawal and Kabita Joshi were also impressive with the bat.Openers Poddar and Khadka gave Sudurpaschim a strong start scoring 60 runs for the first wicket, before Poddar departed in the ninth over making 28 runs off 36 balls.Khadka then put on a 43-run stand with captain Rawal for the second wicket to put Sudurpaschim in the driving seat.After Rawal departed for 28 for 23 in the 15th over, caught by Krishma Gurung, Khadka completed her fifty off 35 balls and added another 54 with Kabita Joshi for the third wicket to post a big 157-2 from 20 overs.Khadka ended her innings unconquered on 74. Her 47-ball knock featured 10 hits to the fences.Joshi was not out on 20 runs.In the chase, Bagmati were all out for just 48 runs in 16.1 overs, thanks to a lethal bowling from Ritu Kanoujiya who took 3-5 in her magical four over spell that also included one maiden over.Joshi and Laxmi Saud were also outstanding with the figures of 2-16 and 2-5. Except Gurung (16), none other Bagmati batters could score in double digits.Rawal and Karishma Thapa also took one wicket apiece for Sudurpaschim.The tournament features five teams, including Mayor XI along with four teams reaching the playoff round of the 2023-24 Prime Minister Cup Women’s T20 National Cricket Tournament.APF, Koshi Province, Sudurpaschim and Bagmati entered the Lalitpur Mayor T20 as teams reaching the PM Cup playoffs. APF won the tournament that was held from December 21, 2023 to January 3, 2024.Mayor’s XI consists of players from the remaining four teams—Madhesh Province, Lumbini Province, Gandaki Province and Karnali Province—who failed to qualify for the Prime Minister Cup semi-finals. \nA 1.43-km-long tunnel breakthrough on the Kathmandu-Tarai expressway was achieved on Friday.The final point of one of a ‘twin tube tunnel’ at Lendanda has been completed and preparations for the completion of the other one are underway, said Brigadier General Gaurav Kumar KC, also the spokesperson for the Nepal Army.Of the 1.63-km-long tunnel at Dhedre tunnel site, 1.506 kilometres have been cleared and only 124 metres remain, KC added.Likewise, only 1.197 kilometres of the Mahadevtar tunnel, the longest in the project, is left to be cleared of the total 3.355 kilometres.The Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway, or fast track, connects the capital city and Nijagadh in southern Nepal with a 76-km highway. Once completed, it will cut the current travel time by several hours. With 11 km in bridges and 6 km in tunnels, the expressway is more complex than any road construction project Nepal has undertaken before. The Nepal government on May 4, 2o17 formally handed over the project, under the Department of Roads, to the Nepal Army. The national force started building the multi-billion-rupee project in August of the same year with a four-year completion target.However, in December of 2023, Nepal Army Chief Prabhu Ram Sharma, presenting a bleak picture of progress at a parliamentary committee meeting, said that the highway might not be ready even three and a half years from then.The project has been split into 13 packages, with the army yet to award contracts for the 6.5 km area at the Khokana-Bungamati area in Lalitpur, Makwanpur and Nijgadh, due to land acquisition at the entry point yet to be completed.So far, the expressway has made an overall progress of 33.99 percent. \nAs the midsummer heat threatens to bring a wave of the loo in the plains of Tarai-Madhes, all eyes are on the sky, expecting a spell of cloudbursts and rain. But once the monsoon enters in less than a month, we will be back to running for shelter. This year, Nepal, like much of South Asia, could experience above-normal monsoon rains, the result of La Niña, a condition associated with normal to above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall over much of South Asia. Technical experts at the 28 sessions of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum (SASCOF-28) held in the last week of April said the second half of the southwest monsoon season will likely develop La Niña. This will also mark the realisation of the fear of two extremes—of heat and rain—in South Asia this year.While we stand to make some windfall from the wet climate, especially in the agricultural sector, there is a huge cost attached to the onslaught of heavy monsoon rains—landslides and flooding. Each monsoon, we fear the worst disasters but make little preparation to deal with them. And if we do not prepare in advance, the bounty we expect from the monsoon will soon turn into bane. Last monsoon, Nepal witnessed 328 events of landslide, 166 events of heavy rain and 59 events of flooding, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). Ninety-six persons were killed in landslides, 19 in floods and eight in heavy rains. This means that our existing mechanisms of defence against destruction will probably not work. We might face similar or even bigger catastrophes this year, too, if we do not prepare well.But as of now, news reports about advanced preparation for disasters are hardly positive. If the unitary state of the past was inefficient in dealing with disasters, the federal state of Nepal has its own complications. While authorities at the NDRRMA complain of a lack of human and financial resources to deal with large-scale disasters, the local levels, which are the closest and the most accessible forms of the state to the people, have similar woes. The familiar problem of a lack of coordination between the three tiers of government stands to dampen our disaster preparedness and response actions.Another set of disasters that comes as part of the monsoon each year is water-related epidemics. Each monsoon enters with the risk of dengue, malaria, and cholera. And it is in these crucial times that our health care system does not function optimally, with health centres in several parts of the country failing to provide basic medicines and care. We cannot make lethargy a habit and wait for disasters. From daivi prakop (divine disasters) to prakritik prakop (natural disasters), we have made some advances in our understanding of disasters. It is now time to consider disasters manaviya prakop—the result of human actions—and intervene on time for risk reduction and long-term resilience. \nThe aspirations of multiple generations are tied to a nation’s development through experience, expertise, skill, new ideas and innovation. This lays the groundwork for a thriving society where each individual plays a vital role. For such a vision to come to fruition, it is essential to effectively utilise human resources. However, the question persists: How can a nation tap into the potential of its young workforce, ambitious achievers, learners, experienced retirees, migrant returnees and vulnerable populations primed for empowerment through education?Consider the management of police and military personnel on the verge of retirement, mainly those retiring in five years. In the past fiscal year, 5,961 police personnel chose voluntary retirement. One wonders what happens to their preparedness for combat and mindset regarding deployment after retirement and when retirement time approaches. The security mindset ingrained in police forces and militaries demands perpetual vigilance, rigorous training and an unwavering commitment to upholding public safety through proactive assessment and decisive action when required. There is a need to balance the seasoned and disciplined attributes they hone over the years.Comprehending the present challenges faced by students in Nepal is another aspect worth considering, as it can offer valuable perspectives on the employment scenario. Recent findings from the first-ever textbook audit report conducted by Education in Every Home, an organisation working on the education sector in Nepal, paint a stark picture: Only 75 percent children complete 8th grade, with a mere 27 percent advancing to 12th grade. How can the diverse youth receive the support they need from the government and society to enhance their thought processes and effectively utilise their potential when they don’t complete their education? Enhancing human resource management for those on the brink of retirement and promoting youth employment demands more than abstract notions. Practical steps are required to unite people of all ages. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and mentorship programmes is paramount. Moreover, it’s imperative to foster connections among eager learners, individuals seeking guidance and those who derive fulfilment from careers like police and military service. By valuing these professions and harnessing the spirit of youth, we can create a more dynamic and impactful community. Yet, beyond these efforts, we must explore innovative strategies to effectively manage human resources and combat unemployment. Tackling unemploymentThe unemployment problem can be tackled in two ways. First, the government can emulate the historical approach of Franklin D Roosevelt, who galvanised the “lost generation” to pioneer civilian conservation corps initiatives in forestry, flood control and infrastructure enhancements in the United States. As Homraj Acharya, a seasoned policy expert with extensive experience in US government and development projects in South Asia, contends, the Roosevelt approach left an indelible mark on the physical, psychological and employability facets of three million individuals enrolled in the programme. Their involvement in economic relief and conservation efforts offers a blueprint for modern initiatives tackling poverty and environmental concerns. Enrollees resided in camps, engaged in various projects and underwent rigorous training and education within the corps. This precedent offers a compelling model for addressing unemployment, poverty and environmental conservation.Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt’s visionary approach, Nepal could mobilise individuals nearing retirement age to establish a development brigade. This could enlist 50,000 individuals with approximately five years left until retirement, comprising 5,000 from the police force, 5,000 from the military and 40,000 from civilian sectors. The government can allocate additional funds to boost the salaries of police and military officers nearing retirement for joining the development brigade. These individuals can undertake infrastructure development, community enhancement, park innovation, river and lake clean up and conservation, road construction, solar panel installations, reforestation, herbs production and processing and unused productive land utilisation. This strategic initiative addresses unemployment and capitalises on valuable skills and expertise for national advancement. By offering meaningful employment opportunities in these sectors, Nepal can harness their skills and experience, reducing unemployment rates. This targeted approach would ensure continued workforce contribution and alleviate the financial burden on social welfare programmes, ultimately promoting more excellent economic stability and societal resilience.Second, to actively engage youth and students in meaningful work, introducing service learning—an educational approach—can inspire them to participate in community-based projects, nurturing awareness, empathy, critical thinking skills, leadership abilities, teamwork, cultural competence, communication skill and a sense of social responsibility. The mandatory service-learning project for high school students can be easily connected to the development brigade initiative, suggests Acharya. The programme, also known as community learning or experiential learning, can foster collaboration between universities, businesses, nonprofits and government entities, benefiting the local community. Through service-learning courses, students earn credits while undertaking hands-on experiences such as office work, fieldwork, journaling and reflection papers. They can expand professional networks, cultivate friendships, enhance well-being, build confidence, confirm career interests, and explore new fields of study. Introducing the concept of service learning, which can later evolve into the digital literacy brigade, can facilitate a smooth transition from acquiring practical skills to addressing unemployment for the youth and students of Nepal. As students engage in hands-on experiences during service-learning courses, they cultivate crucial skills for navigating the generational realm, enhancing employability and contributing to workforce readiness. This will ultimately benefit the country through a more skilled and capable workforce fostering economic improvement. Such initiatives provide practical solutions and promote a unified responsibility for societal progress. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and meaningful employment opportunities shall ensure that everyone, regardless of age or background, can meaningfully contribute to the nation’s advancement. By grasping the importance of intelligent human resource management and investing in the growth of citizens, Nepal can build a rock-solid base for a vibrant and challenging society. Here, every single member steps up to mould the shared future.Nepal is a development professional and co-founder of Education in Every Home. \nMore than two years after Russia invaded Ukraine, the West, remarkably, still lacks a unified strategy. Though it has supplied desperately needed weapons and ammunition, it has done little else to address Ukraine’s needs.What would an effective strategy look like? For starters, Western governments need to establish shared goals. Ukraine must expel Russian forces and recover all the territory that it has lost since 2014; Russia must be forced to pay war reparations to compensate Ukraine (the World Bank estimates that reconstruction will cost about $500 billion over the next decade); the thousands of Ukrainians who have been deported to Russia must be allowed to return; and the tens of thousands of suspected war crimes committed by Russian troops must be prosecuted and punished.The West can no longer get away with promising to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.” Rather than holding Ukraine back from attacking Russian strategic and military assets, it should welcome such strikes. Losing the war is the best thing that could happen to Russia. Historically, military defeats have usually led to reforms and a change in leadership – as happened after the Crimean War (1853-56), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), and the war in Afghanistan (1979-88). Vladimir Putin has re-introduced Stalinist-level repression and opted for eternal war, a project that is likely to end in his demise. While it is ultimately up to Russians to effect regime change, the West should welcome the prospect.Many believe that Russia has the advantage in a long war, simply because its population and economy are larger than Ukraine’s (though the United States was defeated in Vietnam and Afghanistan after long wars). Whatever the case, a longer war undoubtedly will cost everyone much more. As such, the West should return to former US Secretary of State Colin Powell’s Gulf War tactic of “shock and awe” to bring about a Ukrainian victory.That means delivering all the best conventional arms to Ukraine as soon as possible, rather than continuing the current drip-feed of old weapons. Nobody can put such weapons to better use than Ukraine’s skilful soldiers. If Ukraine were to lose, Russian forces would march further into Europe to fulfil Putin’s neo-Czarist ambition of restoring the Russian Empire. Since Ukraine’s people are fighting and dying to defend Europe, the least the West can do is give them all they need to win. Denmark and the Baltic states have set an example others should follow.Specifically, the West should furnish Ukraine with potent long-range weapons—such as ATACMS and Taurus missiles—as well as a strong air force, so that it can gain supremacy over the skies. With thousands of Westerners having volunteered to fight for Ukraine on the front lines, why shouldn’t Western pilots join, too? Ukraine needs proper air defense. Absurdly, the West has made Russia, rather than Ukraine, a no-fly zone.The eminent retired US Generals Ben Hodges and Philip Breedlove have long argued that Crimea is likely to be decisive. Similarly, in the mid-nineteenth century, Pavel Nakhimov, an admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy, observed that whoever controls Sevastopol (Crimea’s largest port) controls the Black Sea. Clearly, Ukrainian control of that city should be a major strategic goal. To cut Russia off from Crimea, Ukraine also will need to destroy the Kerch Strait bridges to the peninsula.To force Russia to pay war reparations to Ukraine, the West should confiscate the $300 billion of Russian central-bank reserves that it has frozen. Canada and the US have already adopted laws authorising such a move; they should follow through, and the European Union should follow suit. It is unconscionable that Russia can violate international laws with abandon and still have its property shielded in the West. As long as the war continues, the West will need to provide Ukraine with $100 billion per year—$50 billion at least in military assistance, $40 billion to finance the civilian government, and $10 billion in humanitarian assistance.While Western sanctions on Russia have had some bite, they must be strengthened. Owing to the existing sanctions, the Russian economy has not grown since 2014, and its export revenues fell by 26 percent last year. But to tighten sanctions further, all Western governments should impose prohibitive tariffs on all imports from Russia—as the EU is currently doing with respect to Russian agricultural goods. Western countries have already rescinded Russia’s most-favoured-nation status, and bounded tariffs permitted by the World Trade Organization are very high. Since Western countries trade so little with Russia, higher tariffs will no longer have any meaningful impact on their domestic inflation. And since the customs system functions well, enforcement problems would be minimised.During the Cold War, Western governments cooperated through the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom), headquartered in Paris. That body should be restored to ensure more effective control over sensitive exports to Russia. Personal sanctions also need to be coordinated, reinforced, and streamlined. All sanctioning jurisdictions should agree on similar rules, impose the same sanctions, and exchange classified information about the reasons for them.Meanwhile, Russians who condemn the war and withdraw from Russia should be delisted in all jurisdictions. Secret ownership in the West by sanctioned oligarchs should no longer be tolerated. Similarly, the West needs to start thinking about how to penalise Western companies that continue to work in Russia and support the Russian government with taxes and other benefits. One reasonable idea is that they be forced to pay penal taxes commensurate to what they pay to Russia.Finally, the EU should start accession negotiations with Ukraine, and NATO should use its 75th anniversary summit in Washington in July to extend a formal membership invitation to Ukraine. A large majority of NATO members already supported doing so at last year’s summit in Vilnius. There is no reason not to follow through this year as part of a broader unified Western strategy.-Project Syndicate \nThe three branches of the government function through a system of check and balance. When one of the executive, the legislative or the judicial branches exceeds its bounds, the others remind it of its constitutional limits. In the post-1990 democratic setup, the judiciary for one has by and large played a positive role in upholding democratic values that had repeatedly come under assault, particularly by the executives who refused to accept any limits on their powers. Yet of late some questionable verdicts of the top court in the country have raised the spectre of a ‘judicial supremacy’. On May 3, a division bench of the Supreme Court raised many eyebrows when it ruled that the Speaker of the Gandaki Provincial assembly should not be counted as an assembly member in the government formation process. So, in the 60-member assembly, even 30 members could constitute a majority. Back in March 2021, in a highly unanticipated decision, deciding what was essentially a petition challenging the party’s name, the court dissolved the ruling Nepal Communist Party. A couple of months later, the court even appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba the new prime minister. As there are disputes on government formation in nearly each of the seven provinces, the Supreme Court could time and again be asked to settle them, just like in Gandaki. That is not all. The decision on judging the legality of the recent split of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal also now rests with the top court. What we repeatedly see is that the court is being asked to rule on what are essentially political disputes. If there was even a minimum level of understanding among our major political actors, many of the disputes in the provinces could have been settled among themselves. In other words, it is our major political actors who are inviting judicial activism. This in turn undermines the credibility of the judiciary. Yet that is only one worry. If our political actors continue to turn to the courts to handle all major and minor political disputes, then we should not be surprised if the third branch of the state starts acting more and more arbitrarily. There is then also the risk of the courts being cooped by other power centres, as is the case, say, in our neighbouring Pakistan or Myanmar. In order to uphold its image as a neutral interpreter of the constitution and other laws, the judiciary could do its bit by declining to hear cases of certain nature that are best decided through political dialogue, or through healthy discussions in the sovereign parliament. Our political actors should also learn to act more maturely. Yes, the kind of electoral system the country has is unlikely to ensure a high level of political stability. Yet our politicians cannot get away by putting all the blame on the system. They too must learn to show at least a minimum level of political maturity. Again, the democratic system only works through check and balance. If one organ of the state forgets its duties, the whole system destabilises.   \nThe Nepal Army on Thursday said that it has collected nine tons of waste and recovered two bodies as part of its ‘mountain clean up campaign-2024’.The bodies have been handed over to the Forensic Lab of TU Teaching Hospital, Maharajgunj, the army said.The campaign, which began on April 11, aims to manage 10 tons of garbage and five bodies from Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse, the Nepal Army Directorate of Public Relations and Information had said in a statement. The collected degradable waste will be handed over to local units, while the non-degradable waste will be transferred to organisations specialising in recycling waste.The Nepali Army says it believes the campaign, which is carried out annually by the force, will play a significant role in minimising the impact of environmental pollution and climate change. \nFrench police shot dead an armed man who set fire to a synagogue in the northwestern city of Rouen early on Friday, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and local officials said.Police, who were called to the site because of smoke coming out of the building, shot the man when he threw an iron bar at them and threatened them with a knife as he left the synagogue, a Rouen city official said.The fire had been brought under control, the official said.The synagogue suffered significant damage, including to its furniture, but no one was harmed, Rouen mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol said, adding that the Normandy town was “battered and shocked”.“An armed man somehow climbed up the synagogue and threw an object, a sort of molotov cocktail, into the main praying room,” Mayer-Rossignol told reporters.The attacker’s identity and motive were still unclear.France, like many countries across Europe, has seen a huge spike in antisemitic acts since Hamas’ October 7 deadly attack on Israel and Israel's invasion of Gaza in response.“It’s once again an attempt to impose a climate of terror on the Jews of our country,” Yonathan Arfi, president of the CRIF Jewish advocacy group, said on X.France hosts the Olympic Summer Games in just over two months and recently raised its alert status to the highest level against a complex geopolitical backdrop in the Middle East and Europe’s eastern flank.The synagogue was surrounded by a series of security cameras, Mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol said.\"Tonight is Shabbat and it is important to light the candles to show that we're not afraid, that we continue to practice Judaism despite the circumstances,\" Rouen's Rabbi Chmouel Lubecki, told BFM TV. \nThe meeting of the House of Representatives, scheduled for Friday, has been postponed to Sunday.General Secretary of the parliament secretariat Padma Prasad Pandey issued a notice to notify the lawmakers about the deferral of the meeting.Earlier, Speaker Devraj Ghimire had delayed the lower house meeting called for 11 am to 2 pm citing a lack of preparation. Main opposition Nepali Congress had demanded that the proceedings be rescheduled to Sunday. Following a discussion between Ghimire and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the meeting was deferred with plans to put more effort to forge an agreement with the political parties before continuing with the proceedings.The next meeting has been scheduled for 11 am on May 19.Congress lawmakers have been obstructing the proceedings of both lower and upper houses demanding the formation of a parliamentary committee to probe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane in alleged embezzlement of cooperatives funds.On Thursday, the parliamentary meeting took an unexpected turn as ruling and opposition lawmakers engaged in a scuffle after the Speaker allowed Minister Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and address the meeting.The meeting of the National Assembly, held earlier in the day, was also adjourned until 1 pm Sunday after obstructions from lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress. \nTaiwanese lawmakers shoved, tackled and hit each other in parliament on Friday in a bitter dispute about reforms to the chamber, just days before President-elect Lai Ching-te takes office without a legislative majority.Even before votes started to be cast, some lawmakers screamed at and shoved each other outside the legislative chamber, before the action moved onto the floor of parliament itself.In chaotic scenes, lawmakers surged around the Speaker’s seat, some leaping over tables and pulling colleagues to the floor. Though calm soon returned, there were more scuffles in the afternoon.Lai, who is to be inaugurated on Monday, won January’s election, but his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lost its majority in parliament.The main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has more seats than the DPP but not enough to form a majority on its own, so it has been working with small Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) to promote their mutual ideas.The opposition wants to give parliament greater scrutiny powers over the government, including a controversial proposal to criminalise officials who are deemed to make false statements in parliament.The DPP says the KMT and TPP are improperly trying to force through the proposals without the customary consultation process in what the DPP calls “an unconstitutional abuse of power”.“Why are we opposed? We want to be able to have discussions, not for there to be only one voice in the country,” DPP lawmaker Wang Mei-hui, representing the southern city of Chiayi, told Reuters.Lawmakers from all three parties were involved in the altercations, and traded accusations about who was to blame.The KMT’s Jessica Chen, from the Taiwan-administered Kinmen islands that sit next to the Chinese coast, said the reforms were to enable better legislative oversight of the executive branch.“The DPP does not want this to be passed as they have always been used to monopolising power,” she told Reuters, wearing a military-style helmet.Taiwan is a rambunctious democracy and fighting does on occasion take place in parliament. In 2020, KMT lawmakers threw pig guts onto the chamber's floor in a dispute over easing US pork imports.The clashes raise the prospect of more turmoil - and parliamentary conflict - ahead for Lai’s new government after it takes office.“I am worried,” said the DPP’s Wang. \nWith new photographic and video evidence, an Indian court battle over the origins of the world famous butter chicken is set to get spicier.Two Indian restaurant chains have been sparring since January at the Delhi High Court, both claiming credit for inventing the dish in a lawsuit that has grabbed the attention of social media users, food critics, editorials and TV channels across the globe.The popular Moti Mahal restaurant chain said it had the sole right to be recognised as the inventor of the curry and demanded its rival, the Daryaganj chain, to stop claiming credit and pay $240,000 in damages. Moti Mahal said founder Kundan Lal Gujral created the cream-loaded dish in the 1930s at an eatery in Peshawar, now in Pakistan, before relocating to Delhi.That “story of invention of butter chicken does not ring true” and is aimed at misleading the court, Daryaganj said in a new, 642-page counter-filing reviewed by Reuters.Daryaganj says a late member of its founding family, Kundan Lal Jaggi, created the disputed dish when he helmed the kitchen at the relocated Delhi eatery, where Gujral, his friend-cum-partner from Peshawar only handled marketing.Both men are dead, Gujral in 1997 and Jaggi in 2018.Evidence in the non-public filing includes a black-and-white photograph from 1930s showing the two friends in Peshawar; a 1949 partnership agreement; Jaggi’s business card after relocating to Delhi and his 2017 video talking about the dish’s origin.By virtue of the friends’ partnership, “both parties can claim that their respective ancestors created the dishes,” Daryaganj says in the filing, calling the dispute a “business rivalry”.Moti Mahal declined to comment. The judge will next hear the case on May 29.A key point of contention, which the court will have to rule on, is where, when and by whom the dish was first made - by Gujral in Peshawar, Jaggi in New Delhi, or if both should be credited.Butter chicken is ranked 43rd in a list of world’s “best dishes” by TasteAtlas, and bragging rights about who invented it can matter, brand experts said.“Being an inventor has a huge advantage globally and in terms of consumer appeal. You are also entitled to charge more,” said Dilip Cherian, an image guru and co-founder of Indian PR firm Perfect Relations.Moti Mahal operates a franchisee model with over 100 outlets globally. Its butter chicken dishes start at $8 in New Delhi, and are priced at $23 in New York.Late U.S. President Richard Nixon and India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru are among the famous clients to have visited its primary outlet in Delhi.Daryaganj started in 2019 and its butter chicken costs $7.50. It has 10 outlets, mostly in New Delhi, with plans to expand to other Indian cities and Bangkok.In its 2,752-page Indian lawsuit, Moti Mahal had also accused Daryaganj of copying “the look and feel” of the interiors of its outlets.Daryaganj has retorted with photographs of restaurant interiors which the judge will review, claiming it is Moti Mahal that has copied its “design of floor tiles”. \nNepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal faces a fourth floor test on Monday to retain majority after losing the support of a coalition partner.\nSunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nIn 2020, Nepal annexed disputed territory with India, reigniting tensions while political maneuvering and India-China relations play a role.\nNepal's 2022 Climate Change Survey reveals profound economic impacts on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, including economic losses of Rs415.44 billion in the last five years, water scarcity, new crop diseases, and biodiversity loss due to climate change.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nIn times of ongoing conflicts worldwide, Anay Ngawang Chodak, through his art, promotes the concept of ‘interconnectedness of existence’. He believes that by recognising our interconnectedness, we can work together toward positive change, promoting peace and harmony in a world that often feels divided.Chodak is a traditional Tibetan thangka master and contemporary artist. As a devoted Buddhist practitioner and direct descendant of the Repa Dorje Chang lineage—one of Jetsun Milarepa’s yogi disciples—he combines his rich heritage with modern artistic expressions.His solo art exhibition, ‘Opening Doors to Universal Inner Human Value’, is currently displayed at Kisimaaka Gallery in Thamel, Kathmandu. The exhibition, which started on April 6 and was initially planned to end on May 19, has been extended to May 23.In an interview with the Post’s Aarati Ray, Chodak shares insights on his art styles, the importance of ‘interconnectedness’ in today’s world and his new ‘wearable’ art collection.What styles of art do you create?I create various types of art, from Thangka and Tibetan to modern styles. My work combines Newa Paubha art, Kashmir’s Alchi art and Tibetan art, focusing on female energy as a divine source of wisdom.Can you tell us about your project with Kisimaaka Lines on wearable art?I’m collaborating with Kisimaaka Lines on a special project called the ‘Meditative Collection’. We design 100% cashmere shawls adorned with my Himalayan art. This project combines Himalayan beauty and elegance with colours, reminding us of universal human values of joy and harmony. By creating these wearable art collections, we aim to make Himalayan art more accessible and share the message of Himalayan culture globally.Your paintings often feature the theme of ‘Interconnectedness of Existence'. Can you explain this idea?In everything we do—what we eat, wear, think, and feel—there’s a theme of interconnectedness. We’re all connected and everything affects everything else. Good thoughts lead to good outcomes and bad thoughts lead to bad outcomes. Through my paintings, I want to emphasise this idea. Understanding our interconnectedness can help remind us that our actions impact others and that we share common human experiences and needs. This awareness can develop empathy, compassion and cooperation within us, reducing conflicts and helping to rebuild trust and unity. My art reminds us that we’re all connected and that practising kindness and compassion can bring us peace. In the digital and technology era, where people are becoming more isolated from each other, how important do you think staying connected is?Even in the digital world, I see interconnectedness. While there are negative influences, they still show how connected we all are, though in a less positive way. We need to spread positive messages more to harness the good side of interconnectedness.If we truly understand and practice interconnectedness, we can overcome jealousy, violence and negative feelings, leading to a world without conflict. We all feel pain, experience hunger and need water to survive. We must realise that at our core and soul, we’re not so different.Do you ever feel pressured to conform to traditional or modern art styles?I don’t feel pressured to conform to just one style. People often see traditional art as only depicting gods and deities, making it seem distant to the younger generation. However, I believe that Thangka art, traditional art and modern art all share the same essence.Contemporary art connects with our modern lifestyle and thoughts, while traditional art reflects human lifestyle and consciousness. On a deeper level, they’re all the same, so I use different approaches in my paintings to convey the same message.Traditional and contemporary art can communicate messages about good and bad deeds, showing their similarities. Therefore, I don't think we need to stick to or conform to just one style. How do you view ‘meditativeness’ in art?To me, meditativeness in art means cultivating good practices and habits. In a world of pessimism, it’s easy to fall into negative thoughts and behaviours. Practising meditative art involves propagating positive thinking and practices.With a free and boundless mind, there are no limitations. Barriers that once seemed insurmountable disappear, allowing us to see the world in a new light. Everything coexists without differentiation or separation in absolute freedom and unity. We should understand and appreciate the interconnectedness of all things and realise that we are part of a greater whole. What message are you trying to convey through the themes of female energy and divinity in your paintings?In the past, women and femininity were often looked down upon. However, both men and women have feminine and masculine qualities. We need to stop creating divisions based on these qualities. It’s high time we start celebrating femininity and women.Motherhood is the ultimate symbol of love. Even Buddha said that men and women are equal. For example, in my painting ‘Oneness’, I try to show a harmonious balance of masculine and feminine energies. When we move beyond our differences, we can appreciate and respect each other more deeply, allowing these energies to unite and flow beautifully.Just as a peacock uses poison to grow vibrant feathers, the snake skin on the female form in my painting represents transforming negativity into something positive. \nRishi Amatya is a writer, researcher, and heritage interpreter based in Mangal Bazaar. His works mainly comprise myth, history and culture. In addition to writing, he has written interactive and self-guided heritage maps for the Patan Museum and Hanuman Dhoka Museum. Radha: Wrath of the Maeju is his debut novel. In an interview with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Amatya discusses his first novel and why mythology is the focal point of his writing. How did you get into reading and writing?My mother was a primary school teacher and an avid reader, creating a home environment that encouraged reading. Our house was filled with a variety of books and magazines, such as Muna Patrika, Madhupark, and Yuwa Manch. Additionally, my friends and cousins had extensive collections of comic books, which further nurtured my reading habit.My writing journey began with my love for reading. After completing my SLC (now SEE), I started writing and took on various freelance writing jobs, including writing for websites. I wrote for a children’s magazine, ‘Young Harold’, covering different events. However, it wasn’t until 2006 that I began writing professionally. I contributed to Wave magazine, ECS and other publications, covering issues related to youth and culture.What is your first novel ‘Radha: Wrath of the Maeju’ about?The story centres on a girl named Radha, who once served as the Royal Kumari of Patan. As Kumari, she was confined to the Kumari Bahal, isolated from the outside world.After being dethroned, Radha longs to visit Mangal Bazaar and experience life as a normal girl. However, her world is shattered when an earthquake strikes, releasing demonic forces from another realm. These demons target Radha and her family. The book follows Radha’s struggle to do the right thing as she finds the courage to protect her family and the world she lives in.Do you follow any routines when you sit down to write? I try to write every day. When working on a piece, I aim to write 500-1000 words daily while drafting or writing a scene. I start writing whenever I have free time, striving to maintain consistency in my daily writing routine. Meeting deadlines demands extensive writing, so it’s essential to keep a steady writing schedule.How did you develop the characters of your novel? Are they purely fictional?All three main characters in my book are fictional, but they reflect people I’ve interacted with and dealt with in real life. Some of them are inspired by specific events in my life.Why did you choose to write on mythology?I aimed to create a story deeply rooted in our culture. Most fiction we read today is based on Western cultures, like Norse or Egyptian mythology.We often overlook Nepal’s rich and fantastic mythologies. We don’t revere our mythologies with the same reverence as Western ones. Additionally, there aren’t many literary works that interpret our society. I’ve always wondered what it would be like to set fiction in our Kathmandu Valley.To fill this gap, I crafted my book’s story to reflect our society’s current context, culture and our experiences as its people.What would you say to young writers?To excel in writing, it’s essential to keep reading and writing regularly. Exploring a wide range of books, both within and beyond your interests, can greatly enhance your writing skills.Reading books related to your field can significantly improve your writing process. Additionally, it’s important not to second-guess yourself or worry that your writing isn’t good enough. Self-censorship can hinder progress, so it’s crucial to write freely and confidently.What inspires you to write?I don’t have a specific individual as my source of motivation. Instead, I find inspiration in every author I’ve read. However, while working on my recent book, I was particularly inspired by the works of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novel series stands out as particularly satisfying. The series centres around a young protagonist and the evolution of this character is the most interesting part. Overall, I draw inspiration from the diverse range of authors I've read.What difficulties did you face while publishing the novel?One major hurdle I encountered while writing my book was the absence of editorial support. Fortunately, my publisher provided some editorial assistance. However, in general, securing editorial support remains a significant challenge for authors. Additionally, limited platforms are available for authors like myself to showcase our work.

On April 26, 2021, the Oli-led government allowed the use of the land exempting the ceiling for the deal. However, the constitutional bench, headed by Bishowambar Prasad Shrestha, ruled that Oli’s Cabinet decision contravened Section 12 (C) of the Land Act 1964 and was immature.The court also ruled against allowing the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding the legal ownership ceiling in any other place within Koshi Province, highlighting the legal implications of the land reforms.The requirement to first examine the specific land’s detailed area has been upheld by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench in the full text of the verdict. The land that is being considered for a swap ought to yield comparable value, read the court’s final verdict. But the tea estate is trying to swap its land in Birtamod, reportedly valued at Rs200 million per bigha, with low-price land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.While considering a swap, there must be a feasibility study to assess the new location’s production capacity. Technical experts’ advice ought to be followed in this context, reads the full text of the court.“It [the court verdict] has not just confirmed how wrong and corrupt the decisions and law amendments made by the government of the time were, but has also exposed policy-level corruption. There is no longer any doubt that such a decision is unfair and ill-intended. Therefore, further investigation is warranted,” Thapa wrote. When the Congress general secretary tried to bash the UML over the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate incident, UML chair Oli accused the Congress of selling 70 bighas of the estate in return for hefty commissions. Oli made the accusation while addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the UML on Wednesday. “The Congress should be careful when commenting on the UML on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate,” Oli said. “They once sold 51 bighas of land and later 19 bighas in the name of land swapping, just for commissions.”When the government in 2018 tried to swap the Giri Bandhu land, the court stopped it, saying there were no legal provisions to do so. “Abiding by the court’s ruling, we later formulated the law, but the court now has found the fault with it,” Oli said.The Congress has been cornering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane over his involvement in the co-operatives funds’ embezzlement. With this agenda the party also has been disrupting Parliament. But the ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being biassed against Lamichhane. And it is Oli and his CPN-UML party that has come to Lamichhane’s most resolute defence.The Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday decided to take up the issue of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in a serious manner.But Congress leaders deny that bringing up the tea estate issue is its calculated strategy to corner the ruling parties. “The parliamentary party meeting decided to take up this issue given the gravity of the matter. There is no ulterior motive,” Sanjay Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post. Meanwhile, Gautam also said the party will study Oli’s allegations against his party. When the Oli government amended laws related to land-swapping, Thapa of the Congress, who demanded an investigation into the Oli Cabinet’s decision, was a House member. Not only Thapa but most senior Congress leaders were members of Parliament at the time of the amendment.“Though one can question those involved in the law amendment on moral grounds, they cannot be held accountable on legal grounds,” Om Parkash Aryal, an advocate who was among those challenging the Oli government’s decision in the court, told the Post. “In such instances, it’s the government that makes such a decision which comes under the question.”King Mahendra’s implementation of land reforms in 2021 BS, through enacting the Land Act 2021 BS, was a momentous step. The law fixed the ceiling of land possession by individuals at 28 bighas in Tarai districts. The land exceeding the ceiling would be nationalised. Landlords close to the then royal palace were taken into confidence for the law’s implementation, and the palace made it clear that land used for industrial and agricultural purposes would not be nationalised.According to Section 12 of the Land Act 2021, land used for industrial, agricultural, cooperative farming, educational, or medical purposes is not put under the limit.Budhkaran Rajbanshi, a landlord in Jhapa considered close to the royal palace, was informed in prior that if he established a tea estate, the land beyond the ceiling would not be nationalised.To save his land, he founded the Budhkaran Tea Estate there. Three additional Jhapa landlords, the Giri brothers (Prem Kumar Giri, Krishna Kumar Giri, and Trilochan Giri) also received similar information. In Birtamod, Jhapa, the Giri brothers owned 500 bighas. Before the Land Reforms Act came into effect, the Giri brothers proceeded to register the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in order to safeguard the property. Land reform laws introduced later did not apply to the land as it had already been used for agricultural purposes. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel delivered the government's policies and programmes on Tuesday after the Nepali Congress lifted the obstruction in the House of Representatives. However, the disruption continued afterwards.President Paudel read out the policies and programmes of the government in the joint sitting of the federal parliament.The Congress then blocked the proceedings of both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly and did not let the assembly table a motion of expressing gratitude to the President for delivering the government’s annual paper.It is customary for Parliament to thank the President for reading out the annual policies and programmes. The parliamentary party meeting of the Congress on Tuesday morning, however, had decided not to allow Parliament to proceed after the head of state wraps up his presentation.The Congress later responded that the policies and programmes fail to address the problems of cooperatives’ victims. The main opposition has been protesting in Parliament, demanding a parliamentary probe into the issue of cooperatives around the country embezzling the deposits of hundreds of thousands of depositors. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane is the focus of the largest party’s fury for his alleged involvement in the cooperative scam. “Our position that the government has protected the people who have swindled cooperatives victims has been reconfirmed,” said Ramesh Lekhak, the chief whip of the Congress party, while talking to the media after the policies and programmes had been read out.The main opposition party was initially not ready to allow the smooth operation of the Parliament’s proceedings. The party even warned the government and the ruling partners that it would prevent President Paudel from presenting the government's policies and programmes should its demand go unheeded.The Congress has been disrupting Parliament, demanding a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane over allegations of cooperative funds embezzlement. Lamichhane has publicly refuted the charges and asked for a chance to make his case clear in Parliament.But the Congress has been preventing Lamichhane from speaking in the House. The Congress, which appeared tough against the resumption of parliamentary business, even the presidential appearance, had relented and agreed to let the President present the programmes. But it resorted to the obstruction soon after. In 2017, the CPN-UML, while in the opposition, had been obstructing parliamentary proceedings. It allowed then-President Bidya Devi Bhandari to present the annual policies. The opposition then protested the Cabinet’s decision to increase the number of local federal units in the Tarai in the midst of the elections. The party later obstructed the motion of thanks to the President.During Speaker Devraj Ghimire’s meeting with the party chief whips on Tuesday afternoon, before the President read out the government’s annual document, the Congress had announced its plan to continue to disrupt the House after the policies had been presented.“We will continue to interrupt the House until our demand is addressed,” Congress whip Sushila Thing told the Post. “As there is no parliamentary practice of barring the head of state to present policies and programmes, we too didn’t go that uncharted route.”The party will not allow other proceedings of the two houses for as long as it takes in order to get its demands addressed, Thing said.On Tuesday morning, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa and the party’s Chief Whip Lekhak met Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to discuss the issue of parliamentary obstruction. Dahal had requested the Congress leaders to allow a smooth functioning of the legislature. The Congress leaders also claimed that the prime minister seemed positive about addressing their demand.“While meeting our leaders, the prime minister seemed positive but he has not taken the necessary steps to honour the call of the main opposition,” Congress whip Thing said. Dahal’s openness to the formation of the probe committee was one of the reasons the Congress became ready to allow the President to present the policies and programmes. Shakti Basnet, the minister of energy, water resources and irrigation, claimed that the discussion between the government and Congress was headed in a positive direction.“Until late Monday night, the Congress was adamant on barring the President from presenting the policies and programmes. But on Tuesday, we reached an agreement to allow the President to do so,” Basnet, a Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, told the Post. “The government will similarly reach an agreement with the Congress on its demand for the probe committee.”According to the Congress leaders, Sunday's meeting between the prime minister and Congress leaders also concluded positively to address the party's demand. After the Congress leaders met Prime Minister Dahal, the party held the parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday morning. The same meeting allowed President Paudel to confer the government's annual policies and programmes. The ruling parties and the main opposition have been discussing smooth operation of Parliament for the past few days. However, given the inflexible positions of both sides, Tuesday’s session was expected to face trouble.“The ruling parties and the opposition need to come to a logical conclusion to open the parliamentary business,” UML whip Sunita Baral told the Post. “It looks like both sides only have discussed the issue at their ease. What we need is negotiation to resolve the issues of both Parliament and the cooperative scam.”The constitution mandates the government to present its annual budget on Jestha 15 (May 28 this year). For this reason also, the ruling and opposition parties need to close their ranks, Baral added.The ruling parties are ready to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the issues plaguing the cooperative sector. However, they are reluctant to constitute a committee with the mandate to probe Lamichhane. The Congress, too, is positive about a broad inquiry into the cooperatives, but it deems investigating Lamichhane in particular a necessity after various probes by police and other government bodies established his involvement in the scams. The Congress had disrupted the winter session of Parliament before it was prorogued on April 14, with the same demand. The party has also been obstructing the new session of Parliament that commenced on May 10. \nNepal’s regional political parties that emerged as prominent forces mainly after the political change of popular movement of 2006 have entered into a stage of disputes and divisions.On May 5, Ashok Rai, one of the top leaders of Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), along with some other key leaders, split the party and registered an application for a new party at the Election Commission. The election body registered the Janata Samajbadi Party under Rai’s leadership. Seven of the 12 federal lawmakers of the Yadav-led JSP-Nepal joined the Rai-led party.Yadav on Monday moved the Supreme Court challenging the Election Commission’s decision to register the new party, accusing the body of giving recognition to the Rai-led group as a new political party unconstitutionally. The case is sub-judice in the court.Yadav, who was deputy prime minister and minister for health and population in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government, resigned from his post on Monday. His party pulled out of the government.Later in the evening, Dahal appointed one minister and one minister of state from the newly formed party led by Rai.“With the resignation of our party’s ministers, our party has withdrawn its support to the government,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The JSP-Nepal’s parliamentary party leader Upendra Yadav, writing a letter to Speaker Devraj Ghimire, withdrew the party’s support to the government.On the other hand, the JSP-Nepal, which had been leading the Madhesh government since 2017, has been limited to a minority position after the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support to the provincial government. Yadav’s JSP-Nepal is the only party to get the opportunity to lead a provincial government continuously for seven years. With the UML and Maoist Centre withdrawing their support, it is almost certain to be out of power in the province for the first time in seven years.It is not only the JSP-Nepal that has split. In February, Rajendra Mahato, a key leader of the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), quit the organisation to announce his new campaign, Rastriya Mukti Andolan, literally the ‘National Liberation Movement.’Bijay Kumar Gachchhadar, who led the Madheshi Janaadhikar Forum-Democratic, merged his party with Nepali Congress. Once a powerful leader in national politics, Gachchhadar has now lost his influence in Madhesh as well.Hridayesh Tripathi, a prominent Madheshi leader, formed a separate outfit, the Janata Pragatisheel Party, over two years ago.A senior Maoist leader, Prabhu Sah from the Madhesh, also formed his own Aam Janata Party in December 2022.It is not only the traditional forces but also the emerging ones that are grappling with crises.The Nagarik Unmukti Party (NUP), which emerged mainly from the latest general election, has been embroiled in a factional dispute between party chair Ranjita Shrestha and her husband, Resham Lal Chaudhary. The rift caused the party to lose the opportunity to lead the Sudurpaschim provincial government last month.While Shrestha has joined hands with the Dahal-led ruling coalition, Chaudhary is lobbying to collaborate with Nepali Congress.The regional political forces, which had emerged as a serious challenge for mainstream political forces such as Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, have lost their influence drastically in the recent years, mainly due to intra-party feuds and divisions.“They try to agitate for their rights, but they also indulge in a politics of power, which contrasts with each other,” Tula Narayan Shah, a Madhesh-based political analyst, told the Post. “Probably one of their demands can be mustered through the protest, but the other can only be achieved from the House of Representatives.”Experts think that despite their shortcomings, regional parties’ relevance is still intact. “If the traditional regional parties could not prove their significance, they will be replaced by the new ones,” Lokraj Baral, a political analyst, told the Post. “However, the relevance of regional parties will remain intact.”He said that with the influence of Yadav diminishing in the province, CK Raut of Janamat Party is likely to take his position in the days to come if the latter can prove his credibility.Experts say that regional parties, rather than being driven to address the regional issues for which they were constituted, got diverted from their initial motives and became self-centered, culminating in splits.“When marginalised people constitute the party, those parties are often leader-centric,” Shah told the Post. “Parties where a single leader holds sway are less accommodative and more autocratic. Internal democracy is weak in those parties. As a result, they split.” \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n\nA man, who was injured while putting out a fire at Tapeshwar community forest in Godawari Municipality-4, Badikhel, succumbed to burn injuries on Tuesday.According to Senior Superintended of Police Shekhar Khanal of Lalitpur District Police Range, Shankar Pahari died while undergoing treatment at the Kirtipur-based Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre.Another injured, Ramesh Pahari, is being treated at the hospital.Meanwhile, a fire at Ananda forest in Godawari Municipality-6, Lele is yet to be brought under control. A total of 65 patients have been moved to a safer place after the fire spread to the premises of the Anandaban Hospital. \nNepal and Lithuania established diplomatic ties in February 2005. Nepal designated its Embassy in Copenhagen (Denmark) as a non-resident mission to Lithuania, and the Lithuanian Embassy in New Delhi represents Lithuania in Nepal. There have been minimal contacts and exchanges between the two countries. Trade, tourism and investment relations between the two countries are at a very low level. The Post caught up with Diana Mickeviciene, the ambassador of Lithuania to India, during her recent visit to Nepal to discuss Lithuania’s cutting-edge technology and its graduation to a developed economy, as well as bilateral economic, trade and tourism relations between the two small nations. Excerpts:Tell us about the bilateral economic and trade relations between Nepal and Lithuania.We are both small countries, far away from each other. But some trade is going both ways. For instance, we have exported medical cotton to Nepal in large quantities. And we have been buying tea and spices from Nepal. However, the trade amount is not very big. I think the biggest exchange we already have is the trade of services. Currently, there are some businesses that are trading services which are not reflected in the conventional trade balance. Our (Lithuania) economy is small but very innovative and digitalised. My country has gone far in more than 30 years of transformation. When we liberated ourselves from the Soviet Union, we were in shambles. Our economy was down completely, and people were very poor. But now we have graduated into a developed economy. We are considered a high-income country. So I think we've come a very long way. And what I see is Nepal is going a similar way. Nepal started slightly later, and the country is much bigger, with ten times Lithuania’s population. So challenges are, of course, more. And I think education is a big challenge. As we have done this transformation, we continue on digitalisation and on so many modernisation paths. This is the area we can help in advising and guiding because we just did it ourselves and we know how it works. I have been meeting a number of ministers to see which areas the Lithuanian expertise and experience could be best applied in the context of Nepal. So that's a new chapter that I want to open. You met Rekha Sharma, the minister for Communication, Information, and Technology. Can you share what issues were discussed?Since Lithuania ranks sixth in terms of cybersecurity globally, this is one area specifically where our expertise and knowledge could be very applicable, as Nepal has adopted a cybersecurity strategy and guidelines and is embarking on creating the National Cybersecurity Center. We have many companies which work in that area providing services to many others. For instance, the National Cybersecurity Center in Bhutan and the National Institution in Charge of Cybersecurity in Bangladesh were designed by a Lithuanian company. So we think that is what works well in this context. We would be happy to assist Nepal in the cybersecurity area. We could bring a group of experts to advise and guide Nepal. Exports and imports between Nepal and Lithuania have been declining. What should be done to boost bilateral trade between the two small nations for mutual benefit? The trade volumes are up and down and fluctuate year-on-year and this happens with many other countries. During Covid, we exported pharmaceutical agents for vaccines and the trade went up. But later, it declined because there was no need for it. So what we are trying to build now is high-tech cooperation which means the exchange of technology and services. This is one of the sectors which Nepal and Lithuania can exchange in future. We will never measure our relationship in conventional trade as the distance between the two countries is far. Also, nowadays, many producers who used to export have relocated to other regions and are producing in another country, thus changing the export origin, but the product remains Lithuanian. But of course, we need to work and check how our ICT sectors can work together. It's mostly private businesses. But as I said, as a very small but very dynamic government, we also have government-to-government proposals and solutions. So that's why I'm meeting in the ministry and trying to see the needs. We have a super strong laser industry. For decades, we have developed very good laser bays. The screens of an iPhone are cut by using a Lithuanian laser because we supply those laser cutting technologies to iPhone manufacturers—10 percent of the world's scientific lasers are from Lithuania. Our biometrics, which is part of a robotics system, companies have been working around the world and in South Asia helping to verify digital identities like those on voter lists or other registers. In India, the Aadhaar system has a tiny bit of Lithuanian technology used in it. So, we will always have a niche role, but whenever this expertise is needed, then we can really provide it.A small number of tourists visit Nepal from Lithuania. How can Nepal attract tourists from Lithuania?I have visited Nepal as a tourist twice, long ago and I think all of my friends have been to Nepal. We are a very small country and will always be small if you compare it to a much bigger country. Nevertheless, to attract tourists, there is a need to advertise a little more as I think Nepal has excellent things to offer for a reasonable price which is also very important. For now, I can see that almost every Lithuanian can afford a trip to Nepal. The Nepali embassy and travel agencies could also do a little more advertising. I, as a friend of Nepal, am very happy to say and testify to anyone who asks that it's a great country to visit. Be it cultural and religious tourism, mountain trekking, spa, or wellness, I think Nepal has everything. It's easy to reach because connectivity is really good. And it's easy to stay and enjoy as the country is not so super expensive, it's affordable. So what kinds of products are in demand in Nepal and Lithuania? I think from Lithuania it would be electronic devices, digital devices which are needed now in everyday manufacturing processes. For instance, in telematics, any production line with many vehicles or equipment must monitor how they all work. This is where Lithuania is again pioneering. We have 30 percent of India's market in the hardware of telematics. So a Lithuanian company is successfully working in India. It will be IT applications or IT-enabling hardware solutions that we are very good at. From Nepal I think lots of traditional exports could also be interesting as our way of thinking and understanding of fashion and interior is quite similar. For instance, we are a wooden culture. So for us, the idea of a cosy house is wood and textiles, which Nepal produces, which has an excellent market in Lithuania. But in the future, I think, with technologies, ecological farming products will be in demand as the population becomes aware of health and sustainability requirements and not just requirements but use for own consumption. So that's where anything that is ecological and sustainable gets traction, and that's a high-value thing already. It's not a simple potato or tomato, but it's made of ecologically grown products. So how can Nepal and Lithuania work together for mutual benefit? We are here to learn about the changes in Nepal, about the future needs, and about the areas where we are good. We are also here to exchange opinions on issues of global concern, like climate change, which has highly affected both Nepal and Lithuania. None of our countries are great polluters. We, too, are a very minor polluter, much below our obligations, in fact. So how small countries can be together to make sure that the world is really against further global warming is important. Further, I also stress to the Nepal government that we are very grateful for a very principled stance of Nepal vis-a-vis the Russian war against Ukraine. It's a war which is just next door, it's 500 kilometres from my home. Nepal, on a number of occasions, voted in the United Nations to say no to aggression. So I think we are also very grateful and appreciative. Also, we have this unique connection that I wanted to tell, which is a tiny, small, quaint language which was preserved in villages of our country as a very antique, ancient language that is very close to Sanskrit. Since Lithuanian is considered the closest living language, a sister language of Sanskrit. We have started this collaboration with academic institutions here, and Raghunath Adhikari from the Tribhuvan University defended his dissertation on the issue of linguistic similarities last year. And he is the first PhD in Asia to actually do this. So we are happy that we have this connection and he has become a friend of Lithuania. Through him we know about what is happening at the university. Tribhuvan University already has a Memorandum of Understanding with Vilnius University, which is our oldest and main university. So academic collaboration is also very important because there are people working also on technologies, and know-how, which ultimately lead to business cooperation.  \nA comprehensive guide for Pashmina export has been launched, aiming to facilitate small-scale businesses in Nepal. The trade facilitation guide to export Pashmina from Nepal was jointly unveiled by Myriam Ferran, deputy director general for International Partnerships of European Commission; Ambassador of the European Union to Nepal Veronique Lorenzo; Baburam Adhikari, joint-secretary at the Ministry of Industry; and Dhan Prasad Lamichhane, president of the Nepal Pashmina Industries Association, amid a function organised at the Nepal Pashmina Fibre Processing Facility in Lalitpur on Tuesday.The fibre processing facility, established with technical support from the EU-Nepal Trade and Investment Programme, was also inaugurated at the same event. The plant has been processing fibre collected from Chyangra farmers and supplying it to Pashmina producers.As part of the European Union’s broader support to strengthening the Pashmina value chain, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies developed the guide with technical support from the EU-Nepal Trade and Investment Programme implemented by the International Trade Centre.This guide is specifically tailored to enhance Nepal's Pashmina export endeavours in major international markets such as Japan, the European Union, the US, and the UK.The guide explains step-by-step processes, encompassing firm registration, licensing, directives, customs, shipment, and logistics procedures. Moreover, it offers insights into the import requirements specified by destination countries, shedding light on tariffs, quality standards, shipping costs, timeframes, and the essential documents needed, along with other crucial trade information.The ‘Nepal Trade Integration Strategy 2023’ identifies Chyangra Pashmina as a highly prioritised exportable product. Similarly, the 'Pashmina Sector Export National Strategy 2022-2026' aims to elevate Pashmina exports to the $75 million mark by 2026.Speaking on the occasion, Joint-secretary Adhikari said, “Nepal’s Himalayan Chyangra Pashmina holds a distinguished position in the international market due to its unique quality and cultural significance. The government of Nepal has designated Pashmina as one of the high-priority exportable products. The guide is poised to become a useful source of information about the process for Nepali Pashmina exports, offering comprehensive information about our destination markets.”Ferran said, “As a longstanding partner in Nepal's development journey, the European Union reaffirms its unwavering dedication to bolstering Nepal's prosperity through enhanced trade and investment avenues. This comprehensive guide serves as an instrument to support the Pashmina value chain to harness the immense potential of Nepal’s Chyangra Pashmian in the international market.” \nNcell, Nepal's largest foreign investor, launches \"Sadhain ON\" campaign, waiving unintended mobile data charges and reducing data plans to 20 to prepare customers for 5G.\nEU-Nepal Business Forum 2024 inaugurated by Prime Minister Dahal, emphasizing green economy, ease of doing business, and shared prosperity with EU investment.\nPre-monsoon rains increase dengue outbreak concerns, with alarming case numbers reported and experts urging preventive measures to avert a health crisis.\nDue to alarmingly rising maternal deaths, Nepal's Health Ministry plans to screen pregnant women for mental health issues, which have emerged as a major cause, aiming to cut down on preventable deaths and achieve UN's target of reducing maternal mortality to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.\nKathmandu Health Office trains 50 health workers to screen for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health problems in local health facilities.\nIn nine months of the current fiscal year, the Department of Drug Administration has tested 348 samples of medicines collected by its drug inspectors from across the country.Of nearly 20,000 medicines, both registered and unregistered ones in the market, drug inspectors had collected for testing hundreds of samples of drugs suspected to be substandard.However, the department, which is also the national regulatory body of the drug market, carried out tests on less than two percent of the total registered drugs in the country.“Some samples of medicines collected by our drug inspectors some 13 months ago are yet to be tested,” said Narayan Dhakal, director general of the department. “Some samples suspected to be substandard and collected for a quality test might already have expired.”Ensuring the quality of medicines being prescribed to patients is the responsibility of the department. Its drug inspectors collect samples of medicines on a random basis from the market and send them for lab tests at the National Medicines Laboratory under the department.Officials at the DDA said several samples of medicines on which quality testing was carried out in the current fiscal year were found substandard and recalled from the market.Dhakal concedes that the samples tested by the department are not sufficient to ensure the quality of the medicines.“We have tested too few samples,” an official at the department said. “And the fact is some medicines on which tests were done were found to be substandard, which means other drugs in the market also could be problematic. Patients might have been taking substandard medicines.”Experts say the use of substandard medicines could adversely affect patients’ health. Dhakal said that ensuring the quality of the medicines is also the responsibility of the drug manufacturing companies and it is not possible to test each and every medicine.“I must concede that we have not tested nearly enough medicines to ensure quality,” said Dhakal. “Several factors including understaffing are responsible for this.”Around 40 staffers have been serving in the National Medicines Laboratory under the department.Ensuring the quality of medicines in Nepal has always been an issue, as the national drug regulator grapples with a staff crunch, and its laboratory doesn't have the capacity to carry out timely tests.Drug inspectors deployed from the DDA take random samples of drugs and send them for testing to the government’s laboratory. If drugs are found problematic or substandard, the department directs the manufacturing companies to recall those drugs from the market. However, the department does not have an effective mechanism to ensure the recall either.In most cases, delays in testing at the laboratory mean that results come in only after all the substandard drugs in the market have been sold.While thousands of medicines manufactured by national as well as international pharma companies are being sold from pharmacies across the country, DDA inspectors collect only around 1,000 samples in a year. The inspection work is especially hard as the DDA has just around two dozen drug inspectors tasked with monitoring over 21,000 registered pharmacies and thousands of unregistered ones.Moreover, it takes several months to examine some medicines as the DDA’s laboratory is understaffed with several posts for technicians remaining vacant. The department allows the drug manufacturing companies to supply medicines to the market directly from the factory. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nIndia captain Sunil Chhetri, the country’s most prolific footballer, will retire from international football after the World Cup qualifier against Kuwait on June 6, the 39-year-old announced on Thursday.Chhetri has been the face of Indian football for nearly a decade-and-half and his 94 international goals make him the third-highest active international goalscorer after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.“It was not that I was feeling tired,” Chhetri said in a video he posted on social media.“When the instinct came this should be my last game, I thought about it a lot and eventually I came to this decision.”“Will I be sad after this? Of course...the kid inside me never wants to stop if given a chance to play for his country.”“It’s time for our country to see the next number nine.”Chhetri is also India’s most-capped player having played 150 international matches since his debut against Pakistan in 2005.“Your legacy on and off-the-field will always be remembered,” the All India Football Federation (AIFF) said in a post on X.“Thank you @chetrisunil11 for your leadership, dedication and commitment to Indian football.” \nThe 12th edition of the Kantipur Half Marathon is all set to take place on May 18.“Preparations for the 2024 Kantipur Half Marathon are now complete,” Mahesh Swar, chief executive officer of Kantipur Publications Limited, said during a press meet on Wednesday.This year’s half marathon, which carries a slogan ‘Run to inspire the young’, will feature men’s and women’s half marathon (21.1 km), Corporate run (5 km), college run (7 km) and wheelchair race (3 km).

More than 1,000 runners had participated in the first edition. The event has been continued annually since, establishing itself as one of the premier distance running events in the country.The first seven editions took place on the Publication’s anniversary day.The latter editions are being held on different dates in order to make the event a separate sports discipline, according to organisers.Tribhuvan Army Club’s Mukesh Pal and Nepal Police Club’s Rajpura Pachhai are the defending champions of the men’s and women’s titles of the 21.1 km race respectively.Kanchi Maya Koju is the most successful athlete in the women’s half marathon, having won five of the past eight editions.Hari Kumar Rimal has won the men’s half marathon four times. \nSantoo Shrestha on Wednesday made history by becoming the first Nepali table tennis player to qualify for the Olympics.Shrestha qualified for the men’s singles table tennis competition at the 2024 Summer Olympics after he defeated his compatriot Samyog Kapali 11-7, 8-11, 11-7, 11-6, 8-11, 11-9 in the final of the 2024 South Asian Qualification Tournament, which was held in Table Tennis Training Centre in Kathmandu.The 2024 Olympics is scheduled to be held from July 26 to August 11 in Paris, France.Shrestha had defeated Sri Lanka’s Chameera Ginige 11-7, 11-9, 6-11, 8-11, 11-3, 11-8 to enter the gold medal match, while Kapali was a 13-11, 11-7, 12-10, 11-7 winner against Jayasanka De Silva, also from Sri Lanka.Shrestha also became the third Nepali player to qualify for the Olympics after Sangina Baidhya at Athens 2004 and Deepak Bista in Beijing 2008. Both Baidhya and Bista are taekwondo players and practitioners.Nepal will be making its 15th appearance at the Summer Olympics since making a debut in 1964.Track and field athlete Santoshi Shrestha and badminton player Prince Dahal will also represent Nepal at Paris 2024.Santoshi and Dahal gained entry into the Olympics after receiving universality spots.Santoshi will participate in the women's marathon while Dahal will compete in the men's singles badminton event.Dahal will be the first badminton player from Nepal to participate at the Olympics. \nAfter sealing pledges of a “new era” of strategic partnership with China’s Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday is set to highlight the growing importance of trade near the Russian border in China’s northeast.Putin ends his two-day, red-carpet visit to China in Harbin in Heilongjiang province, which has long-running trade and cultural ties to Russia, touring a Russian-China Expo and a forum on interregional cooperation.Facing political isolation and Western sanctions over Russia’s two-year-old invasion of Ukraine, Putin is increasingly turning to China to support its war economy.Amid the pomp of a full state visit, Putin and Xi signed a joint statement on Thursday that hailed the “new era”, countering the US across a sweep of security and economic issues and a shared global view.“The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it,” Xi told Putin.“China is willing to... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world.”The joint statement fleshes out the “no limits” partnership the two declared in February 2022, days before Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into neighbouring Ukraine, launching the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two.Beijing is helping Moscow’s war effort by providing drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools, U.S. officials said last month, although China says it has not provided weaponry to any party.Russia’s isolation from other powers has fuelled its trade with China, which surged 26.3% last year to a record $240.1, Chinese customs data shows. Russia has overtaken Saudi Arabia as China’s top source of crude oil, with shipments jumping more than 24% despite Western sanctions.An editorial in China’s state-controlled Global Times newspaper on Friday cited the importance of burgeoning trade ties to the wider relationship, saying China had been Russia’s largest trading partner for 13 straight years.“These achievements are not easy and have been achieved by both countries overcoming various external challenges and unfavorable factors, highlighting the solid foundation of the China-Russia relationship,” the editorial said.Putin is flanked by a large trade delegation, which includes Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina.Others include the heads of Russia’s largest banks - Sberbank (SBER.MM), opens new tab CEO German Gref and VTB (VTBR.MM), opens new tab chief Andrei Kostin - billionaire Oleg Deripaska, top oil producer Rosneft (ROSN.MM), opens new tab chief Igor Sechin and liquefied natural gas giant Novatek’s boss, Leonid Mikhelson.It was not immediately clear if Putin would make any further stops in Asia. \nBritain’s food watchdog has applied extra control measures on all spice imports from India, it said on Wednesday, becoming the first to ramp up scrutiny of all Indian spices after contamination allegations against two brands sparked concerns among global food regulators.Hong Kong last month suspended sales of three spice blends produced by MDH and one by Everest, saying they contained high levels of a cancer-causing pesticide ethylene oxide.Singapore also ordered a recall of the Everest mix, and New Zealand, the United States, India and Australia have since said they are looking into issues related to the two brands.MDH and Everest—two of India’s most popular brands—have said their products are safe for consumption.In the most stringent crackdown so far impacting all Indian spices, the UK’s Food Standards Agency (FSA) said that in light of the concerns it has “applied extra control measures for pesticide residues in spices from India which includes ethylene oxide”.The agency did not elaborate on the exact steps it is taking.“The use of ethylene oxide is not allowed here and maximum residue levels are in place for herbs and spices,” James Cooper, Deputy Director of Food Policy at the FSA, said in a statement to Reuters.India’s Spices Board, which regulates exports, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. India is the biggest exporter, consumer and producer of spices in the world.In 2022 Britain imported $128 million worth of spices, with India accounting for almost $23 million, data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity website shows.MDH and Everest export their products to many regions including the US, Europe, South East Asia, Middle East and Australia.Indian regulators have also conducted testing of all spice products and inspected samples of MDH and Everest products, though no results have been made public so far.MDH has since 2021 seen an average 14.5 percent of its US shipments rejected over the presence of bacteria salmonella, a Reuters analysis of US FDA data has found.On Wednesday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency told Reuters in a statement it was aware of the concerns around MDH and Everest’s products and “continues to monitor the situation”.“Based on current information, we have no evidence to suggest that the issues raised affect products currently in the Canadian market,” it said. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nUsing electricity as a clean energy source in Nepal is crucial due to indoor air pollution caused by contaminating fuels, leading to health risks and deaths, while promoting e-cooking can boost domestic electricity consumption and reduce LPG gas imports, contributing to national development and sustainable energy goals.\nThe government will present the budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024/25 in a few days. In Nepal’s federal structure, functional responsibilities are devolved to the sub-federal levels while revenue remains centralised. The constitution aims to decentralise revenue through legislation. To achieve this, fiscal transfers to the sub-federal levels are ensured by the constitution. These fiscal transfers are done through four grants: Fiscal equalisation, conditional, special, and matching grants. Among these grants, the fiscal equalisation grant is vital; it is considered unconditional and includes full autonomy to the subnational governments.Between FY2018/19 and FY2023/24, all seven provinces received an average annual grant of Rs112 billion, while local levels received Rs261 billion. Annually, each province received an average of Rs16 billion and local levels received around Rs350 million in grants from the Government of Nepal. Although the local levels receiving Rs350 million yearly sounds positive from the outside, the situation looks disappointing from within.The principle of grants stipulates that the ratio of fiscal equalisation grants to the total budget or GDP should increase. However, this ratio has decreased. Consequently, the proportion of equalisation grants allocated to the sub-federal levels in the total budget was 10.27 percent in FY2018/19, declining to 8.34 percent in FY2023/24. This indicates a serious flaw in grant distribution, necessitating improvement. The situation is even more disappointing at the local level, where the percentage of equalisation grants among the four grants received was 41.38 percent in FY2018/19, with conditional grants comprising 53.74 percent. In FY2023/24, the percentage of equalisation grants decreased to 29.61 percent, while conditional grants increased to 65 percent. This highlights the disproportionate burden of conditional grants at the local level. The share of special and matching grants in the total grant is only 5 percent. However, the government has yet to understand the definition of a special grant. Matching grants will be distributed based on the demand of sub-federal levels to fill the resource gap in certain projects and programmes. The government will distribute the special grant based on the supply side after considering factors such as poverty scenarios, among others, at the sub-federal levels. Furthermore, this grant is also used to compensate for the Fiscal Equalisation Grant. The government has not yet considered this aspect, and it should seriously review all types of grant allocations, including special and matching grants.Grant distribution remains unfair, with no improvement in the trend of people visiting ministers and ministries for programmes and projects. From local government chiefs to federal parliamentarians, ministries are overcrowded. Many ministries allocate programme budgets at their discretion, with a significant portion favouring the constituencies of the prime minister and ministers. Subsequently, the budget is directed towards senior leaders, influential parliamentarians, secretaries, and so forth. This situation mirrors the pre-federalisation era, albeit with a slightly reduced budget being distributed haphazardly. During discussions on the ministerial budget for FY2023/24 in parliament, I raised concerns about the projects and programmes of certain ministries. The allocated program budget is even lower than that of previous village development committees.The World Bank published a report on Monday that was consistent with the facts stated above. Specifically, the report unveiled the 'Nepal Fiscal Federalism Update 2024', which aims to assess Nepal's progress in fiscal federalism and examine the alignment between the 2015 Constitution's fiscal federalism vision and present realities.The report reveals that fiscal balances of sub-federal levels slipped into deficit in FY2022/23 for the first time since the implementation of fiscal federalism in Nepal. Provincial governments recorded a consolidated fiscal balance deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in FY2022/23, attributed to decreased revenue and grants, which dropped to a record low of 3.5 percent of GDP. Conversely, expenditure saw only a marginal increase to 3.8 percent of GDP. However, there was notable variation in fiscal balances among provinces, ranging from a deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in Sudurpashchim to a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in Madhesh. Local governments also experienced a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in FY2022/23, stemming from a significant decrease in revenue and grants compared to the previous fiscal year. The report further highlights a decline in consolidated revenue and grants of sub-federal levels to a record low in FY2022/23, mainly due to reduced intergovernmental grants and revenue sharing. Provincial governments' revenue and grants dropped to 3.5 percent of GDP, driven by a decrease in intergovernmental revenue, constituting over 90 percent of provincial revenue. Local government revenue and grants declined to 8 percent of GDP in FY2022/23. Despite the decline in fiscal transfers from the federal to local levels, provincial transfers to localities remained unchanged. Notably, property taxes and local government service fees constituted over 70 percent of local governments' own-source revenue. Regarding expenditure, provincial government spending slightly increased to 3.8 percent of GDP, driven by elevated capital spending, particularly in infrastructure projects. Recurrent expenditure accounted for only 40 percent of total provincial expenditure. Conversely, local government spending saw a marginal decrease to 8.4 percent of GDP in FY2022/23 primarily due to reduced capital spending. A significant gap persists between sub-federal levels' expenditure and revenue, with only 8 percent of provincial spending and 6 percent of local spending financed by own revenue, leading to a marginal increase in the vertical fiscal gap in FY2022/23. The report also notes stagnation in own-source revenue collection, indicating moderate improvement in revenue assignment policies and weaknesses in revenue administration. It emphasises the necessity of upgrading institutional arrangements to manage the fiscal transfer system effectively. It highlights the absence of a legal provision/procedure for determining the pool of funds to be transferred through fiscal transfers and recommends increasing the ratio of Fiscal Equalisation Grants within the pool of resources to strengthen sub-federal levels' planning and decision-making. Moreover, the report suggests establishing transparent, consultative processes and technical methodologies for determining the divisible pool for fiscal transfers to enhance predictability and increase fiscal autonomy at sub-federal levels. The major challenge identified within the fiscal transfer system is the allocation of conditional grants, for which the bank proposes reducing conditional grants while enhancing fiscal equalisation, retaining conditional grants for federal responsibilities delegated to sub-federal levels, and allocating funds based on transparent criteria and procedures to align with the needs of sub-federal levels. Lastly, the report recommends determining and publishing grant amounts earlier in the fiscal year to facilitate improved planning and execution. Coming back to the budget, most ministries at the federal level act no less than those in the Rana era, with ministers often allocating budgets solely to their constituencies. Projects are frequently sent to the sub-federal levels as conditional grants. The constitution designates the province as the key entity for development, emphasising that infrastructure development should be led by the province, not the federal ministry—a principle underscored in the constitution. Out of the 22 ministries at the federal level, we need just between eight and ten, as more than half of the ministries overstep their jurisdiction. When presenting the budget, the government should embrace the spirit of the constitution and acknowledge the existence of provincial and local governments. \nAfter a months-long heatwave, the recent rainfall in Nepal brought much-needed relief and helped put out wildfires. Unfortunately, the rainwater, coupled with warmth, also created a favourable environment for dengue-carrying mosquitoes. As a result, dengue cases are already on the rise, with 57 districts reporting dengue infection, and over 50 cases were reported in a single week. Experts believe the worst is yet to come. Even though dengue has taken many lives in the past few years (20 deaths in 2023, 88 in 2022 and six in 2019) and infected many (52,000 in 2023, 54,000 in 2022 and 16,000 in 2019), it remains the most neglected virus. Authorities seem to care little either about its spread or severity. Nor do they try to understand the changing nature of the virus from climate change and rising temperatures through research and tests. A Dengue Action Plan is in place, but the government hasn’t been able to do enough to contain the spread of the virus except relying on traditional methods like surveillance of the virus, serotyping of the dengue-carrying mosquitoes, plus treatment, management and collaboration with local levels. Even the action plan acknowledges that the country’s dengue spread has gone out of hand, making it difficult to contain. Nepal is unable to undertake year-round surveillance and prevention programmes due to budgetary limits. The action plan clearly states that there’s no budget to deal with dengue throughout the year. This was bound to happen as the health ministry’s budget was reduced this fiscal year, discontinuing many programmes. Moreover, even the budget allocated for a particular fiscal year (for example in 2022-23) is used up before March/April, when cases usually surge. These months, as experts suggest, are crucial, as stopping the spread of the virus just when the cases are rising is the most effective way to cut down on the number of deaths and infections throughout the year. Apart from insufficient budget, the country also lacks entomologists, and no other ministry is held responsible for the work except health.The situation will only worsen the longer these challenges are overlooked. And removing the dengue menace should not be the sole responsibility of the health ministry. The finance ministry should allocate enough budget to drive dengue prevention measures for a whole year; the environment ministry can implement environmental policies to control the breeding sites of mosquitoes, and urge people to maintain sanitation and proper waste management; the urban development ministry must manage drainage systems and green spaces; while the transportation ministry needs to prevent the accumulation of stagnant water on roads. Only such a collective measure will help reduce dengue dangers.While continuing with awareness programmes, door-to-door campaigns and search-find-destroy drives should also be pushed on a regular basis. There is a strong case for learning from other countries. For instance, eDengue systems implemented in Malaysia could be used to report cases from rural parts of Nepal and detect severe cases for timely medical intervention. The onus is also on the public to take preventive measures on a year-round basis. Again, dengue is not something that only the government can control. If we don’t work together, many of us will needlessly suffer.  \nSenior leaders from seven major political parties—both the ruling as well as opposition forces—on Sunday made an unequivocal collective pledge to make maximum effort to promote the country’s investment and business climate. Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, CPN (Maoist Centre) vice-chair Pampha Bhusal, Rastriya Prajatantra Party chair Rajendra Lingden, Rastriya Swatantra Party Chief Whip Santosh Pariyar, CPN (Unified Socialist) General Secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal and Janamat Party chair CK Raut, while airing their respective party’s views at the Kantipur Economic Summit-2024, also emphasised the need for the political forces and other stakeholders to work hand in hand in order to attract investment.It was just two weeks ago that top leaders of the country including Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba of Nepali Congress and KP Sharma Oli, chair of a major coalition partner CPN-UML, while addressing the two-day Investment Summit, committed to spare no effort to turn Nepal into an investment-friendly destination. Presenting Nepal as a country of huge potential, the leaders made the promises before 1,600-plus representatives from 55 countries in the government-organised summit. Realisation of the need for domestic as well as foreign investments and joint political commitments of rival political forces in itself is a positive gesture.However this is not enough. Nepal’s politicians have time and again made such promises but failed to translate them into results. For that, Nepal still needs political as well as policy stability and predictability. Various countries have made tremendous progress even when there is instability in government leadership. They did so by keeping development activities separate from politics and ensuring policy predictability, even if there are constant changes in governments. One big concern of the representatives from the business communities expressed at the Kantipur Economic Summit was the same. They said genuine investors seek policy predictability as a prerequisite before making a sizable investment. This is a valid concern and the policy makers must ensure so much.Yet the initiatives of the government and our politicians appear more superficial than substantive. Just ahead of the investment summit, the government amended some Acts through an ordinance to clear legal complexities for investment. It was the government’s intent to create an impression before the international participants that Nepal is serious about getting money from abroad. But the ordinances couldn’t be tabled in the first meeting of the House of Representatives on Friday due to the ongoing obstruction of the main opposition party Nepali Congress. There is a prolonged deadlock in Parliament. The ruling and opposition parties are in a face-off over a parliamentary panel to probe Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The minister is accused of involvement in multiple cooperative frauds. The House obstruction by the main opposition over the demand first made in the winter session has continued even after the commencement of the budget session on May 10. If our political parties cannot even come together to pass the national budget, it would be hard for foreigners to trust us with their money. The only way Nepal will attract quality investment and make a leap in its development endeavour is through a collective political effort to ensure policy consistency. For the country’s larger good, they must also be able to see beyond their partisan interests.  \nAs the midsummer mercury rises, storing fresh food remains a challenge. In a country where the usage of refrigerators remains limited to urban areas, there is a risk of food getting contaminated. Moreover, our general attitude towards food safety and preservation, especially in eateries, is casual. For instance, we see meat shops openly displaying raw meat items all day on tables and showcases, without the use of freezers. Sweet shops and restaurants are no better, as they are tempted to display their food items to attract customers. Even though the food might look appealing to our eyes when it is served in eateries, it is ultimately harmful to our health as many do not follow the proper food safety protocols. The open display of food items invites bacteria and dust contamination, apart from the obvious heat-related hazards, leading to the onslaught of various diseases, including cholera and food poisoning, apart from a lack of nutrition. Although Nepal has food safety regulations in place, the lack of implementation and monitoring continues to pose the risk of food-borne diseases to the public. The Food Act, 2023 (1967) prohibits the production, sale or distribution of adulterated foodstuff or sub-standard foodstuff. By adulterated foodstuff, the Act means \"foodstuffs rotten so as to be harmful to health, or prepared or kept in a filthy or toxic condition\". In January last year, Nepal implemented a new set of food safety regulations, which has provisions for the careful production, processing, packaging, handling, storage and supply purity of food. The regulations also have provisions for labelling the food, including its nutritional value.However, apart from poor implementation of such regulations, the monitoring of the regulations is almost non-existent. In rare instances when food inspectors from municipalities bother to monitor the food in eateries, there is a high chance of such eateries being found flouting the regulations. For instance, in Kathmandu, as in most parts of the country, food items, especially items like meat that get contaminated quickly, are laid out in the open and sold. This causes great health risks, but the authorities of all levels of government seem either oblivious to or uninterested in the issue. In Kathmandu Metropolitan City, for instance, the authorities' focus is on removing the food vendors altogether, guided by a flawed notion of gentrification rather than regulating them under tax and food safety regimes. In other parts of the country, hardly anyone bothers to check the quality of food provided to customers.The state cannot remain a mute spectator when the health of the citizens is put at risk due to the carelessness of vendors. Rather, the state should strictly maintain food safety standards regularly—not in an episodic pattern, such as during festivals or at the whims of authorities but as a standard practice. Some basic steps include making it mandatory for vendors to keep appropriate food items in freezers, use covering, and segregate food items to avoid cross-contamination. As the culture of eating out is becoming increasingly common, especially among young people, the state should actively enforce food preservation and safety regulations to keep the citizens healthy. \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   \nThe budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nFire incidents have surged in Nepal, with over 3,000 incidents in 2023, fueled by inadequate rainfall, high temperatures, wind gusts, and increased stubble burning, leading to the loss of lives, the destruction of settlements, and ecosystem damage, highlighting the need for increased training, equipment, and awareness campaigns to mitigate the situation.\nNepal hosts third Investment Summit to attract Foreign Direct Investment, aiming to learn from previous shortcomings and improve investment-friendly policies.\nPolitical parties' power struggles in forming provincial governments, coupled with leaders blaming the mixed electoral system for instability, have led to a rise in public frustration with the provinces.\nJung Bahadur's 1854 Muluki Ain codified laws, replacing arbitrary rulings, established institutions with defined powers, and recognized the rule of law while acknowledging the caste system and addressing its injustices.\nSinohydro denies non-payment of promised taxes to Helambu for construction materials, citing legal sourcing and recycling of discarded materials.\nDespite Japan's labor shortages and memorandum with Nepal, Nepali workers face challenges in finding SSW positions in Japan due to misunderstandings, including the misconception of government involvement and the exclusion of third-party agencies.\nMichael Hutt acknowledges Deepak Thapa's concerns about Nepali studies in Euro-America, particularly at SOAS, where Krishna Pradhan's retirement in 2019 has led to the discontinuation of Nepali courses, jeopardizing future studies in the UK.\nDespite illegality, Chhaupadi, a menstrual taboo practice in Nepal, persists, requiring stronger punishment, societal condemnation, and reporting of unrevealed cases.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe parliamentary meeting on Thursday that was expected to end the ongoing impasse ended up in a scuffle between the ruling and opposition lawmakers.The House meeting called for 11 in the morning was postponed until 4 pm in an attempt to find a meeting point among the parties over the formation of a parliamentary panel to probe Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s embezzlement of cooperatives funds. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal himself had held meetings with ruling parties and also the main opposition Nepali Congress to find a way out. However, the ruling parties and the Congress couldn’t agree on terms of reference of the parliamentary probe committee.The ruling parties agreed to constitute the parliamentary panel to investigate the embezzlement of savings in the cooperatives and recommend action against the individuals, institutions and companies benefited illegally. However, the Congress wanted the probe focused on Rabi Lamichhane, erstwhile managing director at the Gorkha Media Network, and others who illegally benefited from Supreme, Suryadarshan, and Swarnalaxmi, among other cooperatives. The ruling parties, particularly Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), did not agree to the proposal to focus only on the cooperatives where Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane is allegedly involved. “Our demand is to constitute a parliamentary committee to investigate the problems facing the cooperative sector, including Rabi Lamichhane’s involvement in the alleged fraud. The ruling alliance is not ready for it. It wants a panel that will broadly investigate the problems in the sector without addressing our concerns. The alliance is trying to divert attention from the main issue,” said Prakash Sharan Mahat, the Nepali Congress spokesperson explaining why there could be no agreement.The ruling parties, however, say the Congress, guided by a mala fide intent, has been insisting on an investigation committee focusing on three or four cooperatives. “We had just demands: first, our chairperson must be allowed to clarify on the allegations in Parliament. Second, as problems have been seen in several cooperatives, there must be a broader investigation,” said Manish Jha, an RSP lawmaker. “Why just focus on three or four cooperatives? Why not probe the cooperatives that are led by Congress leaders?”The meeting of the House of Representatives postponed for 4 pm was held two hours later. No sooner had the meeting commenced, the Congress started chanting slogans. Amid the obstruction, Speaker Devraj Ghimire read out the letters from the President’s Office regarding the authentication of a bill and addition of ministers from the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party. The situation got tense when Ghimire asked Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and address the meeting amid the protest of the main opposition.The Congress lawmakers had already gathered at the well and were raising slogans demanding a parliamentary probe into Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling funds of several credit cooperatives.After the Speaker allowed the minister to go to the rostrum, the Congress lawmakers and senior CPN-UML leaders, who were on the front row of the ruling bench, engaged in heated verbal exchanges. The situation escalated after UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress vice president Dhanraj Gurung engaged in an intense argument. Other lawmakers from the two sides subsequently joined the resulting scuffle. Even Prime Minister Dahal and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Rekha Sharma engaged in an argument with the Congress lawmakers.Both sides have pointed fingers at each other for the tensions. “The situation escalated after the Congress lawmakers tried to stand in front of the rows designated for the ruling parties in order to prevent Home Minister Lamichhane from heading to the rostrum,” said Sharma. “The Congress is responsible for the unparliamentary behaviour.” The UML has demanded an apology from the Congress, claiming its lawmakers misbehaved with Oli.The Congress, however, said the Speaker’s irresponsible move [of inviting the home minister to the rostrum] was responsible for the unpleasant incident in the House. “The Speaker is guided by partisan interests. It was wrong of him to invite the home minister to address the House when the opposition was obstructing the House,” said Mahat. The next House meeting has been called for 11 am Friday.Earlier, the meeting of the National Assembly was also adjourned until 1:15 pm on Friday following obstruction from the Nepali Congress.The main opposition has been obstructing the budget session of Parliament since the first day of the session that commenced on May 10. However, the opposition parties had allowed the President to table the government’s policies and programmes. The RSP has said they will not agree to any probe panel targeting its chairperson. “The probe panel will be formed only if there is an agreement to investigate the Congress President [Sher Bahadur Deuba] and his son,” said Jha. “To challenge our party, those who have been in power for decades need to come clean.” \nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has questioned the constitutional role and the impartiality of Speaker Devraj Ghimire following a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives.After Thursday’s incident, relations between the ruling CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the main opposition, Nepali Congress, could get more sour.“The Speaker should take the main responsibility for today’s incident,” Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said during a news conference after the scuffle between the opposition and ruling lawmakers. “The Speaker was following a leader’s order.” Thapa hinted that the Speaker was guided by the ruling CPN-UML. Ghimire was elected to the House from Jhapa on a UML ticket. Though a lawmaker formally disassociates him/herself from the party, their independence in running the House is often questioned.“Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened today in the House is unfortunate and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.”He also hinted that UML chairman KP Sharma Oli had instigated Thursday’s tensions. While speaking at a function on Wednesday, Oli had stated that Thursday’s Parliament meeting would proceed despite obstruction by the Nepali Congress. “Today we saw that happen,” said Thapa. “This means the Speaker was taking orders from the leader [Oli].”Thapa claimed that when his party’s vice-president, Dhanraj Gurung, was chanting slogans demanding a parliamentary probe, Oli approached and provoked him. Then the scuffle ensued, said Thapa.Thapa also declared that the Congress will not sit for talks with anyone until a parliamentary committee is formed. Some Congress leaders were earlier in talks with their Rastriya Swatantra Party counterparts and had exchanged terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary committee, but there was no further development due to their differences. Leaders said that Thursday’s scuffle has added to the uncertainty of the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the cooperatives scam and Lamichhane’s alleged involvement.“We were about to agree on the terms of reference [ToR] of the proposed parliamentary committee with the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” said a Nepali Congress office bearer. “But there was a disagreement after the RSP refused to include the home minister’s name in the draft.”The ToR proposed by the Congress explicitly called for probing the role of the home minister in the cooperatives scam. But the RSP has been insisting on a probe into the entire cooperatives sector and not Lamichhane.   \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nFor decades, cross-border trade between Nepal and India was traditionally done due to social ties spanning borders. The situation now is different. It’s now an organised commercial informal trade happening at a large scale, according to a research finding. Rice appears to be a key commodity ‘highly informally’ imported from India to Nepal. The research, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, shows that only 40 percent of rice is imported to Nepal from India through a formal channel.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, leading to a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports. In the current fiscal year, the government also introduced a 13 percent VAT on some vegetables, including onions and potatoes.With this variation, the price differences between Nepal and India become 18-20 percent, or rice in India becomes cheaper by at least 18 percent.The paper said that India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west. According to a separate report by the International Food Policy Research Institute, carrying or informally transferring goods has become a full-time profession for many poor families living close to the towns along the Nepal-India border.“Carriers,” many of them women, collect the goods on the Indian side and bring them in via the open border, escaping the formal customs entry points, sometimes on foot, sometimes on bicycles and motorbikes, and always at their own risk.Presenting the report titled ‘Insights into Informal Cross-Border Trade in Agri-Food Commodities in South Asia’, Dikshya Singh, programme coordinator at SAWTEE, a South Asian think tank based in Kathmandu, said the export duty imposed by India on rice in September 2022 followed by an export ban on non-basmati rice in July 2023, fueled the informal trade.The report said that rice, vegetables, chemical fertilisers, and seeds are other agricultural products and inputs that have been largely coming through informal channels.The study reveals that this informal trade is dominated by a small group of traders forming an oligopoly. Moreover, the study indicates that large-scale informal trade is controlled by mafia-style syndicates with political backing.Anand Bagaria, managing director of Nimbus Holdings, said Nepal needs proactive measures to deal with informal cross-border trade. “Since we cannot influence our neighbouring countries’ policies, Nepal needs to be clear about what could be the right balance between inflation, government revenue, and mitigating quality-related risks while dealing with informal trade.”Singh said Nepal heavily relies on informal trade to meet its need for agricultural inputs.The report attributes the illegal import of chemical fertiliser to the persistent shortage in Nepal and cheaper rates in India.The report showed that Nepal needs 800,000 tonnes of chemical fertiliser annually. The country has been able to import 400,000 tonnes formally, and an estimated 200,000 tonnes come through informal channels. According to the report, farmers in Nepal have been informally importing a variety of seeds that are not available locally, especially hybrid seeds of vegetables, mainly due to import restrictions and to avoid non-tariff requirements.SAWTEE conducted surveys at nine customs points, including Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Biratnagar, Nepalgunj, Kakarbhitta, Krishnanagar, Jaleshwar, Suthauli, Maheshpur, and Bhadrapur and the border crossings in their periphery.“The informal trade between Nepal and India is as big as formal trade,” said Paras Kharel, executive director of SAWTEE. Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary, said that gold and silver, areca (palm) nuts, onion and garlic, poppy seed, edible oil, and black pepper are informally exported to India from Nepal. “Informal trade is rising between Nepal and India because of the price differences caused mainly due tariff advantage and tariff differences and non-tariff barriers for formal export.”“The misdeclaration of exported goods from Nepal to India needs to be addressed,” he said. For instance, Nepal exports cabbage to India from Koshi province. As India has restricted the import of other types of vegetables from Nepal, traders are exporting other vegetables like okra, chayote, and chilli under the name of cabbage, Ojha said.Article 2 of the trade treaty between Nepal and India, and the agreement on cooperation to control unauthorised trade talks about controlling informal trade. “During the bilateral discussion, be it commerce level, inter-government committee meetings, or customs director-level meetings, either annually or bi-annually, they discuss informal trade. But there hasn’t been any serious discussion about controlling informal trade,” Ojha said.Nepal raised issues like the informal import of agricultural goods from India to Nepal, while the Indian side brought up issues like the informal import of goods including areca nuts, edible oil, poppy seeds, and black pepper, but no concrete solution has been found yet, according to Ojha. Sabnam Shivakoti, joint secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, pointed out that cross-border trade that was done traditionally due to social ties across borders is not the same as the organised commercial informal trade that is happening now on a large scale. “This has been affecting agricultural and industrial sectors as they have to compete with cheap imports.”According to Shivakoti, an import restriction on dairy products was announced in February 2024 to protect domestic farmers and the dairy industry, but that led to formal imports being diverted to informal channels.Trade experts said that as the Indian government is providing eight types of subsidies on agricultural products, as a result, Nepali products become less competitive even in the domestic market, raising the informal trade to Nepal. \nDefending champions Armed Police Force Club wrapped up their group stage with a perfect record as they defeated Sudurpaschim Province by three wickets in the Lalitpur Mayor Women’s T20 Championship at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Thursday.APF had already secured their spot in the final on Wednesday after registering their third consecutive victory in as many matches.Thursday’s victory also ensured APF top spot in the five-team standing.APF will now look to win a record extending fourth title in the title match on Saturday.Electing to field first after winning the toss, APF restricted Sudurpaschim to 111-5 in the allotted 20 overs.Sudurpaschim captain Bindu Rawal top scored for the team with 36 runs off 51 balls. Bindu and opener Rubi Poddar put on a 57-run stand for the second wicket.After Poddar returned to the pavilion making 29 runs off 36 balls, Bindu added 37 runs with Kabita Joshi, who played 29 not out off 28 balls, to guide Sudurpaschim to a fighting total.Manisha Bohara, Samjhana Khadka, Ritu Kanoujiya could not score in double digits.Rekha Rawal and national team captain Indu Barma took one wicket each for APF.In reply, APF made a shaky start to their chase, losing Rajmati Airee (11), Barma (4) and Sita Rana Magar (5) cheaply.Roma Thapa departed next scoring 23 runs off 20 balls, leaving APF in deep trouble at 50-4 in the eighth over.But Mamta Chaudhary played an unbeaten 32-ball knock and Sarita Magar added 19 runs off 30 balls to lead the departmental side to 112-7 in 19.4 overs.Laxmi Saud picked two wickets for Sudurpaschim. Janaki Thapa, Joshi, Kanoujiya, Sneha Mahara and Bindu pocketed one wicket apiece.In the day’s other action, Koshi Province defeated Lalitpur Mayor’s XI by six wickets to register their first win of the tournament. Apsari Begam took 3-25 and Alisha Khadiya returned the figures to 2-9 to help Koshi restrict Mayor’s XI to a low total of 88-9.Ashma Pulami Magar top scored for Mayor’s XI. She was unbeaten on 26 not out. Kiran Kunwar provided the second highest score with 13 runs.In reply, Kajal Shrestha and Tika Shah played a 56-run stand for the second wicket to guide Koshi to victory.Shrestha scored 36 runs off 45 balls, while Shah made 25 off 34 balls.On Friday, Sudurpaschim will face Bagmati Province in the last group fixture.The final will take place on Saturday.  \nA team of high-altitude sherpa guides recovered the body of a Mongolian climber from Mt Everest after four days, the first casualty of this spring climbing season.The search and rescue team found the body at the point of 8,600 metres, hooked in the fixed ropes of Everest, the expedition organiser said. Details of his death were unclear.The two Mongolians—Tsedendamba Usukhjargal, 31, and Lkhagvajav Purevsuren, 53, have been reported missing since Monday.“The rescue team spotted another body at 8,400 metres, a bit far from the fixed ropes,” said Pemba Sherpa of the 8K Expedition company that provided support services to the Mongolians up to their base camp. “They [the rescue team] were not sure whether it was the body of another Mongolian. They have taken a photo and descended to the base camp to verify it,” he said. “It will be verified by Saturday.”Pemba Sherpa, however, said that they have been discussing with the families whether to retrieve the body from the death zone, above 8,000 meters where oxygen is thin.. “It requires a huge amount of money—at least $70,000 to bring the bodies back.” “We have to mobilise at least 10 sherpas to bring the bodies from one of the dangerous points of the earth. From the lower reaches, the bodies should be airlifted by helicopter.”According to the new rule of Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, in case of the death of a mountaineer, the guides, the trekking and travel agencies concerned shall be responsible for managing the body.On April 4, the Mongolian National News Agency reported that Mongolian mountaineers D Otgonkhuu, TS Usukhjargal and L Purevsuren would depart on April 5, 2024, to climb Everest, the world’s highest peak.“This time, it will be special as they will climb for the first time among the Mongolian mountaineers, not using any additional oxygen and without a guide. The three Mongolian mountaineers plan to conquer 8848.86 metres high Mount Everest by June 1, 2024,” according to the new agency report. \"They are the members of the Hunnu hiking club who decided to carry all the luggage themselves from the base camp and do the camping themselves.”Of the three members, two set off last weekend from their final camp at 8,000 metres for the summit. They were last spotted by another climbing group at Camp IV, the final camp, on May 13 at 8:45 am. Since then, they lost contact with the Everest base camp officials.Bad weather and high winds hampered any search for the missing climbers in the death zone.Everest is the world’s tallest summit at 8,848.86 metres, and according to the Department of Tourism, there have been more than 8,300 summit ascents from the Nepal side since the mountain was first scaled by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953.World record holder Kami Rita Sherpa reached the top of Mt Everest for the 29th time on Sunday, breaking his own record for the most summits of the world’s highest mountain. \nNineteen-year-old Amit, who’s currently in his gap year, started vaping two years ago. He says he isn’t addicted to it—he barely experienced any withdrawal syndrome when he quit it last year, before picking it up again. Amit, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym to protect his privacy, says he vapes just because he wants to.Unlike Amit, Rita (name changed), who is 21, switched to vaping after smoking tobacco for a while. Rita says that since she hopes to quit smoking altogether, she doesn’t mind the Nepal government’s intention to put a blanket ban on e-cigarettes. But doctors say a ban may lead those who smoke vape to switch to smoking tobacco again.As debates continue around the world about the pros and cons of vaping compared to smoking tobacco, the Nepal government earlier this month announced that it was banning e-cigarettes. The National Health Education, Information, and Communication Center (NHEICC), under the Department of Health Services, says it is seeking help from other ministries to enforce the ban. While some vape users the Post talked to said that the ban would help them quit smoking altogether, there are other aspects of the ban that need a more careful consideration for youths’ health, experts say.Meanwhile, some other users said banning vapes makes little sense as tobacco cigarettes are still freely available in the market for people of all age groups. If the government is so concerned about youths’ health, they question, shouldn’t stricter measures be taken to ensure that minors, for instance, don’t purchase cigarettes?Nepal is not the only country to ban e-cigarettes of late. Most recently, the British prime minister announced a ban on all disposable cigarettes, citing risks to youth health following a significant rise in vaping.There are 33 countries that have altogether banned the sale of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), while according to a WHO report published in early 2024, around 74 countries have no regulations on the sale of e-cigarettes.Most countries in the world have a legal age to purchase traditional cigarettes, according to the WHO, while 88 countries have no minimum age limit to buy e-cigarettes.Moreover, the WHO has repeatedly urged countries around the globe to reduce the spread of e-cigarettes. A call to action was published in December last year, urging governments to strengthen regulations on e-cigarettes.Nepal, meanwhile, has no regulations on e-cigarettes. While they haven’t banned e-cigarettes outright, countries like China have imposed a number of regulations, including licensing to sell the products publicly, ban on flavoured products, and imposition of taxes.In a study on the prevalence of e-cigarette usage among undergraduate students in Kathmandu, 21.2 percent respondents said they never used e-cigarettes, while five percent said they currently used cigarettes. An estimation of global e-cigarette use put the number of its users at 82 million worldwide, 14.2 million of them in South Asia.Most countries cite e-cigarettes as a contributor to youth smoking.Nepalis do not need to produce an ID to purchase either tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Amit, for instance, was still a minor when he started vaping. That these harmful products are freely available to people of all age groups goes against the Tobacco Products (Control and Regulatory) Act, 2068 (2011), which says that it is illegal to sell tobacco products to those below the age of 18.“A stricter control on the sale of tobacco products is essential to curb smoking among youths,” says Dr Bhakta Bahadur KC, chief of Health Promotion and Tobacco Control at NHEICC. KC adds that to prevent minors and pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to the risks of smoking, from purchasing cigarettes, local governments should introduce provisions on licensing. “This is one way to control smoking in vulnerable groups,” says KC.Moreover, banning e-cigarettes fully may not be possible as they are widely sold through social media and smuggled products might still be available for purchase online. The NHEICC is currently calling on other ministries, including the Ministry of Information and Technology, and the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, to help it ban e-cigarettes as they are imported from foreign markets.“Right now, the NHEICC is focused on banning e-cigarettes as a whole due to its adverse effects on the health of young adults, and its role as a gateway to tobacco smoking,” KC says.But Dr Augraj Uprety, Doctor of Medicine at the BPKIHS Department of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine in Dharan, provides a different perspective. With the ban on vapes, youths may find themselves attracted to tobacco smoking, as a significant number of vape users, like Rita, turn to e-cigarettes, supposedly to protect themselves from the harmful impacts of tobacco cigarettes.“Banning e-cigarette is not a cure-all,” Uprety says. “It is also vital to focus on handling the nicotine-dependence syndrome which both tobacco and e-cigarette users experience.”Both tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly addictive chemical, but tobacco cigarettes contain higher amounts of toxic chemicals than e-cigarettes. But studies show that e-cigarettes are especially harmful for youths as they affect adolescent brain development due to exposure to nicotine, and the aerosol in e-cigarettes has known effects on lungs.Further, there is little knowledge about the long-term impacts of e-cigarettes as it’s a relatively new technology.“I will never say banning e-cigarettes is a bad thing. It is an important move,” Uprety says. “But we also need to conduct a pilot study to figure out the repercussions of a potential ban.” \nSudurpaschim set up APF finalBindu Rawal’s team defeat Bagmati Province by 109 runs in the last group fixture in Kirtipur to advance into the final as group runners-up.SPORTS BUREAUKATHMANDU, May 17Sudurpaschim Province progressed into the final of the Lalitpur Mayor Women’s T20 Championship defeating Bagmati Province by a massive 109 runs at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Friday.Sudurpaschim’s opponents in the Saturday’s title match will be defending champions Armed Police Force Club, who are the most successful side of the tournament having won all of previous three editions.APF, who are bidding to a record-extending fourth Lalitpur Mayor T20 crown, are the only side to have maintained a perfect run in the tournament. They progressed into the final as group winners after accumulating eight points from four matches.Sudurpaschim became group runners-up with six points.Samjhana Khadka scored an unbeaten half-century—her second fifty of the tournament—while Rubi Poddar, skipper Bindu Rawal and Kabita Joshi were also impressive with the bat.Openers Poddar and Khadka gave Sudurpaschim a strong start scoring 60 runs for the first wicket, before Poddar departed in the ninth over making 28 runs off 36 balls.Khadka then put on a 43-run stand with captain Rawal for the second wicket to put Sudurpaschim in the driving seat.After Rawal departed for 28 for 23 in the 15th over, caught by Krishma Gurung, Khadka completed her fifty off 35 balls and added another 54 with Kabita Joshi for the third wicket to post a big 157-2 from 20 overs.Khadka ended her innings unconquered on 74. Her 47-ball knock featured 10 hits to the fences.Joshi was not out on 20 runs.In the chase, Bagmati were all out for just 48 runs in 16.1 overs, thanks to a lethal bowling from Ritu Kanoujiya who took 3-5 in her magical four over spell that also included one maiden over.Joshi and Laxmi Saud were also outstanding with the figures of 2-16 and 2-5. Except Gurung (16), none other Bagmati batters could score in double digits.Rawal and Karishma Thapa also took one wicket apiece for Sudurpaschim.The tournament features five teams, including Mayor XI along with four teams reaching the playoff round of the 2023-24 Prime Minister Cup Women’s T20 National Cricket Tournament.APF, Koshi Province, Sudurpaschim and Bagmati entered the Lalitpur Mayor T20 as teams reaching the PM Cup playoffs. APF won the tournament that was held from December 21, 2023 to January 3, 2024.Mayor’s XI consists of players from the remaining four teams—Madhesh Province, Lumbini Province, Gandaki Province and Karnali Province—who failed to qualify for the Prime Minister Cup semi-finals. \nA 1.43-km-long tunnel breakthrough on the Kathmandu-Tarai expressway was achieved on Friday.The final point of one of a ‘twin tube tunnel’ at Lendanda has been completed and preparations for the completion of the other one are underway, said Brigadier General Gaurav Kumar KC, also the spokesperson for the Nepal Army.Of the 1.63-km-long tunnel at Dhedre tunnel site, 1.506 kilometres have been cleared and only 124 metres remain, KC added.Likewise, only 1.197 kilometres of the Mahadevtar tunnel, the longest in the project, is left to be cleared of the total 3.355 kilometres.The Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway, or fast track, connects the capital city and Nijagadh in southern Nepal with a 76-km highway. Once completed, it will cut the current travel time by several hours. With 11 km in bridges and 6 km in tunnels, the expressway is more complex than any road construction project Nepal has undertaken before. The Nepal government on May 4, 2o17 formally handed over the project, under the Department of Roads, to the Nepal Army. The national force started building the multi-billion-rupee project in August of the same year with a four-year completion target.However, in December of 2023, Nepal Army Chief Prabhu Ram Sharma, presenting a bleak picture of progress at a parliamentary committee meeting, said that the highway might not be ready even three and a half years from then.The project has been split into 13 packages, with the army yet to award contracts for the 6.5 km area at the Khokana-Bungamati area in Lalitpur, Makwanpur and Nijgadh, due to land acquisition at the entry point yet to be completed.So far, the expressway has made an overall progress of 33.99 percent. \nAs the midsummer heat threatens to bring a wave of the loo in the plains of Tarai-Madhes, all eyes are on the sky, expecting a spell of cloudbursts and rain. But once the monsoon enters in less than a month, we will be back to running for shelter. This year, Nepal, like much of South Asia, could experience above-normal monsoon rains, the result of La Niña, a condition associated with normal to above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall over much of South Asia. Technical experts at the 28 sessions of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum (SASCOF-28) held in the last week of April said the second half of the southwest monsoon season will likely develop La Niña. This will also mark the realisation of the fear of two extremes—of heat and rain—in South Asia this year.While we stand to make some windfall from the wet climate, especially in the agricultural sector, there is a huge cost attached to the onslaught of heavy monsoon rains—landslides and flooding. Each monsoon, we fear the worst disasters but make little preparation to deal with them. And if we do not prepare in advance, the bounty we expect from the monsoon will soon turn into bane. Last monsoon, Nepal witnessed 328 events of landslide, 166 events of heavy rain and 59 events of flooding, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). Ninety-six persons were killed in landslides, 19 in floods and eight in heavy rains. This means that our existing mechanisms of defence against destruction will probably not work. We might face similar or even bigger catastrophes this year, too, if we do not prepare well.But as of now, news reports about advanced preparation for disasters are hardly positive. If the unitary state of the past was inefficient in dealing with disasters, the federal state of Nepal has its own complications. While authorities at the NDRRMA complain of a lack of human and financial resources to deal with large-scale disasters, the local levels, which are the closest and the most accessible forms of the state to the people, have similar woes. The familiar problem of a lack of coordination between the three tiers of government stands to dampen our disaster preparedness and response actions.Another set of disasters that comes as part of the monsoon each year is water-related epidemics. Each monsoon enters with the risk of dengue, malaria, and cholera. And it is in these crucial times that our health care system does not function optimally, with health centres in several parts of the country failing to provide basic medicines and care. We cannot make lethargy a habit and wait for disasters. From daivi prakop (divine disasters) to prakritik prakop (natural disasters), we have made some advances in our understanding of disasters. It is now time to consider disasters manaviya prakop—the result of human actions—and intervene on time for risk reduction and long-term resilience. \nThe aspirations of multiple generations are tied to a nation’s development through experience, expertise, skill, new ideas and innovation. This lays the groundwork for a thriving society where each individual plays a vital role. For such a vision to come to fruition, it is essential to effectively utilise human resources. However, the question persists: How can a nation tap into the potential of its young workforce, ambitious achievers, learners, experienced retirees, migrant returnees and vulnerable populations primed for empowerment through education?Consider the management of police and military personnel on the verge of retirement, mainly those retiring in five years. In the past fiscal year, 5,961 police personnel chose voluntary retirement. One wonders what happens to their preparedness for combat and mindset regarding deployment after retirement and when retirement time approaches. The security mindset ingrained in police forces and militaries demands perpetual vigilance, rigorous training and an unwavering commitment to upholding public safety through proactive assessment and decisive action when required. There is a need to balance the seasoned and disciplined attributes they hone over the years.Comprehending the present challenges faced by students in Nepal is another aspect worth considering, as it can offer valuable perspectives on the employment scenario. Recent findings from the first-ever textbook audit report conducted by Education in Every Home, an organisation working on the education sector in Nepal, paint a stark picture: Only 75 percent children complete 8th grade, with a mere 27 percent advancing to 12th grade. How can the diverse youth receive the support they need from the government and society to enhance their thought processes and effectively utilise their potential when they don’t complete their education? Enhancing human resource management for those on the brink of retirement and promoting youth employment demands more than abstract notions. Practical steps are required to unite people of all ages. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and mentorship programmes is paramount. Moreover, it’s imperative to foster connections among eager learners, individuals seeking guidance and those who derive fulfilment from careers like police and military service. By valuing these professions and harnessing the spirit of youth, we can create a more dynamic and impactful community. Yet, beyond these efforts, we must explore innovative strategies to effectively manage human resources and combat unemployment. Tackling unemploymentThe unemployment problem can be tackled in two ways. First, the government can emulate the historical approach of Franklin D Roosevelt, who galvanised the “lost generation” to pioneer civilian conservation corps initiatives in forestry, flood control and infrastructure enhancements in the United States. As Homraj Acharya, a seasoned policy expert with extensive experience in US government and development projects in South Asia, contends, the Roosevelt approach left an indelible mark on the physical, psychological and employability facets of three million individuals enrolled in the programme. Their involvement in economic relief and conservation efforts offers a blueprint for modern initiatives tackling poverty and environmental concerns. Enrollees resided in camps, engaged in various projects and underwent rigorous training and education within the corps. This precedent offers a compelling model for addressing unemployment, poverty and environmental conservation.Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt’s visionary approach, Nepal could mobilise individuals nearing retirement age to establish a development brigade. This could enlist 50,000 individuals with approximately five years left until retirement, comprising 5,000 from the police force, 5,000 from the military and 40,000 from civilian sectors. The government can allocate additional funds to boost the salaries of police and military officers nearing retirement for joining the development brigade. These individuals can undertake infrastructure development, community enhancement, park innovation, river and lake clean up and conservation, road construction, solar panel installations, reforestation, herbs production and processing and unused productive land utilisation. This strategic initiative addresses unemployment and capitalises on valuable skills and expertise for national advancement. By offering meaningful employment opportunities in these sectors, Nepal can harness their skills and experience, reducing unemployment rates. This targeted approach would ensure continued workforce contribution and alleviate the financial burden on social welfare programmes, ultimately promoting more excellent economic stability and societal resilience.Second, to actively engage youth and students in meaningful work, introducing service learning—an educational approach—can inspire them to participate in community-based projects, nurturing awareness, empathy, critical thinking skills, leadership abilities, teamwork, cultural competence, communication skill and a sense of social responsibility. The mandatory service-learning project for high school students can be easily connected to the development brigade initiative, suggests Acharya. The programme, also known as community learning or experiential learning, can foster collaboration between universities, businesses, nonprofits and government entities, benefiting the local community. Through service-learning courses, students earn credits while undertaking hands-on experiences such as office work, fieldwork, journaling and reflection papers. They can expand professional networks, cultivate friendships, enhance well-being, build confidence, confirm career interests, and explore new fields of study. Introducing the concept of service learning, which can later evolve into the digital literacy brigade, can facilitate a smooth transition from acquiring practical skills to addressing unemployment for the youth and students of Nepal. As students engage in hands-on experiences during service-learning courses, they cultivate crucial skills for navigating the generational realm, enhancing employability and contributing to workforce readiness. This will ultimately benefit the country through a more skilled and capable workforce fostering economic improvement. Such initiatives provide practical solutions and promote a unified responsibility for societal progress. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and meaningful employment opportunities shall ensure that everyone, regardless of age or background, can meaningfully contribute to the nation’s advancement. By grasping the importance of intelligent human resource management and investing in the growth of citizens, Nepal can build a rock-solid base for a vibrant and challenging society. Here, every single member steps up to mould the shared future.Nepal is a development professional and co-founder of Education in Every Home. \nMore than two years after Russia invaded Ukraine, the West, remarkably, still lacks a unified strategy. Though it has supplied desperately needed weapons and ammunition, it has done little else to address Ukraine’s needs.What would an effective strategy look like? For starters, Western governments need to establish shared goals. Ukraine must expel Russian forces and recover all the territory that it has lost since 2014; Russia must be forced to pay war reparations to compensate Ukraine (the World Bank estimates that reconstruction will cost about $500 billion over the next decade); the thousands of Ukrainians who have been deported to Russia must be allowed to return; and the tens of thousands of suspected war crimes committed by Russian troops must be prosecuted and punished.The West can no longer get away with promising to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.” Rather than holding Ukraine back from attacking Russian strategic and military assets, it should welcome such strikes. Losing the war is the best thing that could happen to Russia. Historically, military defeats have usually led to reforms and a change in leadership – as happened after the Crimean War (1853-56), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), and the war in Afghanistan (1979-88). Vladimir Putin has re-introduced Stalinist-level repression and opted for eternal war, a project that is likely to end in his demise. While it is ultimately up to Russians to effect regime change, the West should welcome the prospect.Many believe that Russia has the advantage in a long war, simply because its population and economy are larger than Ukraine’s (though the United States was defeated in Vietnam and Afghanistan after long wars). Whatever the case, a longer war undoubtedly will cost everyone much more. As such, the West should return to former US Secretary of State Colin Powell’s Gulf War tactic of “shock and awe” to bring about a Ukrainian victory.That means delivering all the best conventional arms to Ukraine as soon as possible, rather than continuing the current drip-feed of old weapons. Nobody can put such weapons to better use than Ukraine’s skilful soldiers. If Ukraine were to lose, Russian forces would march further into Europe to fulfil Putin’s neo-Czarist ambition of restoring the Russian Empire. Since Ukraine’s people are fighting and dying to defend Europe, the least the West can do is give them all they need to win. Denmark and the Baltic states have set an example others should follow.Specifically, the West should furnish Ukraine with potent long-range weapons—such as ATACMS and Taurus missiles—as well as a strong air force, so that it can gain supremacy over the skies. With thousands of Westerners having volunteered to fight for Ukraine on the front lines, why shouldn’t Western pilots join, too? Ukraine needs proper air defense. Absurdly, the West has made Russia, rather than Ukraine, a no-fly zone.The eminent retired US Generals Ben Hodges and Philip Breedlove have long argued that Crimea is likely to be decisive. Similarly, in the mid-nineteenth century, Pavel Nakhimov, an admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy, observed that whoever controls Sevastopol (Crimea’s largest port) controls the Black Sea. Clearly, Ukrainian control of that city should be a major strategic goal. To cut Russia off from Crimea, Ukraine also will need to destroy the Kerch Strait bridges to the peninsula.To force Russia to pay war reparations to Ukraine, the West should confiscate the $300 billion of Russian central-bank reserves that it has frozen. Canada and the US have already adopted laws authorising such a move; they should follow through, and the European Union should follow suit. It is unconscionable that Russia can violate international laws with abandon and still have its property shielded in the West. As long as the war continues, the West will need to provide Ukraine with $100 billion per year—$50 billion at least in military assistance, $40 billion to finance the civilian government, and $10 billion in humanitarian assistance.While Western sanctions on Russia have had some bite, they must be strengthened. Owing to the existing sanctions, the Russian economy has not grown since 2014, and its export revenues fell by 26 percent last year. But to tighten sanctions further, all Western governments should impose prohibitive tariffs on all imports from Russia—as the EU is currently doing with respect to Russian agricultural goods. Western countries have already rescinded Russia’s most-favoured-nation status, and bounded tariffs permitted by the World Trade Organization are very high. Since Western countries trade so little with Russia, higher tariffs will no longer have any meaningful impact on their domestic inflation. And since the customs system functions well, enforcement problems would be minimised.During the Cold War, Western governments cooperated through the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom), headquartered in Paris. That body should be restored to ensure more effective control over sensitive exports to Russia. Personal sanctions also need to be coordinated, reinforced, and streamlined. All sanctioning jurisdictions should agree on similar rules, impose the same sanctions, and exchange classified information about the reasons for them.Meanwhile, Russians who condemn the war and withdraw from Russia should be delisted in all jurisdictions. Secret ownership in the West by sanctioned oligarchs should no longer be tolerated. Similarly, the West needs to start thinking about how to penalise Western companies that continue to work in Russia and support the Russian government with taxes and other benefits. One reasonable idea is that they be forced to pay penal taxes commensurate to what they pay to Russia.Finally, the EU should start accession negotiations with Ukraine, and NATO should use its 75th anniversary summit in Washington in July to extend a formal membership invitation to Ukraine. A large majority of NATO members already supported doing so at last year’s summit in Vilnius. There is no reason not to follow through this year as part of a broader unified Western strategy.-Project Syndicate \nThe three branches of the government function through a system of check and balance. When one of the executive, the legislative or the judicial branches exceeds its bounds, the others remind it of its constitutional limits. In the post-1990 democratic setup, the judiciary for one has by and large played a positive role in upholding democratic values that had repeatedly come under assault, particularly by the executives who refused to accept any limits on their powers. Yet of late some questionable verdicts of the top court in the country have raised the spectre of a ‘judicial supremacy’. On May 3, a division bench of the Supreme Court raised many eyebrows when it ruled that the Speaker of the Gandaki Provincial assembly should not be counted as an assembly member in the government formation process. So, in the 60-member assembly, even 30 members could constitute a majority. Back in March 2021, in a highly unanticipated decision, deciding what was essentially a petition challenging the party’s name, the court dissolved the ruling Nepal Communist Party. A couple of months later, the court even appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba the new prime minister. As there are disputes on government formation in nearly each of the seven provinces, the Supreme Court could time and again be asked to settle them, just like in Gandaki. That is not all. The decision on judging the legality of the recent split of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal also now rests with the top court. What we repeatedly see is that the court is being asked to rule on what are essentially political disputes. If there was even a minimum level of understanding among our major political actors, many of the disputes in the provinces could have been settled among themselves. In other words, it is our major political actors who are inviting judicial activism. This in turn undermines the credibility of the judiciary. Yet that is only one worry. If our political actors continue to turn to the courts to handle all major and minor political disputes, then we should not be surprised if the third branch of the state starts acting more and more arbitrarily. There is then also the risk of the courts being cooped by other power centres, as is the case, say, in our neighbouring Pakistan or Myanmar. In order to uphold its image as a neutral interpreter of the constitution and other laws, the judiciary could do its bit by declining to hear cases of certain nature that are best decided through political dialogue, or through healthy discussions in the sovereign parliament. Our political actors should also learn to act more maturely. Yes, the kind of electoral system the country has is unlikely to ensure a high level of political stability. Yet our politicians cannot get away by putting all the blame on the system. They too must learn to show at least a minimum level of political maturity. Again, the democratic system only works through check and balance. If one organ of the state forgets its duties, the whole system destabilises.   \nThe Nepal Army on Thursday said that it has collected nine tons of waste and recovered two bodies as part of its ‘mountain clean up campaign-2024’.The bodies have been handed over to the Forensic Lab of TU Teaching Hospital, Maharajgunj, the army said.The campaign, which began on April 11, aims to manage 10 tons of garbage and five bodies from Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse, the Nepal Army Directorate of Public Relations and Information had said in a statement. The collected degradable waste will be handed over to local units, while the non-degradable waste will be transferred to organisations specialising in recycling waste.The Nepali Army says it believes the campaign, which is carried out annually by the force, will play a significant role in minimising the impact of environmental pollution and climate change. \nFrench police shot dead an armed man who set fire to a synagogue in the northwestern city of Rouen early on Friday, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and local officials said.Police, who were called to the site because of smoke coming out of the building, shot the man when he threw an iron bar at them and threatened them with a knife as he left the synagogue, a Rouen city official said.The fire had been brought under control, the official said.The synagogue suffered significant damage, including to its furniture, but no one was harmed, Rouen mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol said, adding that the Normandy town was “battered and shocked”.“An armed man somehow climbed up the synagogue and threw an object, a sort of molotov cocktail, into the main praying room,” Mayer-Rossignol told reporters.The attacker’s identity and motive were still unclear.France, like many countries across Europe, has seen a huge spike in antisemitic acts since Hamas’ October 7 deadly attack on Israel and Israel's invasion of Gaza in response.“It’s once again an attempt to impose a climate of terror on the Jews of our country,” Yonathan Arfi, president of the CRIF Jewish advocacy group, said on X.France hosts the Olympic Summer Games in just over two months and recently raised its alert status to the highest level against a complex geopolitical backdrop in the Middle East and Europe’s eastern flank.The synagogue was surrounded by a series of security cameras, Mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol said.\"Tonight is Shabbat and it is important to light the candles to show that we're not afraid, that we continue to practice Judaism despite the circumstances,\" Rouen's Rabbi Chmouel Lubecki, told BFM TV. \nThe meeting of the House of Representatives, scheduled for Friday, has been postponed to Sunday.General Secretary of the parliament secretariat Padma Prasad Pandey issued a notice to notify the lawmakers about the deferral of the meeting.Earlier, Speaker Devraj Ghimire had delayed the lower house meeting called for 11 am to 2 pm citing a lack of preparation. Main opposition Nepali Congress had demanded that the proceedings be rescheduled to Sunday. Following a discussion between Ghimire and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the meeting was deferred with plans to put more effort to forge an agreement with the political parties before continuing with the proceedings.The next meeting has been scheduled for 11 am on May 19.Congress lawmakers have been obstructing the proceedings of both lower and upper houses demanding the formation of a parliamentary committee to probe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane in alleged embezzlement of cooperatives funds.On Thursday, the parliamentary meeting took an unexpected turn as ruling and opposition lawmakers engaged in a scuffle after the Speaker allowed Minister Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and address the meeting.The meeting of the National Assembly, held earlier in the day, was also adjourned until 1 pm Sunday after obstructions from lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress. \nTaiwanese lawmakers shoved, tackled and hit each other in parliament on Friday in a bitter dispute about reforms to the chamber, just days before President-elect Lai Ching-te takes office without a legislative majority.Even before votes started to be cast, some lawmakers screamed at and shoved each other outside the legislative chamber, before the action moved onto the floor of parliament itself.In chaotic scenes, lawmakers surged around the Speaker’s seat, some leaping over tables and pulling colleagues to the floor. Though calm soon returned, there were more scuffles in the afternoon.Lai, who is to be inaugurated on Monday, won January’s election, but his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lost its majority in parliament.The main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has more seats than the DPP but not enough to form a majority on its own, so it has been working with small Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) to promote their mutual ideas.The opposition wants to give parliament greater scrutiny powers over the government, including a controversial proposal to criminalise officials who are deemed to make false statements in parliament.The DPP says the KMT and TPP are improperly trying to force through the proposals without the customary consultation process in what the DPP calls “an unconstitutional abuse of power”.“Why are we opposed? We want to be able to have discussions, not for there to be only one voice in the country,” DPP lawmaker Wang Mei-hui, representing the southern city of Chiayi, told Reuters.Lawmakers from all three parties were involved in the altercations, and traded accusations about who was to blame.The KMT’s Jessica Chen, from the Taiwan-administered Kinmen islands that sit next to the Chinese coast, said the reforms were to enable better legislative oversight of the executive branch.“The DPP does not want this to be passed as they have always been used to monopolising power,” she told Reuters, wearing a military-style helmet.Taiwan is a rambunctious democracy and fighting does on occasion take place in parliament. In 2020, KMT lawmakers threw pig guts onto the chamber's floor in a dispute over easing US pork imports.The clashes raise the prospect of more turmoil - and parliamentary conflict - ahead for Lai’s new government after it takes office.“I am worried,” said the DPP’s Wang. \nWith new photographic and video evidence, an Indian court battle over the origins of the world famous butter chicken is set to get spicier.Two Indian restaurant chains have been sparring since January at the Delhi High Court, both claiming credit for inventing the dish in a lawsuit that has grabbed the attention of social media users, food critics, editorials and TV channels across the globe.The popular Moti Mahal restaurant chain said it had the sole right to be recognised as the inventor of the curry and demanded its rival, the Daryaganj chain, to stop claiming credit and pay $240,000 in damages. Moti Mahal said founder Kundan Lal Gujral created the cream-loaded dish in the 1930s at an eatery in Peshawar, now in Pakistan, before relocating to Delhi.That “story of invention of butter chicken does not ring true” and is aimed at misleading the court, Daryaganj said in a new, 642-page counter-filing reviewed by Reuters.Daryaganj says a late member of its founding family, Kundan Lal Jaggi, created the disputed dish when he helmed the kitchen at the relocated Delhi eatery, where Gujral, his friend-cum-partner from Peshawar only handled marketing.Both men are dead, Gujral in 1997 and Jaggi in 2018.Evidence in the non-public filing includes a black-and-white photograph from 1930s showing the two friends in Peshawar; a 1949 partnership agreement; Jaggi’s business card after relocating to Delhi and his 2017 video talking about the dish’s origin.By virtue of the friends’ partnership, “both parties can claim that their respective ancestors created the dishes,” Daryaganj says in the filing, calling the dispute a “business rivalry”.Moti Mahal declined to comment. The judge will next hear the case on May 29.A key point of contention, which the court will have to rule on, is where, when and by whom the dish was first made - by Gujral in Peshawar, Jaggi in New Delhi, or if both should be credited.Butter chicken is ranked 43rd in a list of world’s “best dishes” by TasteAtlas, and bragging rights about who invented it can matter, brand experts said.“Being an inventor has a huge advantage globally and in terms of consumer appeal.

Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nIn 2020, Nepal annexed disputed territory with India, reigniting tensions while political maneuvering and India-China relations play a role.\nNepal's 2022 Climate Change Survey reveals profound economic impacts on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, including economic losses of Rs415.44 billion in the last five years, water scarcity, new crop diseases, and biodiversity loss due to climate change.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nIn times of ongoing conflicts worldwide, Anay Ngawang Chodak, through his art, promotes the concept of ‘interconnectedness of existence’. He believes that by recognising our interconnectedness, we can work together toward positive change, promoting peace and harmony in a world that often feels divided.Chodak is a traditional Tibetan thangka master and contemporary artist. As a devoted Buddhist practitioner and direct descendant of the Repa Dorje Chang lineage—one of Jetsun Milarepa’s yogi disciples—he combines his rich heritage with modern artistic expressions.His solo art exhibition, ‘Opening Doors to Universal Inner Human Value’, is currently displayed at Kisimaaka Gallery in Thamel, Kathmandu. The exhibition, which started on April 6 and was initially planned to end on May 19, has been extended to May 23.In an interview with the Post’s Aarati Ray, Chodak shares insights on his art styles, the importance of ‘interconnectedness’ in today’s world and his new ‘wearable’ art collection.What styles of art do you create?I create various types of art, from Thangka and Tibetan to modern styles. My work combines Newa Paubha art, Kashmir’s Alchi art and Tibetan art, focusing on female energy as a divine source of wisdom.Can you tell us about your project with Kisimaaka Lines on wearable art?I’m collaborating with Kisimaaka Lines on a special project called the ‘Meditative Collection’. We design 100% cashmere shawls adorned with my Himalayan art. This project combines Himalayan beauty and elegance with colours, reminding us of universal human values of joy and harmony. By creating these wearable art collections, we aim to make Himalayan art more accessible and share the message of Himalayan culture globally.Your paintings often feature the theme of ‘Interconnectedness of Existence'. Can you explain this idea?In everything we do—what we eat, wear, think, and feel—there’s a theme of interconnectedness. We’re all connected and everything affects everything else. Good thoughts lead to good outcomes and bad thoughts lead to bad outcomes. Through my paintings, I want to emphasise this idea. Understanding our interconnectedness can help remind us that our actions impact others and that we share common human experiences and needs. This awareness can develop empathy, compassion and cooperation within us, reducing conflicts and helping to rebuild trust and unity. My art reminds us that we’re all connected and that practising kindness and compassion can bring us peace. In the digital and technology era, where people are becoming more isolated from each other, how important do you think staying connected is?Even in the digital world, I see interconnectedness. While there are negative influences, they still show how connected we all are, though in a less positive way. We need to spread positive messages more to harness the good side of interconnectedness.If we truly understand and practice interconnectedness, we can overcome jealousy, violence and negative feelings, leading to a world without conflict. We all feel pain, experience hunger and need water to survive. We must realise that at our core and soul, we’re not so different.Do you ever feel pressured to conform to traditional or modern art styles?I don’t feel pressured to conform to just one style. People often see traditional art as only depicting gods and deities, making it seem distant to the younger generation. However, I believe that Thangka art, traditional art and modern art all share the same essence.Contemporary art connects with our modern lifestyle and thoughts, while traditional art reflects human lifestyle and consciousness. On a deeper level, they’re all the same, so I use different approaches in my paintings to convey the same message.Traditional and contemporary art can communicate messages about good and bad deeds, showing their similarities. Therefore, I don't think we need to stick to or conform to just one style. How do you view ‘meditativeness’ in art?To me, meditativeness in art means cultivating good practices and habits. In a world of pessimism, it’s easy to fall into negative thoughts and behaviours. Practising meditative art involves propagating positive thinking and practices.With a free and boundless mind, there are no limitations. Barriers that once seemed insurmountable disappear, allowing us to see the world in a new light. Everything coexists without differentiation or separation in absolute freedom and unity. We should understand and appreciate the interconnectedness of all things and realise that we are part of a greater whole. What message are you trying to convey through the themes of female energy and divinity in your paintings?In the past, women and femininity were often looked down upon. However, both men and women have feminine and masculine qualities. We need to stop creating divisions based on these qualities. It’s high time we start celebrating femininity and women.Motherhood is the ultimate symbol of love. Even Buddha said that men and women are equal. For example, in my painting ‘Oneness’, I try to show a harmonious balance of masculine and feminine energies. When we move beyond our differences, we can appreciate and respect each other more deeply, allowing these energies to unite and flow beautifully.Just as a peacock uses poison to grow vibrant feathers, the snake skin on the female form in my painting represents transforming negativity into something positive. \nRishi Amatya is a writer, researcher, and heritage interpreter based in Mangal Bazaar. His works mainly comprise myth, history and culture. In addition to writing, he has written interactive and self-guided heritage maps for the Patan Museum and Hanuman Dhoka Museum. Radha: Wrath of the Maeju is his debut novel. In an interview with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Amatya discusses his first novel and why mythology is the focal point of his writing. How did you get into reading and writing?My mother was a primary school teacher and an avid reader, creating a home environment that encouraged reading. Our house was filled with a variety of books and magazines, such as Muna Patrika, Madhupark, and Yuwa Manch. Additionally, my friends and cousins had extensive collections of comic books, which further nurtured my reading habit.My writing journey began with my love for reading. After completing my SLC (now SEE), I started writing and took on various freelance writing jobs, including writing for websites. I wrote for a children’s magazine, ‘Young Harold’, covering different events. However, it wasn’t until 2006 that I began writing professionally. I contributed to Wave magazine, ECS and other publications, covering issues related to youth and culture.What is your first novel ‘Radha: Wrath of the Maeju’ about?The story centres on a girl named Radha, who once served as the Royal Kumari of Patan. As Kumari, she was confined to the Kumari Bahal, isolated from the outside world.After being dethroned, Radha longs to visit Mangal Bazaar and experience life as a normal girl. However, her world is shattered when an earthquake strikes, releasing demonic forces from another realm. These demons target Radha and her family. The book follows Radha’s struggle to do the right thing as she finds the courage to protect her family and the world she lives in.Do you follow any routines when you sit down to write? I try to write every day. When working on a piece, I aim to write 500-1000 words daily while drafting or writing a scene. I start writing whenever I have free time, striving to maintain consistency in my daily writing routine. Meeting deadlines demands extensive writing, so it’s essential to keep a steady writing schedule.How did you develop the characters of your novel? Are they purely fictional?All three main characters in my book are fictional, but they reflect people I’ve interacted with and dealt with in real life. Some of them are inspired by specific events in my life.Why did you choose to write on mythology?I aimed to create a story deeply rooted in our culture. Most fiction we read today is based on Western cultures, like Norse or Egyptian mythology.We often overlook Nepal’s rich and fantastic mythologies. We don’t revere our mythologies with the same reverence as Western ones. Additionally, there aren’t many literary works that interpret our society. I’ve always wondered what it would be like to set fiction in our Kathmandu Valley.To fill this gap, I crafted my book’s story to reflect our society’s current context, culture and our experiences as its people.What would you say to young writers?To excel in writing, it’s essential to keep reading and writing regularly. Exploring a wide range of books, both within and beyond your interests, can greatly enhance your writing skills.Reading books related to your field can significantly improve your writing process. Additionally, it’s important not to second-guess yourself or worry that your writing isn’t good enough. Self-censorship can hinder progress, so it’s crucial to write freely and confidently.What inspires you to write?I don’t have a specific individual as my source of motivation. Instead, I find inspiration in every author I’ve read. However, while working on my recent book, I was particularly inspired by the works of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novel series stands out as particularly satisfying. The series centres around a young protagonist and the evolution of this character is the most interesting part. Overall, I draw inspiration from the diverse range of authors I've read.What difficulties did you face while publishing the novel?One major hurdle I encountered while writing my book was the absence of editorial support. Fortunately, my publisher provided some editorial assistance. However, in general, securing editorial support remains a significant challenge for authors. Additionally, limited platforms are available for authors like myself to showcase our work.

On April 26, 2021, the Oli-led government allowed the use of the land exempting the ceiling for the deal. However, the constitutional bench, headed by Bishowambar Prasad Shrestha, ruled that Oli’s Cabinet decision contravened Section 12 (C) of the Land Act 1964 and was immature.The court also ruled against allowing the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding the legal ownership ceiling in any other place within Koshi Province, highlighting the legal implications of the land reforms.The requirement to first examine the specific land’s detailed area has been upheld by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench in the full text of the verdict. The land that is being considered for a swap ought to yield comparable value, read the court’s final verdict. But the tea estate is trying to swap its land in Birtamod, reportedly valued at Rs200 million per bigha, with low-price land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.While considering a swap, there must be a feasibility study to assess the new location’s production capacity. Technical experts’ advice ought to be followed in this context, reads the full text of the court.“It [the court verdict] has not just confirmed how wrong and corrupt the decisions and law amendments made by the government of the time were, but has also exposed policy-level corruption. There is no longer any doubt that such a decision is unfair and ill-intended. Therefore, further investigation is warranted,” Thapa wrote. When the Congress general secretary tried to bash the UML over the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate incident, UML chair Oli accused the Congress of selling 70 bighas of the estate in return for hefty commissions. Oli made the accusation while addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the UML on Wednesday. “The Congress should be careful when commenting on the UML on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate,” Oli said. “They once sold 51 bighas of land and later 19 bighas in the name of land swapping, just for commissions.”When the government in 2018 tried to swap the Giri Bandhu land, the court stopped it, saying there were no legal provisions to do so. “Abiding by the court’s ruling, we later formulated the law, but the court now has found the fault with it,” Oli said.The Congress has been cornering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane over his involvement in the co-operatives funds’ embezzlement. With this agenda the party also has been disrupting Parliament. But the ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being biassed against Lamichhane. And it is Oli and his CPN-UML party that has come to Lamichhane’s most resolute defence.The Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday decided to take up the issue of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in a serious manner.But Congress leaders deny that bringing up the tea estate issue is its calculated strategy to corner the ruling parties. “The parliamentary party meeting decided to take up this issue given the gravity of the matter. There is no ulterior motive,” Sanjay Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post. Meanwhile, Gautam also said the party will study Oli’s allegations against his party. When the Oli government amended laws related to land-swapping, Thapa of the Congress, who demanded an investigation into the Oli Cabinet’s decision, was a House member. Not only Thapa but most senior Congress leaders were members of Parliament at the time of the amendment.“Though one can question those involved in the law amendment on moral grounds, they cannot be held accountable on legal grounds,” Om Parkash Aryal, an advocate who was among those challenging the Oli government’s decision in the court, told the Post. “In such instances, it’s the government that makes such a decision which comes under the question.”King Mahendra’s implementation of land reforms in 2021 BS, through enacting the Land Act 2021 BS, was a momentous step. The law fixed the ceiling of land possession by individuals at 28 bighas in Tarai districts. The land exceeding the ceiling would be nationalised. Landlords close to the then royal palace were taken into confidence for the law’s implementation, and the palace made it clear that land used for industrial and agricultural purposes would not be nationalised.According to Section 12 of the Land Act 2021, land used for industrial, agricultural, cooperative farming, educational, or medical purposes is not put under the limit.Budhkaran Rajbanshi, a landlord in Jhapa considered close to the royal palace, was informed in prior that if he established a tea estate, the land beyond the ceiling would not be nationalised.To save his land, he founded the Budhkaran Tea Estate there. Three additional Jhapa landlords, the Giri brothers (Prem Kumar Giri, Krishna Kumar Giri, and Trilochan Giri) also received similar information. In Birtamod, Jhapa, the Giri brothers owned 500 bighas. Before the Land Reforms Act came into effect, the Giri brothers proceeded to register the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in order to safeguard the property. Land reform laws introduced later did not apply to the land as it had already been used for agricultural purposes. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel delivered the government's policies and programmes on Tuesday after the Nepali Congress lifted the obstruction in the House of Representatives. However, the disruption continued afterwards.President Paudel read out the policies and programmes of the government in the joint sitting of the federal parliament.The Congress then blocked the proceedings of both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly and did not let the assembly table a motion of expressing gratitude to the President for delivering the government’s annual paper.It is customary for Parliament to thank the President for reading out the annual policies and programmes. The parliamentary party meeting of the Congress on Tuesday morning, however, had decided not to allow Parliament to proceed after the head of state wraps up his presentation.The Congress later responded that the policies and programmes fail to address the problems of cooperatives’ victims. The main opposition has been protesting in Parliament, demanding a parliamentary probe into the issue of cooperatives around the country embezzling the deposits of hundreds of thousands of depositors. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane is the focus of the largest party’s fury for his alleged involvement in the cooperative scam. “Our position that the government has protected the people who have swindled cooperatives victims has been reconfirmed,” said Ramesh Lekhak, the chief whip of the Congress party, while talking to the media after the policies and programmes had been read out.The main opposition party was initially not ready to allow the smooth operation of the Parliament’s proceedings. The party even warned the government and the ruling partners that it would prevent President Paudel from presenting the government's policies and programmes should its demand go unheeded.The Congress has been disrupting Parliament, demanding a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane over allegations of cooperative funds embezzlement. Lamichhane has publicly refuted the charges and asked for a chance to make his case clear in Parliament.But the Congress has been preventing Lamichhane from speaking in the House. The Congress, which appeared tough against the resumption of parliamentary business, even the presidential appearance, had relented and agreed to let the President present the programmes. But it resorted to the obstruction soon after. In 2017, the CPN-UML, while in the opposition, had been obstructing parliamentary proceedings. It allowed then-President Bidya Devi Bhandari to present the annual policies. The opposition then protested the Cabinet’s decision to increase the number of local federal units in the Tarai in the midst of the elections. The party later obstructed the motion of thanks to the President.During Speaker Devraj Ghimire’s meeting with the party chief whips on Tuesday afternoon, before the President read out the government’s annual document, the Congress had announced its plan to continue to disrupt the House after the policies had been presented.“We will continue to interrupt the House until our demand is addressed,” Congress whip Sushila Thing told the Post. “As there is no parliamentary practice of barring the head of state to present policies and programmes, we too didn’t go that uncharted route.”The party will not allow other proceedings of the two houses for as long as it takes in order to get its demands addressed, Thing said.On Tuesday morning, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa and the party’s Chief Whip Lekhak met Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to discuss the issue of parliamentary obstruction. Dahal had requested the Congress leaders to allow a smooth functioning of the legislature. The Congress leaders also claimed that the prime minister seemed positive about addressing their demand.“While meeting our leaders, the prime minister seemed positive but he has not taken the necessary steps to honour the call of the main opposition,” Congress whip Thing said. Dahal’s openness to the formation of the probe committee was one of the reasons the Congress became ready to allow the President to present the policies and programmes. Shakti Basnet, the minister of energy, water resources and irrigation, claimed that the discussion between the government and Congress was headed in a positive direction.“Until late Monday night, the Congress was adamant on barring the President from presenting the policies and programmes. But on Tuesday, we reached an agreement to allow the President to do so,” Basnet, a Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, told the Post. “The government will similarly reach an agreement with the Congress on its demand for the probe committee.”According to the Congress leaders, Sunday's meeting between the prime minister and Congress leaders also concluded positively to address the party's demand. After the Congress leaders met Prime Minister Dahal, the party held the parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday morning. The same meeting allowed President Paudel to confer the government's annual policies and programmes. The ruling parties and the main opposition have been discussing smooth operation of Parliament for the past few days. However, given the inflexible positions of both sides, Tuesday’s session was expected to face trouble.“The ruling parties and the opposition need to come to a logical conclusion to open the parliamentary business,” UML whip Sunita Baral told the Post. “It looks like both sides only have discussed the issue at their ease. What we need is negotiation to resolve the issues of both Parliament and the cooperative scam.”The constitution mandates the government to present its annual budget on Jestha 15 (May 28 this year). For this reason also, the ruling and opposition parties need to close their ranks, Baral added.The ruling parties are ready to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the issues plaguing the cooperative sector. However, they are reluctant to constitute a committee with the mandate to probe Lamichhane. The Congress, too, is positive about a broad inquiry into the cooperatives, but it deems investigating Lamichhane in particular a necessity after various probes by police and other government bodies established his involvement in the scams. The Congress had disrupted the winter session of Parliament before it was prorogued on April 14, with the same demand. The party has also been obstructing the new session of Parliament that commenced on May 10. \nNepal’s regional political parties that emerged as prominent forces mainly after the political change of popular movement of 2006 have entered into a stage of disputes and divisions.On May 5, Ashok Rai, one of the top leaders of Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), along with some other key leaders, split the party and registered an application for a new party at the Election Commission. The election body registered the Janata Samajbadi Party under Rai’s leadership. Seven of the 12 federal lawmakers of the Yadav-led JSP-Nepal joined the Rai-led party.Yadav on Monday moved the Supreme Court challenging the Election Commission’s decision to register the new party, accusing the body of giving recognition to the Rai-led group as a new political party unconstitutionally. The case is sub-judice in the court.Yadav, who was deputy prime minister and minister for health and population in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government, resigned from his post on Monday. His party pulled out of the government.Later in the evening, Dahal appointed one minister and one minister of state from the newly formed party led by Rai.“With the resignation of our party’s ministers, our party has withdrawn its support to the government,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The JSP-Nepal’s parliamentary party leader Upendra Yadav, writing a letter to Speaker Devraj Ghimire, withdrew the party’s support to the government.On the other hand, the JSP-Nepal, which had been leading the Madhesh government since 2017, has been limited to a minority position after the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support to the provincial government. Yadav’s JSP-Nepal is the only party to get the opportunity to lead a provincial government continuously for seven years. With the UML and Maoist Centre withdrawing their support, it is almost certain to be out of power in the province for the first time in seven years.It is not only the JSP-Nepal that has split. In February, Rajendra Mahato, a key leader of the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), quit the organisation to announce his new campaign, Rastriya Mukti Andolan, literally the ‘National Liberation Movement.’Bijay Kumar Gachchhadar, who led the Madheshi Janaadhikar Forum-Democratic, merged his party with Nepali Congress. Once a powerful leader in national politics, Gachchhadar has now lost his influence in Madhesh as well.Hridayesh Tripathi, a prominent Madheshi leader, formed a separate outfit, the Janata Pragatisheel Party, over two years ago.A senior Maoist leader, Prabhu Sah from the Madhesh, also formed his own Aam Janata Party in December 2022.It is not only the traditional forces but also the emerging ones that are grappling with crises.The Nagarik Unmukti Party (NUP), which emerged mainly from the latest general election, has been embroiled in a factional dispute between party chair Ranjita Shrestha and her husband, Resham Lal Chaudhary. The rift caused the party to lose the opportunity to lead the Sudurpaschim provincial government last month.While Shrestha has joined hands with the Dahal-led ruling coalition, Chaudhary is lobbying to collaborate with Nepali Congress.The regional political forces, which had emerged as a serious challenge for mainstream political forces such as Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, have lost their influence drastically in the recent years, mainly due to intra-party feuds and divisions.“They try to agitate for their rights, but they also indulge in a politics of power, which contrasts with each other,” Tula Narayan Shah, a Madhesh-based political analyst, told the Post. “Probably one of their demands can be mustered through the protest, but the other can only be achieved from the House of Representatives.”Experts think that despite their shortcomings, regional parties’ relevance is still intact. “If the traditional regional parties could not prove their significance, they will be replaced by the new ones,” Lokraj Baral, a political analyst, told the Post. “However, the relevance of regional parties will remain intact.”He said that with the influence of Yadav diminishing in the province, CK Raut of Janamat Party is likely to take his position in the days to come if the latter can prove his credibility.Experts say that regional parties, rather than being driven to address the regional issues for which they were constituted, got diverted from their initial motives and became self-centered, culminating in splits.“When marginalised people constitute the party, those parties are often leader-centric,” Shah told the Post. “Parties where a single leader holds sway are less accommodative and more autocratic. Internal democracy is weak in those parties. As a result, they split.” \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n\nA man, who was injured while putting out a fire at Tapeshwar community forest in Godawari Municipality-4, Badikhel, succumbed to burn injuries on Tuesday.According to Senior Superintended of Police Shekhar Khanal of Lalitpur District Police Range, Shankar Pahari died while undergoing treatment at the Kirtipur-based Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre.Another injured, Ramesh Pahari, is being treated at the hospital.Meanwhile, a fire at Ananda forest in Godawari Municipality-6, Lele is yet to be brought under control. A total of 65 patients have been moved to a safer place after the fire spread to the premises of the Anandaban Hospital. \nNepal and Lithuania established diplomatic ties in February 2005. Nepal designated its Embassy in Copenhagen (Denmark) as a non-resident mission to Lithuania, and the Lithuanian Embassy in New Delhi represents Lithuania in Nepal. There have been minimal contacts and exchanges between the two countries. Trade, tourism and investment relations between the two countries are at a very low level. The Post caught up with Diana Mickeviciene, the ambassador of Lithuania to India, during her recent visit to Nepal to discuss Lithuania’s cutting-edge technology and its graduation to a developed economy, as well as bilateral economic, trade and tourism relations between the two small nations. Excerpts:Tell us about the bilateral economic and trade relations between Nepal and Lithuania.We are both small countries, far away from each other. But some trade is going both ways. For instance, we have exported medical cotton to Nepal in large quantities. And we have been buying tea and spices from Nepal. However, the trade amount is not very big. I think the biggest exchange we already have is the trade of services. Currently, there are some businesses that are trading services which are not reflected in the conventional trade balance. Our (Lithuania) economy is small but very innovative and digitalised. My country has gone far in more than 30 years of transformation. When we liberated ourselves from the Soviet Union, we were in shambles. Our economy was down completely, and people were very poor. But now we have graduated into a developed economy. We are considered a high-income country. So I think we've come a very long way. And what I see is Nepal is going a similar way. Nepal started slightly later, and the country is much bigger, with ten times Lithuania’s population. So challenges are, of course, more. And I think education is a big challenge. As we have done this transformation, we continue on digitalisation and on so many modernisation paths. This is the area we can help in advising and guiding because we just did it ourselves and we know how it works. I have been meeting a number of ministers to see which areas the Lithuanian expertise and experience could be best applied in the context of Nepal. So that's a new chapter that I want to open. You met Rekha Sharma, the minister for Communication, Information, and Technology. Can you share what issues were discussed?Since Lithuania ranks sixth in terms of cybersecurity globally, this is one area specifically where our expertise and knowledge could be very applicable, as Nepal has adopted a cybersecurity strategy and guidelines and is embarking on creating the National Cybersecurity Center. We have many companies which work in that area providing services to many others. For instance, the National Cybersecurity Center in Bhutan and the National Institution in Charge of Cybersecurity in Bangladesh were designed by a Lithuanian company. So we think that is what works well in this context. We would be happy to assist Nepal in the cybersecurity area. We could bring a group of experts to advise and guide Nepal. Exports and imports between Nepal and Lithuania have been declining. What should be done to boost bilateral trade between the two small nations for mutual benefit? The trade volumes are up and down and fluctuate year-on-year and this happens with many other countries. During Covid, we exported pharmaceutical agents for vaccines and the trade went up. But later, it declined because there was no need for it. So what we are trying to build now is high-tech cooperation which means the exchange of technology and services. This is one of the sectors which Nepal and Lithuania can exchange in future. We will never measure our relationship in conventional trade as the distance between the two countries is far. Also, nowadays, many producers who used to export have relocated to other regions and are producing in another country, thus changing the export origin, but the product remains Lithuanian. But of course, we need to work and check how our ICT sectors can work together. It's mostly private businesses. But as I said, as a very small but very dynamic government, we also have government-to-government proposals and solutions. So that's why I'm meeting in the ministry and trying to see the needs. We have a super strong laser industry. For decades, we have developed very good laser bays. The screens of an iPhone are cut by using a Lithuanian laser because we supply those laser cutting technologies to iPhone manufacturers—10 percent of the world's scientific lasers are from Lithuania. Our biometrics, which is part of a robotics system, companies have been working around the world and in South Asia helping to verify digital identities like those on voter lists or other registers. In India, the Aadhaar system has a tiny bit of Lithuanian technology used in it. So, we will always have a niche role, but whenever this expertise is needed, then we can really provide it.A small number of tourists visit Nepal from Lithuania. How can Nepal attract tourists from Lithuania?I have visited Nepal as a tourist twice, long ago and I think all of my friends have been to Nepal. We are a very small country and will always be small if you compare it to a much bigger country. Nevertheless, to attract tourists, there is a need to advertise a little more as I think Nepal has excellent things to offer for a reasonable price which is also very important. For now, I can see that almost every Lithuanian can afford a trip to Nepal. The Nepali embassy and travel agencies could also do a little more advertising. I, as a friend of Nepal, am very happy to say and testify to anyone who asks that it's a great country to visit. Be it cultural and religious tourism, mountain trekking, spa, or wellness, I think Nepal has everything. It's easy to reach because connectivity is really good. And it's easy to stay and enjoy as the country is not so super expensive, it's affordable. So what kinds of products are in demand in Nepal and Lithuania? I think from Lithuania it would be electronic devices, digital devices which are needed now in everyday manufacturing processes. For instance, in telematics, any production line with many vehicles or equipment must monitor how they all work. This is where Lithuania is again pioneering. We have 30 percent of India's market in the hardware of telematics. So a Lithuanian company is successfully working in India. It will be IT applications or IT-enabling hardware solutions that we are very good at. From Nepal I think lots of traditional exports could also be interesting as our way of thinking and understanding of fashion and interior is quite similar. For instance, we are a wooden culture. So for us, the idea of a cosy house is wood and textiles, which Nepal produces, which has an excellent market in Lithuania. But in the future, I think, with technologies, ecological farming products will be in demand as the population becomes aware of health and sustainability requirements and not just requirements but use for own consumption. So that's where anything that is ecological and sustainable gets traction, and that's a high-value thing already. It's not a simple potato or tomato, but it's made of ecologically grown products. So how can Nepal and Lithuania work together for mutual benefit? We are here to learn about the changes in Nepal, about the future needs, and about the areas where we are good. We are also here to exchange opinions on issues of global concern, like climate change, which has highly affected both Nepal and Lithuania. None of our countries are great polluters. We, too, are a very minor polluter, much below our obligations, in fact. So how small countries can be together to make sure that the world is really against further global warming is important. Further, I also stress to the Nepal government that we are very grateful for a very principled stance of Nepal vis-a-vis the Russian war against Ukraine. It's a war which is just next door, it's 500 kilometres from my home. Nepal, on a number of occasions, voted in the United Nations to say no to aggression. So I think we are also very grateful and appreciative. Also, we have this unique connection that I wanted to tell, which is a tiny, small, quaint language which was preserved in villages of our country as a very antique, ancient language that is very close to Sanskrit. Since Lithuanian is considered the closest living language, a sister language of Sanskrit. We have started this collaboration with academic institutions here, and Raghunath Adhikari from the Tribhuvan University defended his dissertation on the issue of linguistic similarities last year. And he is the first PhD in Asia to actually do this. So we are happy that we have this connection and he has become a friend of Lithuania. Through him we know about what is happening at the university. Tribhuvan University already has a Memorandum of Understanding with Vilnius University, which is our oldest and main university. So academic collaboration is also very important because there are people working also on technologies, and know-how, which ultimately lead to business cooperation.  \nA comprehensive guide for Pashmina export has been launched, aiming to facilitate small-scale businesses in Nepal. The trade facilitation guide to export Pashmina from Nepal was jointly unveiled by Myriam Ferran, deputy director general for International Partnerships of European Commission; Ambassador of the European Union to Nepal Veronique Lorenzo; Baburam Adhikari, joint-secretary at the Ministry of Industry; and Dhan Prasad Lamichhane, president of the Nepal Pashmina Industries Association, amid a function organised at the Nepal Pashmina Fibre Processing Facility in Lalitpur on Tuesday.The fibre processing facility, established with technical support from the EU-Nepal Trade and Investment Programme, was also inaugurated at the same event. The plant has been processing fibre collected from Chyangra farmers and supplying it to Pashmina producers.As part of the European Union’s broader support to strengthening the Pashmina value chain, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies developed the guide with technical support from the EU-Nepal Trade and Investment Programme implemented by the International Trade Centre.This guide is specifically tailored to enhance Nepal's Pashmina export endeavours in major international markets such as Japan, the European Union, the US, and the UK.The guide explains step-by-step processes, encompassing firm registration, licensing, directives, customs, shipment, and logistics procedures. Moreover, it offers insights into the import requirements specified by destination countries, shedding light on tariffs, quality standards, shipping costs, timeframes, and the essential documents needed, along with other crucial trade information.The ‘Nepal Trade Integration Strategy 2023’ identifies Chyangra Pashmina as a highly prioritised exportable product. Similarly, the 'Pashmina Sector Export National Strategy 2022-2026' aims to elevate Pashmina exports to the $75 million mark by 2026.Speaking on the occasion, Joint-secretary Adhikari said, “Nepal’s Himalayan Chyangra Pashmina holds a distinguished position in the international market due to its unique quality and cultural significance. The government of Nepal has designated Pashmina as one of the high-priority exportable products. The guide is poised to become a useful source of information about the process for Nepali Pashmina exports, offering comprehensive information about our destination markets.”Ferran said, “As a longstanding partner in Nepal's development journey, the European Union reaffirms its unwavering dedication to bolstering Nepal's prosperity through enhanced trade and investment avenues. This comprehensive guide serves as an instrument to support the Pashmina value chain to harness the immense potential of Nepal’s Chyangra Pashmian in the international market.” \nNcell, Nepal's largest foreign investor, launches \"Sadhain ON\" campaign, waiving unintended mobile data charges and reducing data plans to 20 to prepare customers for 5G.\nEU-Nepal Business Forum 2024 inaugurated by Prime Minister Dahal, emphasizing green economy, ease of doing business, and shared prosperity with EU investment.\nPre-monsoon rains increase dengue outbreak concerns, with alarming case numbers reported and experts urging preventive measures to avert a health crisis.\nDue to alarmingly rising maternal deaths, Nepal's Health Ministry plans to screen pregnant women for mental health issues, which have emerged as a major cause, aiming to cut down on preventable deaths and achieve UN's target of reducing maternal mortality to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.\nKathmandu Health Office trains 50 health workers to screen for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health problems in local health facilities.\nIn nine months of the current fiscal year, the Department of Drug Administration has tested 348 samples of medicines collected by its drug inspectors from across the country.Of nearly 20,000 medicines, both registered and unregistered ones in the market, drug inspectors had collected for testing hundreds of samples of drugs suspected to be substandard.However, the department, which is also the national regulatory body of the drug market, carried out tests on less than two percent of the total registered drugs in the country.“Some samples of medicines collected by our drug inspectors some 13 months ago are yet to be tested,” said Narayan Dhakal, director general of the department. “Some samples suspected to be substandard and collected for a quality test might already have expired.”Ensuring the quality of medicines being prescribed to patients is the responsibility of the department. Its drug inspectors collect samples of medicines on a random basis from the market and send them for lab tests at the National Medicines Laboratory under the department.Officials at the DDA said several samples of medicines on which quality testing was carried out in the current fiscal year were found substandard and recalled from the market.Dhakal concedes that the samples tested by the department are not sufficient to ensure the quality of the medicines.“We have tested too few samples,” an official at the department said. “And the fact is some medicines on which tests were done were found to be substandard, which means other drugs in the market also could be problematic. Patients might have been taking substandard medicines.”Experts say the use of substandard medicines could adversely affect patients’ health. Dhakal said that ensuring the quality of the medicines is also the responsibility of the drug manufacturing companies and it is not possible to test each and every medicine.“I must concede that we have not tested nearly enough medicines to ensure quality,” said Dhakal. “Several factors including understaffing are responsible for this.”Around 40 staffers have been serving in the National Medicines Laboratory under the department.Ensuring the quality of medicines in Nepal has always been an issue, as the national drug regulator grapples with a staff crunch, and its laboratory doesn't have the capacity to carry out timely tests.Drug inspectors deployed from the DDA take random samples of drugs and send them for testing to the government’s laboratory. If drugs are found problematic or substandard, the department directs the manufacturing companies to recall those drugs from the market. However, the department does not have an effective mechanism to ensure the recall either.In most cases, delays in testing at the laboratory mean that results come in only after all the substandard drugs in the market have been sold.While thousands of medicines manufactured by national as well as international pharma companies are being sold from pharmacies across the country, DDA inspectors collect only around 1,000 samples in a year. The inspection work is especially hard as the DDA has just around two dozen drug inspectors tasked with monitoring over 21,000 registered pharmacies and thousands of unregistered ones.Moreover, it takes several months to examine some medicines as the DDA’s laboratory is understaffed with several posts for technicians remaining vacant. The department allows the drug manufacturing companies to supply medicines to the market directly from the factory. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nIndia captain Sunil Chhetri, the country’s most prolific footballer, will retire from international football after the World Cup qualifier against Kuwait on June 6, the 39-year-old announced on Thursday.Chhetri has been the face of Indian football for nearly a decade-and-half and his 94 international goals make him the third-highest active international goalscorer after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.“It was not that I was feeling tired,” Chhetri said in a video he posted on social media.“When the instinct came this should be my last game, I thought about it a lot and eventually I came to this decision.”“Will I be sad after this? Of course...the kid inside me never wants to stop if given a chance to play for his country.”“It’s time for our country to see the next number nine.”Chhetri is also India’s most-capped player having played 150 international matches since his debut against Pakistan in 2005.“Your legacy on and off-the-field will always be remembered,” the All India Football Federation (AIFF) said in a post on X.“Thank you @chetrisunil11 for your leadership, dedication and commitment to Indian football.” \nThe 12th edition of the Kantipur Half Marathon is all set to take place on May 18.“Preparations for the 2024 Kantipur Half Marathon are now complete,” Mahesh Swar, chief executive officer of Kantipur Publications Limited, said during a press meet on Wednesday.This year’s half marathon, which carries a slogan ‘Run to inspire the young’, will feature men’s and women’s half marathon (21.1 km), Corporate run (5 km), college run (7 km) and wheelchair race (3 km). The college run was added to the event from the 2023 edition.The 21.1 km half marathon—the main event of the annual road running event—will start from the Central Business Park, the office of Kantipur Publications at Thapathali, and will traverse through Maitighar Mandala, Baneshwar, Tinkune, Koteshwar, Jadibuti, Lokanthali, Ghatthaghar, Thimi, Sallaghari chowk and return via the same route before finishing at the starting point.The winners of the men’s and women’s half-marathon will bag a purse of Rs100,000 each. The runner-up will receive Rs50,000, while the third-placed, fourth-placed, fifth-placed and sixth-placed runners will get Rs30,000, Rs20,000, Rs10,000 and Rs5,000, respectively.The winner, runner-up and the third-place finisher in the wheelchair category will earn Rs30,000, Rs20,000 and Rs10,000, respectively.The top-three finishers of corporate run and college run will also receive various prizes and gift hampers.The players’ registration for the event will close on Thursday.Organiser Kantipur Media Group expects a participation of more than 3,000 runners across all the events this year.Kantipur Media Group first organised the road-running event on February 19, 2011 to commemorate its 18th anniversary. More than 1,000 runners had participated in the first edition. The event has been continued annually since, establishing itself as one of the premier distance running events in the country.The first seven editions took place on the Publication’s anniversary day.The latter editions are being held on different dates in order to make the event a separate sports discipline, according to organisers.Tribhuvan Army Club’s Mukesh Pal and Nepal Police Club’s Rajpura Pachhai are the defending champions of the men’s and women’s titles of the 21.1 km race respectively.Kanchi Maya Koju is the most successful athlete in the women’s half marathon, having won five of the past eight editions.Hari Kumar Rimal has won the men’s half marathon four times. \nSantoo Shrestha on Wednesday made history by becoming the first Nepali table tennis player to qualify for the Olympics.Shrestha qualified for the men’s singles table tennis competition at the 2024 Summer Olympics after he defeated his compatriot Samyog Kapali 11-7, 8-11, 11-7, 11-6, 8-11, 11-9 in the final of the 2024 South Asian Qualification Tournament, which was held in Table Tennis Training Centre in Kathmandu.The 2024 Olympics is scheduled to be held from July 26 to August 11 in Paris, France.Shrestha had defeated Sri Lanka’s Chameera Ginige 11-7, 11-9, 6-11, 8-11, 11-3, 11-8 to enter the gold medal match, while Kapali was a 13-11, 11-7, 12-10, 11-7 winner against Jayasanka De Silva, also from Sri Lanka.Shrestha also became the third Nepali player to qualify for the Olympics after Sangina Baidhya at Athens 2004 and Deepak Bista in Beijing 2008. Both Baidhya and Bista are taekwondo players and practitioners.Nepal will be making its 15th appearance at the Summer Olympics since making a debut in 1964.Track and field athlete Santoshi Shrestha and badminton player Prince Dahal will also represent Nepal at Paris 2024.Santoshi and Dahal gained entry into the Olympics after receiving universality spots.Santoshi will participate in the women's marathon while Dahal will compete in the men's singles badminton event.Dahal will be the first badminton player from Nepal to participate at the Olympics. \nAfter sealing pledges of a “new era” of strategic partnership with China’s Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday is set to highlight the growing importance of trade near the Russian border in China’s northeast.Putin ends his two-day, red-carpet visit to China in Harbin in Heilongjiang province, which has long-running trade and cultural ties to Russia, touring a Russian-China Expo and a forum on interregional cooperation.Facing political isolation and Western sanctions over Russia’s two-year-old invasion of Ukraine, Putin is increasingly turning to China to support its war economy.Amid the pomp of a full state visit, Putin and Xi signed a joint statement on Thursday that hailed the “new era”, countering the US across a sweep of security and economic issues and a shared global view.“The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it,” Xi told Putin.“China is willing to... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world.”The joint statement fleshes out the “no limits” partnership the two declared in February 2022, days before Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into neighbouring Ukraine, launching the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two.Beijing is helping Moscow’s war effort by providing drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools, U.S. officials said last month, although China says it has not provided weaponry to any party.Russia’s isolation from other powers has fuelled its trade with China, which surged 26.3% last year to a record $240.1, Chinese customs data shows. Russia has overtaken Saudi Arabia as China’s top source of crude oil, with shipments jumping more than 24% despite Western sanctions.An editorial in China’s state-controlled Global Times newspaper on Friday cited the importance of burgeoning trade ties to the wider relationship, saying China had been Russia’s largest trading partner for 13 straight years.“These achievements are not easy and have been achieved by both countries overcoming various external challenges and unfavorable factors, highlighting the solid foundation of the China-Russia relationship,” the editorial said.Putin is flanked by a large trade delegation, which includes Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina.Others include the heads of Russia’s largest banks - Sberbank (SBER.MM), opens new tab CEO German Gref and VTB (VTBR.MM), opens new tab chief Andrei Kostin - billionaire Oleg Deripaska, top oil producer Rosneft (ROSN.MM), opens new tab chief Igor Sechin and liquefied natural gas giant Novatek’s boss, Leonid Mikhelson.It was not immediately clear if Putin would make any further stops in Asia. \nBritain’s food watchdog has applied extra control measures on all spice imports from India, it said on Wednesday, becoming the first to ramp up scrutiny of all Indian spices after contamination allegations against two brands sparked concerns among global food regulators.Hong Kong last month suspended sales of three spice blends produced by MDH and one by Everest, saying they contained high levels of a cancer-causing pesticide ethylene oxide.Singapore also ordered a recall of the Everest mix, and New Zealand, the United States, India and Australia have since said they are looking into issues related to the two brands.MDH and Everest—two of India’s most popular brands—have said their products are safe for consumption.In the most stringent crackdown so far impacting all Indian spices, the UK’s Food Standards Agency (FSA) said that in light of the concerns it has “applied extra control measures for pesticide residues in spices from India which includes ethylene oxide”.The agency did not elaborate on the exact steps it is taking.“The use of ethylene oxide is not allowed here and maximum residue levels are in place for herbs and spices,” James Cooper, Deputy Director of Food Policy at the FSA, said in a statement to Reuters.India’s Spices Board, which regulates exports, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. India is the biggest exporter, consumer and producer of spices in the world.In 2022 Britain imported $128 million worth of spices, with India accounting for almost $23 million, data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity website shows.MDH and Everest export their products to many regions including the US, Europe, South East Asia, Middle East and Australia.Indian regulators have also conducted testing of all spice products and inspected samples of MDH and Everest products, though no results have been made public so far.MDH has since 2021 seen an average 14.5 percent of its US shipments rejected over the presence of bacteria salmonella, a Reuters analysis of US FDA data has found.On Wednesday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency told Reuters in a statement it was aware of the concerns around MDH and Everest’s products and “continues to monitor the situation”.“Based on current information, we have no evidence to suggest that the issues raised affect products currently in the Canadian market,” it said. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nUsing electricity as a clean energy source in Nepal is crucial due to indoor air pollution caused by contaminating fuels, leading to health risks and deaths, while promoting e-cooking can boost domestic electricity consumption and reduce LPG gas imports, contributing to national development and sustainable energy goals.\nThe government will present the budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024/25 in a few days. In Nepal’s federal structure, functional responsibilities are devolved to the sub-federal levels while revenue remains centralised. The constitution aims to decentralise revenue through legislation. To achieve this, fiscal transfers to the sub-federal levels are ensured by the constitution. These fiscal transfers are done through four grants: Fiscal equalisation, conditional, special, and matching grants. Among these grants, the fiscal equalisation grant is vital; it is considered unconditional and includes full autonomy to the subnational governments.Between FY2018/19 and FY2023/24, all seven provinces received an average annual grant of Rs112 billion, while local levels received Rs261 billion. Annually, each province received an average of Rs16 billion and local levels received around Rs350 million in grants from the Government of Nepal. Although the local levels receiving Rs350 million yearly sounds positive from the outside, the situation looks disappointing from within.The principle of grants stipulates that the ratio of fiscal equalisation grants to the total budget or GDP should increase. However, this ratio has decreased. Consequently, the proportion of equalisation grants allocated to the sub-federal levels in the total budget was 10.27 percent in FY2018/19, declining to 8.34 percent in FY2023/24. This indicates a serious flaw in grant distribution, necessitating improvement. The situation is even more disappointing at the local level, where the percentage of equalisation grants among the four grants received was 41.38 percent in FY2018/19, with conditional grants comprising 53.74 percent. In FY2023/24, the percentage of equalisation grants decreased to 29.61 percent, while conditional grants increased to 65 percent. This highlights the disproportionate burden of conditional grants at the local level. The share of special and matching grants in the total grant is only 5 percent. However, the government has yet to understand the definition of a special grant. Matching grants will be distributed based on the demand of sub-federal levels to fill the resource gap in certain projects and programmes. The government will distribute the special grant based on the supply side after considering factors such as poverty scenarios, among others, at the sub-federal levels. Furthermore, this grant is also used to compensate for the Fiscal Equalisation Grant. The government has not yet considered this aspect, and it should seriously review all types of grant allocations, including special and matching grants.Grant distribution remains unfair, with no improvement in the trend of people visiting ministers and ministries for programmes and projects. From local government chiefs to federal parliamentarians, ministries are overcrowded. Many ministries allocate programme budgets at their discretion, with a significant portion favouring the constituencies of the prime minister and ministers. Subsequently, the budget is directed towards senior leaders, influential parliamentarians, secretaries, and so forth. This situation mirrors the pre-federalisation era, albeit with a slightly reduced budget being distributed haphazardly. During discussions on the ministerial budget for FY2023/24 in parliament, I raised concerns about the projects and programmes of certain ministries. The allocated program budget is even lower than that of previous village development committees.The World Bank published a report on Monday that was consistent with the facts stated above. Specifically, the report unveiled the 'Nepal Fiscal Federalism Update 2024', which aims to assess Nepal's progress in fiscal federalism and examine the alignment between the 2015 Constitution's fiscal federalism vision and present realities.The report reveals that fiscal balances of sub-federal levels slipped into deficit in FY2022/23 for the first time since the implementation of fiscal federalism in Nepal. Provincial governments recorded a consolidated fiscal balance deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in FY2022/23, attributed to decreased revenue and grants, which dropped to a record low of 3.5 percent of GDP. Conversely, expenditure saw only a marginal increase to 3.8 percent of GDP. However, there was notable variation in fiscal balances among provinces, ranging from a deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in Sudurpashchim to a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in Madhesh. Local governments also experienced a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in FY2022/23, stemming from a significant decrease in revenue and grants compared to the previous fiscal year. The report further highlights a decline in consolidated revenue and grants of sub-federal levels to a record low in FY2022/23, mainly due to reduced intergovernmental grants and revenue sharing. Provincial governments' revenue and grants dropped to 3.5 percent of GDP, driven by a decrease in intergovernmental revenue, constituting over 90 percent of provincial revenue. Local government revenue and grants declined to 8 percent of GDP in FY2022/23. Despite the decline in fiscal transfers from the federal to local levels, provincial transfers to localities remained unchanged. Notably, property taxes and local government service fees constituted over 70 percent of local governments' own-source revenue. Regarding expenditure, provincial government spending slightly increased to 3.8 percent of GDP, driven by elevated capital spending, particularly in infrastructure projects. Recurrent expenditure accounted for only 40 percent of total provincial expenditure. Conversely, local government spending saw a marginal decrease to 8.4 percent of GDP in FY2022/23 primarily due to reduced capital spending. A significant gap persists between sub-federal levels' expenditure and revenue, with only 8 percent of provincial spending and 6 percent of local spending financed by own revenue, leading to a marginal increase in the vertical fiscal gap in FY2022/23. The report also notes stagnation in own-source revenue collection, indicating moderate improvement in revenue assignment policies and weaknesses in revenue administration. It emphasises the necessity of upgrading institutional arrangements to manage the fiscal transfer system effectively. It highlights the absence of a legal provision/procedure for determining the pool of funds to be transferred through fiscal transfers and recommends increasing the ratio of Fiscal Equalisation Grants within the pool of resources to strengthen sub-federal levels' planning and decision-making. Moreover, the report suggests establishing transparent, consultative processes and technical methodologies for determining the divisible pool for fiscal transfers to enhance predictability and increase fiscal autonomy at sub-federal levels. The major challenge identified within the fiscal transfer system is the allocation of conditional grants, for which the bank proposes reducing conditional grants while enhancing fiscal equalisation, retaining conditional grants for federal responsibilities delegated to sub-federal levels, and allocating funds based on transparent criteria and procedures to align with the needs of sub-federal levels. Lastly, the report recommends determining and publishing grant amounts earlier in the fiscal year to facilitate improved planning and execution. Coming back to the budget, most ministries at the federal level act no less than those in the Rana era, with ministers often allocating budgets solely to their constituencies. Projects are frequently sent to the sub-federal levels as conditional grants. The constitution designates the province as the key entity for development, emphasising that infrastructure development should be led by the province, not the federal ministry—a principle underscored in the constitution. Out of the 22 ministries at the federal level, we need just between eight and ten, as more than half of the ministries overstep their jurisdiction. When presenting the budget, the government should embrace the spirit of the constitution and acknowledge the existence of provincial and local governments. \nAfter a months-long heatwave, the recent rainfall in Nepal brought much-needed relief and helped put out wildfires. Unfortunately, the rainwater, coupled with warmth, also created a favourable environment for dengue-carrying mosquitoes. As a result, dengue cases are already on the rise, with 57 districts reporting dengue infection, and over 50 cases were reported in a single week. Experts believe the worst is yet to come. Even though dengue has taken many lives in the past few years (20 deaths in 2023, 88 in 2022 and six in 2019) and infected many (52,000 in 2023, 54,000 in 2022 and 16,000 in 2019), it remains the most neglected virus. Authorities seem to care little either about its spread or severity. Nor do they try to understand the changing nature of the virus from climate change and rising temperatures through research and tests. A Dengue Action Plan is in place, but the government hasn’t been able to do enough to contain the spread of the virus except relying on traditional methods like surveillance of the virus, serotyping of the dengue-carrying mosquitoes, plus treatment, management and collaboration with local levels. Even the action plan acknowledges that the country’s dengue spread has gone out of hand, making it difficult to contain. Nepal is unable to undertake year-round surveillance and prevention programmes due to budgetary limits. The action plan clearly states that there’s no budget to deal with dengue throughout the year. This was bound to happen as the health ministry’s budget was reduced this fiscal year, discontinuing many programmes. Moreover, even the budget allocated for a particular fiscal year (for example in 2022-23) is used up before March/April, when cases usually surge. These months, as experts suggest, are crucial, as stopping the spread of the virus just when the cases are rising is the most effective way to cut down on the number of deaths and infections throughout the year. Apart from insufficient budget, the country also lacks entomologists, and no other ministry is held responsible for the work except health.The situation will only worsen the longer these challenges are overlooked. And removing the dengue menace should not be the sole responsibility of the health ministry. The finance ministry should allocate enough budget to drive dengue prevention measures for a whole year; the environment ministry can implement environmental policies to control the breeding sites of mosquitoes, and urge people to maintain sanitation and proper waste management; the urban development ministry must manage drainage systems and green spaces; while the transportation ministry needs to prevent the accumulation of stagnant water on roads. Only such a collective measure will help reduce dengue dangers.While continuing with awareness programmes, door-to-door campaigns and search-find-destroy drives should also be pushed on a regular basis. There is a strong case for learning from other countries. For instance, eDengue systems implemented in Malaysia could be used to report cases from rural parts of Nepal and detect severe cases for timely medical intervention. The onus is also on the public to take preventive measures on a year-round basis. Again, dengue is not something that only the government can control. If we don’t work together, many of us will needlessly suffer.  \nSenior leaders from seven major political parties—both the ruling as well as opposition forces—on Sunday made an unequivocal collective pledge to make maximum effort to promote the country’s investment and business climate. Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, CPN (Maoist Centre) vice-chair Pampha Bhusal, Rastriya Prajatantra Party chair Rajendra Lingden, Rastriya Swatantra Party Chief Whip Santosh Pariyar, CPN (Unified Socialist) General Secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal and Janamat Party chair CK Raut, while airing their respective party’s views at the Kantipur Economic Summit-2024, also emphasised the need for the political forces and other stakeholders to work hand in hand in order to attract investment.It was just two weeks ago that top leaders of the country including Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba of Nepali Congress and KP Sharma Oli, chair of a major coalition partner CPN-UML, while addressing the two-day Investment Summit, committed to spare no effort to turn Nepal into an investment-friendly destination. Presenting Nepal as a country of huge potential, the leaders made the promises before 1,600-plus representatives from 55 countries in the government-organised summit. Realisation of the need for domestic as well as foreign investments and joint political commitments of rival political forces in itself is a positive gesture.However this is not enough. Nepal’s politicians have time and again made such promises but failed to translate them into results. For that, Nepal still needs political as well as policy stability and predictability. Various countries have made tremendous progress even when there is instability in government leadership. They did so by keeping development activities separate from politics and ensuring policy predictability, even if there are constant changes in governments. One big concern of the representatives from the business communities expressed at the Kantipur Economic Summit was the same. They said genuine investors seek policy predictability as a prerequisite before making a sizable investment. This is a valid concern and the policy makers must ensure so much.Yet the initiatives of the government and our politicians appear more superficial than substantive. Just ahead of the investment summit, the government amended some Acts through an ordinance to clear legal complexities for investment. It was the government’s intent to create an impression before the international participants that Nepal is serious about getting money from abroad. But the ordinances couldn’t be tabled in the first meeting of the House of Representatives on Friday due to the ongoing obstruction of the main opposition party Nepali Congress. There is a prolonged deadlock in Parliament. The ruling and opposition parties are in a face-off over a parliamentary panel to probe Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The minister is accused of involvement in multiple cooperative frauds. The House obstruction by the main opposition over the demand first made in the winter session has continued even after the commencement of the budget session on May 10. If our political parties cannot even come together to pass the national budget, it would be hard for foreigners to trust us with their money. The only way Nepal will attract quality investment and make a leap in its development endeavour is through a collective political effort to ensure policy consistency. For the country’s larger good, they must also be able to see beyond their partisan interests.  \nAs the midsummer mercury rises, storing fresh food remains a challenge. In a country where the usage of refrigerators remains limited to urban areas, there is a risk of food getting contaminated. Moreover, our general attitude towards food safety and preservation, especially in eateries, is casual. For instance, we see meat shops openly displaying raw meat items all day on tables and showcases, without the use of freezers. Sweet shops and restaurants are no better, as they are tempted to display their food items to attract customers. Even though the food might look appealing to our eyes when it is served in eateries, it is ultimately harmful to our health as many do not follow the proper food safety protocols. The open display of food items invites bacteria and dust contamination, apart from the obvious heat-related hazards, leading to the onslaught of various diseases, including cholera and food poisoning, apart from a lack of nutrition. Although Nepal has food safety regulations in place, the lack of implementation and monitoring continues to pose the risk of food-borne diseases to the public. The Food Act, 2023 (1967) prohibits the production, sale or distribution of adulterated foodstuff or sub-standard foodstuff. By adulterated foodstuff, the Act means \"foodstuffs rotten so as to be harmful to health, or prepared or kept in a filthy or toxic condition\". In January last year, Nepal implemented a new set of food safety regulations, which has provisions for the careful production, processing, packaging, handling, storage and supply purity of food. The regulations also have provisions for labelling the food, including its nutritional value.However, apart from poor implementation of such regulations, the monitoring of the regulations is almost non-existent. In rare instances when food inspectors from municipalities bother to monitor the food in eateries, there is a high chance of such eateries being found flouting the regulations. For instance, in Kathmandu, as in most parts of the country, food items, especially items like meat that get contaminated quickly, are laid out in the open and sold. This causes great health risks, but the authorities of all levels of government seem either oblivious to or uninterested in the issue. In Kathmandu Metropolitan City, for instance, the authorities' focus is on removing the food vendors altogether, guided by a flawed notion of gentrification rather than regulating them under tax and food safety regimes. In other parts of the country, hardly anyone bothers to check the quality of food provided to customers.The state cannot remain a mute spectator when the health of the citizens is put at risk due to the carelessness of vendors. Rather, the state should strictly maintain food safety standards regularly—not in an episodic pattern, such as during festivals or at the whims of authorities but as a standard practice. Some basic steps include making it mandatory for vendors to keep appropriate food items in freezers, use covering, and segregate food items to avoid cross-contamination. As the culture of eating out is becoming increasingly common, especially among young people, the state should actively enforce food preservation and safety regulations to keep the citizens healthy. \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   \nThe budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nFire incidents have surged in Nepal, with over 3,000 incidents in 2023, fueled by inadequate rainfall, high temperatures, wind gusts, and increased stubble burning, leading to the loss of lives, the destruction of settlements, and ecosystem damage, highlighting the need for increased training, equipment, and awareness campaigns to mitigate the situation.\nNepal hosts third Investment Summit to attract Foreign Direct Investment, aiming to learn from previous shortcomings and improve investment-friendly policies.\nPolitical parties' power struggles in forming provincial governments, coupled with leaders blaming the mixed electoral system for instability, have led to a rise in public frustration with the provinces.\nJung Bahadur's 1854 Muluki Ain codified laws, replacing arbitrary rulings, established institutions with defined powers, and recognized the rule of law while acknowledging the caste system and addressing its injustices.\nSinohydro denies non-payment of promised taxes to Helambu for construction materials, citing legal sourcing and recycling of discarded materials.\nDespite Japan's labor shortages and memorandum with Nepal, Nepali workers face challenges in finding SSW positions in Japan due to misunderstandings, including the misconception of government involvement and the exclusion of third-party agencies.\nMichael Hutt acknowledges Deepak Thapa's concerns about Nepali studies in Euro-America, particularly at SOAS, where Krishna Pradhan's retirement in 2019 has led to the discontinuation of Nepali courses, jeopardizing future studies in the UK.\nDespite illegality, Chhaupadi, a menstrual taboo practice in Nepal, persists, requiring stronger punishment, societal condemnation, and reporting of unrevealed cases.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.
