Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAmid criticism from Nepali Congress leaders, Nepal and China agreed to implement Belt and Road Initiative projects under \"aid assistance financing,\" raising concerns about loan implications.\nNepal has begun exporting tea to China after Beijing eased import procedures, opening up a potential new market for Nepali tea producers who have faced challenges exporting to India.\nThapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital provides breast milk from its human milk bank to vulnerable infants born in other hospitals, aiming to reduce neonatal deaths.\nJanakpur Bolts and Sudurpaschim Royals maintained their undefeated streaks in the NPL T20, as Lalit Rajbanshi's 3-31 and Saud's fifer wrecked Pokhara Avengers and Kathmandu Gurkhas, respectively, while James Neesham's 40* guided Janakpur to victory.\nChitwan Rhinos set a target of 131 runs for Karnali Yaks in the first match of the Nepal Premier League, with Ravi Bopara contributing 59 not out and Bipin Prasad Sharma taking 3 wickets for Karnali.\nTo its credit, the team of KP Sharma Oli in Beijing somehow convinced the Chinese to sign the BRI framework agreement on Wednesday. The Chinese don’t do hasty negotiations. A day earlier, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had met his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang. On the same evening, there was a meeting between Oli and Chinese President Xi Jinping. A joint statement was issued later in the day, outlining all the major developments of Oli’s trip. The much-hyped framework for BRI cooperation had found no mention in the statement. China watchers back home started bemoaning the ‘abject failure’ of Oli’s China trip. But then Team Oli, which included his chief advisor Bishnu Rimal and chief economic advisor Yubaraj Khatiwada, pulled a rabbit out of the bag.The final terminology used to describe the money that will come into Nepal under the BRI rubric has some ambiguity, as ‘aid financing modalities’ can include both grants and loans. But then, such in-between terminologies are common in bilateral negotiations where each side is looking to keep certain constituencies back home happy. The important thing is that both the top leaders of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties in the country, agreed on the term. And when it was presented to the Chinese, so did they. The ‘aid financing modalities’ do not preclude all kinds of loans. In fact, the understanding seems to be that the term means that Nepal will consider low-interest loans such as it was getting from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. That is how it should be. How can Nepal accept loans from the rest of the world but shun it from China? The Congress leadership also seems to have realised the flaw in its earlier reasoning that no kind of loan from China was acceptable. The good thing is that the agreement with China is likely to last as it has the backing of the country’s two major parties, who together make nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority. It was the differences between these two on loans from China that helped them flesh out the outstanding issues over the BRI framework. This in turn added clarity to the issues. (Some differences on the BRI persist inside the Congress, but that is to be expected in a democratic party.) Perhaps the Chinese this time thought that even though they were being asked to hurry, the proposal on the table, which had the backing of Nepal’s two major political parties, was worth signing. There are still many unknowns about the BRI. But at least Nepal stood its ground when necessary, while also not being rigid. This signals a maturing of Nepali diplomacy. After the BRI framework agreement, we again hope that the Congress and the UML and other parties can come to similar understandings on Nepal’s relations with India and the US–and on Nepal’s other vital ties. Consensual foreign policy is the need of the hour. Right now, it is worth celebrating that China, which harboured deep suspicions of the Congress, will be more amenable to dealing with Nepal’s biggest party. Their mutual suspicions were poisoning Nepal-China relations. Perhaps the long-stuck train of the BRI in Nepal will now finally start chugging.  \nFor several weeks now, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) of the Government of Nepal has put out a draft text in Nepali on its website of the “National Book Policy, 2081 BS”. In the paragraph headed “Background”, the text states, “For quality education and learning, we need quality books. For the easy availability of quality books, their creation, production, distribution and storage aspects need to be strengthened and their writing, translation, editing, production, publication, printing, distribution, and sale aspects need to be developed and managed.” It adds that the Government of Nepal has drafted this policy to do all of the above.In the same section, the text further delineates a litany of problems facing the sector. Apart from the new challenges emanating from readers spending too much time looking at various types of screens and too little time reading books, the problems listed are pretty much the same as those identified in related discussions held in the 1990s. The policy draft text lists six objectives in very generic terms. For instance, objective three reads: “To enhance the professional capacity of sectors related to the writing, publication, preservation and promotion of books.” Under the subsequently given execution strategies, the policy draft lists three strategies that align with the above-mentioned objective three. They deal with managing the intellectual property rights of various contents, creating a national book depository/book bank and the development and diversification of how libraries are run in the country. These are further discussed in the subsequently given karyanitis. In a section titled “The Bases for the Execution of this Policy”, it is mentioned that the MoEST will produce the necessary working procedure for resource management and related criteria and also coordinate with provincial and local governments. For the execution, monitoring and evaluation of this policy, the draft proposes creating a National Book Council under the chairmanship of the minister or state minister of the MoEST. The council’s secretariat will be the appropriate division in the same ministry. Under the sub-title “The Management of Financial Sources”, the policy draft generically states that “the necessary financial resources needed to execute this policy will be managed.”The brief extracts given above from the 16-page “National Book Policy” draft should convince the readers that the entire text reads like a pious but generic tract, full of good intentions that are unlikely to be implemented for lack of proper identification of where the challenges lie and at what levels they need to be tackled. So, it is not clear what has prompted the process of creating this kind of draft at the moment. Given the emphasis that libraries get on it, is there some association of librarians currently behind this idea? Or perhaps some bureaucrats in the MoEST wanted to please their bosses by working on the policy draft, which, it is stated, was generated after “continuous discussions” with “pertinent stakeholders.” The stakeholders haven’t been listed in the text. As a member of a research organisation which has published 116 academic books on a broad variety of subjects in the past 23 years and promoted books through the hosting of numerous book discussions and commissioning of their reviews in two journals, we were not invited to any such discussion at the MoEST or elsewhere.Getting it rightThose who run the federal bureaucracy don’t seem to understand (or if they do, they don’t care about) some fundamental points. First, creating another entity at the centre, namely, a National Book Council under the chairmanship of a minister in the federal MoEST, will do virtually nothing to produce better-quality books. In particular, such an entity cannot enhance the professional capacity of writers, publishers, librarians and other promoters of books. For sure, the council will be a good place to reward some senior bureaucrats or party-affiliated buddhijibis as members but it would simply be institutionally too far from the creators of book contents to be of any real consequence. Second, we need a distributed mechanism of incentive provision that is much closer to the book creators. Let me explain by thinking about the kinds of people currently involved in producing books—just academic books for this analysis—in Nepal. Such books are being produced by colleagues who work for universities in Nepal and elsewhere, others who work in academic NGOs and think tanks and the rest (including journalists) who are independent researchers. For those affiliated with universities in Nepal, the way to incentivise the production of books is through offering writing fellowships from their mother institutions with earmarked funds in the budgets provided to the universities by the University Grants Commission. Such fellowships make the book writing possible, and it could then be published by university-owned publishing presses, about which I wrote recently (“On University Presses”, November 1). Similarly, for researchers who work in academic NGOs or are institutionally independent, the disbursement of such grants from an already existing federal government entity would be helpful initially. In the long run, however, as I have argued many times, this function can be handled by a Social Science Research Council run by academics. In other words, public money must support the creation of books through relevant closer-to-the-creator institutions. Third, if the policy seeks to repurpose existing entities, they must be appropriately equipped for the additional function. For instance, the policy seeks to task the existing National Library as the national depository of books (“Book Bank”). For this, the draft says the necessary legal provisions will be made. That is a minor thing compared to the main challenge faced by the National Library for a long time, namely, it is a severely under-budgeted institution. Since the building in which the library was housed until 2015 was damaged by the earthquakes of that year, it has been homeless. Its proposed building in Jamal in Kathmandu has not materialised yet, and as far as I can tell, no government seems to be in a rush to complete it soon. In a country where the rebuilding of the Dharahara is prioritised over the National Library, it seems a bit dishonest to task the latter institution with additional responsibilities without first erecting its proper building and provisioning it with extra funds and human personnel. We don’t need another policy text for that.Fourth, instead of promoting new public libraries under the rubric that all local political jurisdictions should have one such entity, all three levels of government need to support existing librarians with block and incentive-driven grants. Many other things could be said about the policy draft, but a list of pious intentions will not give us better books. Instead, the Government of Nepal needs to provide public funds to real stakeholders who have been doing relatively good things for the book sector with their own meagre resources. \nIt's been more than a year since the October 7 events, when militants from the Palestinian group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing hundreds and taking dozens of hostages.The Israeli retaliation which followed was brutal and seemed to have no red lines. Already under blockade before October 7, Israel imposed a complete siege on the Gaza Strip, limiting the entry of food, fuel and medicines. There was a clear intent to starve and permanently displace the population. A few months into the assault, Gaza turned into a wasteland, with almost the entire population displaced and more than 80 percent of buildings destroyed. It is not surprising that the International Criminal Court, in its recent verdict, concluded that there was strong evidence for crimes against humanity while issuing the arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Aside from the nearly 45,000 official deaths, a large number of which are women and children, the year-long carnage in Gaza has also brought forth harsh aspects of the contemporary world order. Wither international law?The year in Gaza has shown the irrelevance of international law and organisations. Over the past year, the United Nations (UN) has issued daily warnings and reported on the dire humanitarian situation, and passed resolutions in the general assembly appealing for a ceasefire, all to no avail. Time and again, Israel has been bailed out in the UN Security Council by its Western allies, in particular, the US. The only resolution that managed to get passed in the Security Council did not result in any tangible steps towards a ceasefire. To be fair, the UN has been equally unsuccessful in stopping conflicts in other regions of the world, including Sudan and Ukraine, underscoring its broader inability to prevent and stop wars and conflicts. Concomitantly, Israel has wilfully disregarded international law on the protection of civilians in war. By insisting that the militants use civilians as ‘human shields’, Israel has blurred the well-established distinction in international law between combatants and non-combatants.There are reports that Israel used AI-powered systems to generate targets. Israeli strikes targeted hospitals, schools, shelters, ambulances and humanitarian zones, all contrary to basic human decency. Earlier this year, a tragic illustration of this was the death of seven volunteers from the World Central Kitchen who were bombed by an Israeli drone strike on their cars. Western connivance It was not just Israel that flouted the international law. The year in Gaza showed us that countries that usually voice concerns for human rights and denounce violence were willing collaborators.The US has flown more than 500 flights to Israel containing weapons and munitions. The most notorious of these were the US-made 2,000-pound bombs dropped on houses in Gaza. The UK and Germany have kept up with regular arms shipments and intelligence. Germany used the opportunity to its advantage, becoming the number two supplier of weapons to Israel over the past year. The shipment of arms and the diplomatic support to Israel was done with full knowledge of the actual events unfolding in Gaza. Thus, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken disregarded reports from his own state department that Israel was blocking US humanitarian assistance. Had he acted on them, US law would have forced the Biden administration to halt weapons supply to Gaza. Keir Starmer, the UK Prime Minister and a former lawyer who has advised on human rights issues, repeatedly denied in the British Parliament there was an ongoing genocide in Gaza. Compromised mainstream mediaThe year in Gaza has also revealed the role of mainstream Western media and exposed the claims of objectivity and fairness. From carrying false reports of beheaded babies to making unverifiable allegations of widespread sexual abuse on October 7, mainstream Western media went with Israel’s version of events. Israel has not allowed independent journalists inside the Gaza Strip, and everything it told the Western media, such as the presence of a Hamas command centre under Al Shifa Hospital, was taken at face value. Few, if any, mainstream journalists questioned the basis for the routine Israeli claim of militants hiding in the civilian population. We saw systematic internal bias by mainstream media organisations against Palestinians. Palestinian civilian losses were frequently described in the passive, with the briefest mention of Israeli strikes or shelling that caused their death. The New York Times published a front page photo of a Gaza boy with both his arms amputated under the caption ‘Surviving Gaza’; unless one turns to the whole story, one wouldn't learn what led to his condition. The bias was not limited to right-wing outlets. A leaked memo from the liberal New York Times revealed forbidding journalists from using the words ‘Palestine’, ‘apartheid’ or ‘genocide’ when talking about the events in Gaza. Earlier this October, a large number of former and present media persons signed a letter to protest the BBC's bias in its reporting of Gaza. The latest example of this bias was the wilful misrepresentation of clashes involving Israeli football fans and Amsterdam locals of Arab descent as ‘antisemitic’ while suppressing that the Israeli visitors had earlier clashed with locals, torn down flags, and chanted dehumanising slogans mocking the dead children of Gaza.Weakening of democratic freedoms The year in Gaza also made evident the repression of democratic protest and voices critical of Israel. From the initial days, large groups of protesters in western cities took to the streets, mostly peacefully, to call for an end to the violence. The protesters, sometimes numbering in the thousands, were smeared as ‘antisemitic’ and ‘Hamas supporters’ by Western officials. Countries with long traditions of protesting, such as France and Germany, outlawed protests. Wearing the Palestinian Keffiyeh or the Palestinian lapel was grounds for cancellation or denial of entry. Several independent journalists have been detained in the UK for supporting ‘proscribed’ groups. On the lines of the US Congress, the German parliament recently passed a unanimous resolution making civil society groups critical of Israel’s conduct unable to receive government aid. The UK and German governments now decide what is ‘acceptable’ freedom of speech.In an alternate world, Western countries, led by the US, would have long back imposed the two-state solution on close ally Israel. Palestinians would live in safety and dignity in their own state, free from Israeli occupation and control. That such a reality is far from being realised shows the cruel nature of the world order where there are different rules for different people. \nWith the by-elections to elect 44 local representatives in 32 districts done and dusted, reviews and analysis of the final results are pouring in thick and fast. Given the palpable discontent against the parties from across the political spectrum, predicting the bypolls results was not easy. Leaders from the CPN (Maoist Centre) have been in a celebratory mood since Tuesday after winning a couple of important seats after years of electoral setbacks. The former rebel outfit that emerged the clear first party in the 2008 general elections had been consistently losing votes and seats in subsequent polls.On the other hand, leaders from the CPN-UML don’t appear excited despite the party winning some important office bearer positions in different local units. The Nepali Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, lost some key positions in a few units as well. Unhappy with the results, the two largest parties have decided to review the outcomes through the respective party mechanisms.One noteworthy feature of the recent bypolls was that voters this time showed little faith in the new forces, unlike in the previous polls. Traditional fringe parties like the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party and the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist) that failed to get national party status in parliament in the last general elections picked up a seat each this time. But new forces such as the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Janamat Party didn’t do well. The RSP won only a ward chair in Kathmandu while the votes garnered by its candidates in other local units were negligible. The RSP, which emerged the fourth largest force in 2022 barely six months after its formation, had done better in the by-elections in April 2023. However, it couldn’t maintain the momentum when a by-election was held to elect a federal lawmaker from Ilam in April this year. The Janamat Party, another outfit that emerged from the last general election, failed to get even a single seat this time. Interestingly, the voters also discarded forces like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party that champions revival of the Hindu monarchy. The pro-monarchy party, the fifth largest in the federal legislature, didn’t win a single seat in Sunday by-polls.For long-term success, a political party needs to have clarity in its agenda and vision, a robust organisation, and strong bond with the general people. Elections are key yardsticks to gauge whether a political party has these strengths. There is broad consensus that the public is disenchanted with major political forces like the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre that have ruled this country by turns for the past two decades. People in previous elections gave a chance to new outfits as they were frustrated by the old forces’ failure to deliver. The level of support these new forces got was perhaps not an endorsement of their vision and agenda, which are sketchy. While these forces succeeded in fanning anger against the incumbents, they failed to offer anything better. Experts caution against drawing hasty conclusions based on the results of elections held for just 44 local level seats. Yet the by-polls were held across all seven provinces, and covered the capital city Kathmandu to remote villages, hills to plains, east to west. In sum, Nepalis are giving a clear message to the political forces old and new: do not take our support for granted.  \nUS President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday he has chosen former Senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China, tapping a former politician with business experience to help steer relations riven by deep mistrust and trade tensions.“He will be instrumental in implementing my strategy to maintain Peace in the region, and a productive working relationship with China’s leaders,” Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.Trump, who takes office on January 20, 2025, has said he will impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods unless Beijing does more to stop the trafficking of the highly addictive narcotic fentanyl.He also threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.Perdue, a Republican from Georgia who served in the Senate from 2015-2021, previously lived in Hong Kong during a 40-year career as a business executive.Perdue’s nomination marks a return to the frequent practice over recent decades of sending former politicians to the US embassy in Beijing, after President Joe Biden tapped veteran career diplomat Nicholas Burns in 2021.Trump has nominated China hardliners for other senior roles in his administration, including Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, in a signal his policy toward the United States’ main strategic rival could go beyond trade measures.In his first term as president, Trump named former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad as his ambassador to China. Branstad sought to leverage his ties with Chinese officials, including with Xi Jinping before he became China’s top leader, to help navigate trade tensions. But the two sides still plunged headlong into an unprecedented trade war.The ambassador’s role in fraught bilateral relations remains to be seen. Some analysts say Beijing is likely to seek direct presidential or high-level engagement with Trump and his closest advisers, in order to navigate the almost-certain return of trade tensions. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will appoint a new prime minister in the coming days whose top priority will be getting a 2025 budget adopted by parliament, he said on Thursday after the government was toppled by lawmakers.Michel Barnier, a veteran conservative, became the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history when he resigned on Thursday after parliament voted him out over his fiscal plans, barely three months after he was appointed.In a televised address to the nation, Macron said he would name a successor to Barnier “in the coming days.”“The priority will be the budget,” Macron said.A special law to roll over the 2024 budget and avoid any gap will be put forward by mid-December. Then the new government will prepare a full budget early next year, in particular to account for inflation, for a vote by parliament.Macron, whose ill-fated decision to call a snap ballot in June delivered a much-divided parliament, denied he was responsible for the political crisis.The president, who represents a centrist party, said the far-right and left-wing parties united in an “anti-republican front” to create “a mess” by ousting Barnier.Macron has been weakened by the crisis but resisted calls by some in the opposition for him to resign. He reaffirmed that he will stay in office until his term ends in May 2027.“The mandate you have given me is for five years and I will fulfil it until the very end,” he said.In a 10-minute speech, he added that the new government should represent a variety of parties willing to take part in it or at least agree not to censure it. He did not say which ones.Meanwhile, Macron has asked Barnier and his government to stay in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed.FISCAL DEFICIT, DIVIDED PARLIAMENTIt was unclear if a new government will be in place before a ceremony on Saturday to reopen Notre-Dame Cathedral, which has been renovated after a devastating fire. World leaders including U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are expected to attend.Macron cited the rebuilding of the Gothic cathedral and successful Paris Olympics over the summer as evidence that France can deliver.“They are proof that we can do great things. We can do the impossible,” he said. “The world admires us for that.”Macron had lunch on Thursday with Francois Bayrou, whose name has been cited by French media as a possible successor to Barnier, Le Parisien newspaper reported. An aide to Bayrou did not respond to a request for comment.Any new prime minister will face the same challenge of dealing with a fractured parliament that Barnier did, notably passing a budget at a time when France needs to rein in its public finances.French bonds and stocks rallied on Thursday on what some traders said was profit-taking following the widely expected outcome of parliament’s no-confidence vote that ousted Barnier. But the relief rally is unlikely to last, given the scale of political uncertainty.“Until potential new elections, ongoing political uncertainty is likely to keep the risk premium on French assets elevated,” SocGen analysts said in a note. The earliest possible date for a parliamentary election would be in July.The fall of France’s government leaves the country without a clear path towards reducing its fiscal deficit, and the most likely outcome is less belt-tightening than previously planned, credit rating agency Standard and Poor’s said. \nOn Friday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in Koshi and Gandaki Province along with the hilly regions of Bagmati and Gandaki Province. The rest of the country is to remain mainly fair.Light rain is likely to occur at one or two places of the hilly regions of Koshi Province.Tonight the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in the hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini Province and mainly fair in the rest of the country.According to the Meteorological analysis, the country is under partial influence of westerly winds.On Thursday Janakpur experienced the maximum temperature of 28°C, while Jumla registered the lowest at -4.9°C. No rainfall was reported across the country during the last 24 hours. \n\nThe Special Court has convicted four top officials in the corruption case involving the procurement of two wide-body Airbus A330 jets by Nepal Airlines Corporation, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’.The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) had filed a case against 32 individuals including the four after concluding that they caused a loss totalling Rs1.47 billion to the state coffers in the procurement deal. The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the payment of the last instalment in 2018.A bench of the court chair Tek Narayan Kunwar and members Tej Narayan Singh Rai and Ritendra Thapa convicted the then tourism secretary and ex-officio chair of the corporation, Shankar Adhikari; the corporation’s then general manager Sugat Ratna Kansakar; and then joint secretaries of the ministry Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane and Shishir Dhungana.The bench, however, acquitted the then tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, among others, who had been named as defendants by the anti-corruption body.The court has sentenced Kansakar to 2 years and six months in jail, Adhikari to 1 year and 9 months, and Dhungana and Lamichhane to 1 year and six months each in jail.In its charge sheet, the CIAA had accused the minister and the officials of going against the procurement law and accepting the supplier’s escalation condition to purchase second-hand aircraft, a condition which came to $6.78 million (Rs74.58 million) of the $209.6 million valuation. Escalation condition is a rule in a contract that says if certain things change, like prices, then the terms of the contract can also change. Investigators suspect that the condition was included in the $209.6 million deal to covertly generate kickbacks for the officials involved. \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has yet again postponed the general convention of its student wing All Nepal National Independent Students’ Union (Revolutionary).An office-bearers’ meeting of the party on Thursday decided to defer the 23rd general convention, which was slated to commence in the Capital on Sunday. After several postponements, the national jamboree of the union started in September. However, it was suspended without electing the leadership following a dispute over the selection of convention representatives and whether or not set up an age bar for the leadership.With no sign for the resumption of the convention, a team of party’s student leaders, led by vice-chair Keshab Rawal, staged a hunger strike demanding the national gathering be held in December second week and leadership elected through a vote. They withdrew their strike with the party leadership agreeing to hold the convention starting on December 8. However, the party meeting led by chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal decided to defer the convention citing lack of preparations due to the need for the party to focus on local by-polls.The next Standing Committee meeting called for December 12 will take a decision regarding its student wing’s convention, according to party leaders.The student leaders, however, seem unconvinced. Rawal, who also is a contender for the union’s presidency, accused the party leadership of treating students as their slaves, who must obey them without question.“This is not just interference in student affairs, it shows they see us as slaves,” Rawal told the Post. “This is unacceptable. I don’t believe the party’s next meeting will announce the date. I will stage a protest again.” Though the party has cited lack of preparation for the postponement, insiders suggest that Dahal is worried because his chosen candidate may not win the elections. “The second rung leaders do not agree with Dahal’s selection. Dahal is avoiding election because he fears his candidate might lose,” said a party leader. Around a dozen student leaders backed by different factions within the party are in the race for the union’s presidency. Party’s senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha supports Pawan Karki. Karki had been running a parallel organisation within the union after Dahal picked Pancha Singh as chair two years back. Barshaman Pun is pushing for Dipesh Pun or Tukman Mahara and Janardan Sharma wants Madan Bhul or Narayan Khanal. Both the leaders are deputy general secretaries in the Maoist Centre.Naresh Regmi has the backing of Pampha Bhusal and Dev Gurung, the party’s vice-chair and general secretary, respectively. Although Dahal hasn’t openly endorsed any candidate, he reportedly has a soft corner for Regmi. By supporting Regmi ahead, Dahal wants to please Bhusal and Gurung to garner their support to induct Netra Bikram Chand, who had earlier splintered from the Maoist Centre, in the party. But deputy general secretaries Pun and Sharma reportedly do not want Chand in the party.The deputy general secretaries, though they are rivals, have started coming together when it comes to challenging Dahal’s leadership. “They feel that Dahal is imposing his decision by dividing them. It is clear that Pun and Sharma will not accept Dahal’s candidate for the union’s chairperson. They might even field a common candidate to counter Dahal’s candidate if voting takes place,” said the leader. “Defeat of Dahal’s candidate would mean he is losing grip on the party organisation.”Some of the student leaders, however, believe the December 12 meeting would take a decision regarding the convention. “I believe the party will either decide to hold voting or will handpick the leadership,” said Regmi.For years, the Maoist Centre’s leadership has directly selected the leadership of its student union. As many as 2,323 representatives were handpicked for the national gathering in September.However, a section of the leaders raised questions over the legality of around 70 representatives, most of whom are enrolled to various institutions under the Council for Vocational Education and Training. The dissident group argues that these representatives were handpicked without following the proper selection process.The differences escalated to the extent where representatives smashed the furniture at the Kirtipur venue of the convention twice as they clashed. A group of student leaders, taking cue from Mahara, the son of Jokh Bahadur Mahara, former Lumbini chief minister, even brandished a khukuri (Gurkha knife). A large number of police personnel were deployed at the Tribhuvan University campus to contain the protest.Right from the commencement of the conference, there were strong calls to impose an age limit for student leaders. But not everyone agreed to that. Without consensus, the issue was to be decided through voting. However, the voting didn’t take place due to the lack of agreement over the representatives leading to the convention’s postponement. \nCricket fans can gear up for an exciting day in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) on Friday as two thrilling matches are lined up at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground in Kirtipur.The day begins at 9:15 am with Karnali Yaks, led by marquee player and captain Sompal Kami, battling against the Chitwan Rhinos, captained by Kushal Malla. Karnali boasts an impressive lineup, including stars like Paul Stirling, Babar Hayat, and Zeeshan Maqsood, alongside emerging talents like Gulshan Kumar Jha and Dev Khanal.The Rhinos, meanwhile, bring a mix of experience and firepower, featuring international players like Sohail Tanvir, Ravi Bopara, and Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton. With both teams eager to dominate, this match promises to set the tone for the day.The second clash at 1:15 pm sees the Lumbini Lions, captained by Rohit Kumar Paudel, taking on the Pokhara Avengers, led by Kushal Bhurtel. The Lions’ squad includes foreign stars such as Ben Cutting and Ramon Simmonds, supported by young talents like Bibek Yadav and Sundeep Jora.The Avengers will rely on their marquee player Bhurtel and international players like Bas de Leede, Matt Critchley, and Michael Leask to turn the game in their favour. Both teams are aiming to climb the league standings with a win in this encounter.With stakes high and talented squads in action, Friday’s matches are set to offer thrilling moments for cricket enthusiasts and could significantly impact the league’s playoff race. \nJanakpur Bolts continued their dominant run, securing their third consecutive victory with a seven-wicket win over Pokhara Avengers in the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL), at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Thursday.Chasing a modest target of 139 runs set by Pokhara, Janakpur reached their goal in just 17.1 overs at the loss of three wickets. Lahiru Milantha led the charge with a quick-fire 45 runs off 32 balls, including eight boundaries. Supporting him, Aasif Sheikh scored 33 off 34 balls, while James Neesham and Harsh Thaker remained unbeaten on 40 and 13 runs respectively.For Pokhara, bowlers Bipin Khatri, Michael Leask, and Kushal Bhurtel claimed one wicket each.Earlier, after electing to bat first, Pokhara managed a total of 138/7 in their allotted 20 overs. Matthew Cross top-scored with 35 runs off 30 balls, including three fours and a six, before being caught off Lalit Rajbanshi's bowling. Michael Leask added a brisk 25 runs off 12 balls but was dismissed by Kishore Mahato.The Pokhara innings faced consistent setbacks, losing wickets at regular intervals. Dinesh Kharel and Andres Ghosh, the openers, were dismissed for 10 and 16 runs, respectively. Rameon Reifer contributed 17 runs before being caught out off James Neesham.For Janakpur, Lalit Rajbanshi was the pick of the bowlers, taking three wickets for 31 runs in his four overs. James Neesham claimed two wickets, while Mohammad Mohsin and Kishore Mahato took one wicket each.This victory places Janakpur at the top of the table with six points, maintaining their unbeaten streak in the tournament. In contrast, Pokhara’s struggles continued as they succumbed to their second consecutive defeat.Later today, Sudurpaschim Royals will face Kathmandu Gurkhas in the second match of the day, scheduled to begin at 1 pm. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has returned home following a four-day official visit to China. He arrived at Tribhuvan International Airport on Thursday afternoon.The Prime Minister was seen off at Beijing Capital International Airport by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong. Oli had travelled to Beijing on December 2 at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang, leading a Nepali delegation.During his stay in Beijing, Prime Minister Oli met Chinese President Xi Jinping, where discussions focused on Nepal-China relations, mutual interests, and areas of bilateral cooperation. Several agreements were signed in the presence of Prime Ministers Oli and Li.Among the agreements signed were a memorandum for the construction of the Tokha-Chahare tunnel road and another to enhance Nepal-China trade. The Chinese government also handed over certification for the completion of the reconstruction of the iconic Basantapur-based Nine-Storey Palace in Kathmandu.Additionally, an agreement was reached on the export of buffalo meat to China, along with development projects, economic and technical cooperation, and cash assistance. Other significant agreements included the deployment of volunteer Chinese language teachers and a collaboration between Nepal Television and China Media Group on communication technology.Both nations also discussed promoting tourism, aiming to attract a significant number of Chinese tourists to Nepal by 2025. Furthermore, Prime Minister Oli extended an invitation to the Chinese Premier Li to visit Nepal.The Nepali delegation accompanying Oli included his spouse Radhika Shakya, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, prime minister's chief advisor Bishnu Prasad Rimal, economic and development advisor Yubaraj Khatiwada, parliamentarians, senior government officials, private sector representatives, and journalists. \nSudurpaschim Royals set a target of 168 runs for Kathmandu Gurkhas in their second match of the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL) at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Thursday.Electing to bowl first after winning the toss, Kathmandu restricted Sudurpaschim to 167 runs at the loss of six wickets in the allotted 20 overs.Sudurpaschim’s batting was led by Brandon McMullen, who scored a quick 53 off 31 balls, including three fours and four sixes. He partnered with Binod Bhandari (35 off 30 balls) for an 86-run stand for the second wicket before being caught off the bowling of Gerhard Erasmus.Skipper Dipendra Singh Airee contributed a vital 43 off 25 balls, hitting three fours and two sixes, before being caught by Michael Levitt off Karan KC’s delivery.Kathmandu’s bowlers were led by Rashid Khan, who picked up two wickets, while Karan KC, Sahab Alam, and Gerhard Erasmus claimed a wicket each.Kathmandu will need a strong batting performance to chase the 168-run target and secure their second victory in the tournament.In their respective opening matches, Sudurpaschim defeated Biratnagar Kings by 90 runs, while Kathmandu overcame Karnali Yaks by three wickets. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nThe dispute between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Janamat Party has escalated as they engage in public accusations against each other through statements.For months, the party has been trying to remove its lawmaker Goma Labh Sapkota from the position claiming she was involved in an irregularity. The Madhesh-based party has been writing to the parliament secretariat and Speaker Devraj Ghimire urging them to remove Sapkota as a member of the lower house.In November first week, the party wrote to Ghimire for the third time claiming she needs to be sacked as a lawmaker alleging that she had received bribes from a contractor and was also conspiring to split the party. Ghimire on November 21 turned down the request arguing the charges the party has leveled against Sapkota don’t lead to her disqualification for the lawmaker post.He said the Political Parties Act has prescribed the conditions when a lawmaker loses his/her position, but the allegations against her don't fall under the conditions.Angered with the decision, the CK Raut-led party not only accused Ghimire of engaging in “criminal conduct” but also claimed that his decision was racist and reeked of bigotry. Issuing a press statement on Monday, it said the decision to continue Sapkota’s position was discriminatory and against the parliamentary norms.“By invalidating the party's disciplinary action, the Parliament Secretariat not only violated the party’s supremacy but also, by acting as a partisan of a particular party, went beyond its jurisdiction, engaging in unlawful, unconstitutional, and criminal acts that jeopardise the multi-party parliamentary system and democracy itself,” the Janamat Party’s statement reads. “If the Speaker is allowed to act beyond his jurisdiction with such arbitrary power, it will set a dangerous precedent and pose a significant threat to democracy.”The party also accused Ghimire of not taking action against Sapkota because she is his relative and had committed to joining the CPN-UML (after splitting the party). Ghimire was elected as the Speaker from the UML.Just because someone is a relative of the Speaker or has pledged to join the Speaker’s former party, he cannot defend a lawmaker even though the party’s central committee has taken action against her following all due legal process, the statement further reads.Further alleging Ghimire, the party claimed that the Speaker has been demonstrating extreme racist and discriminatory behavior in the past, especially regarding issues like the use of language and attire in Parliament, in allocating time and in other parliamentary proceedings.A day later, on Tuesday, the parliament secretariat issued a statement taking a serious exception to the party’s allegation against the Speaker. Through the statement, Anant Prasad Koirala, assistant spokesperson at the secretariat, rubbished the allegations claiming that there has been no discrimination on the grounds of caste, ethnicity, colour, gender, community, language, religion, or physical condition.He said the party requested for Sapkota dismissal as a lawmaker citing in accordance with the Section 35(2) of the Political Parties Act but the allegations aren’t in line with the prescribed conditions for the lawmaker’s dismissal.“The federal parliament secretariat, upon receiving the letter, presented the matter in accordance with the provisions of Nepal’s Constitution and relevant laws (the House of Representatives Rules, 2079 and the Political Parties Act, 2073), and the Speaker has made a decision in accordance with the law,” the Secretariat’s statement said. “The secretariat wants to inform that all the details of the Speaker’s decision are clear and, as always, will ensure that all actions are carried out in accordance with the law.”Sapkota has been refuting the allegations of corruption and conspiring against the party. She has claimed that she is being targetted because she didn’t appoint her personal assistant as dictated by her party leadership. \nOn December 1, when by-elections were underway for 41 vacant local level positions across 32 districts in seven provinces, Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) President Rajendra Lingden claimed that his party could win big in the next general elections, citing growing public disenchantment with the big political parties.Speaking at the inauguration of the party’s municipal convention in Birtamod, Jhapa President Lingden said, “There is no alternative to the RPP in Nepal, and the party should move forward accordingly.” However, when the complete results of the by-elections came on December 2, the RPP failed to win any of the contested posts. It could secure only 26 votes in the election for chair in ward 6 of Kankai Municipality in Jhapa, also Lingden’s hometown. Similarly, in the election for chair in ward 5 of Molung Rural Municipality in Okhaldhunga, the hometown of the party’s general secretary, Rajendra Gurung, the RPP garnered just three votes. However, the party spokesperson Mohan Shrestha later claimed that Lingden’s December 1 remarks referred to the 2027 general elections, not Sunday’s by-elections.But not all RPP leaders agree with Shrestha. Although some of them admit that the RPP’s agenda is drawing public interest, they blame the by-election losses on the party’s poor strategy and call for introspection. “When smaller parties, like the CPN (Unified Socialist) and Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party managed to win local unit positions, the RPP, the fifth largest party in the House of Representatives, failed to attract public support,” an RPP leader said talking to the Post.The party’s poor show has prompted some leaders to question Lingden’s leadership.“The candidates for the by-polls were selected without a formal discussion in the party,” said one of the party leaders requesting anonymity. “It is the failure of the party chief, and he should take responsibility for the setbacks.” The leader also said the party had performed poorly in the last year’s by-elections for federal and provincial positions.Party spokesperson Shrestha, however, dismisses these claims and allegations, arguing that the party did not lose any local level seats it previously held. “There is no question of the party chief taking responsibility for the outcome,” he said, talking to the Post. Some party leaders, however, allege that Lingden’s arbitrary decisions have caused setbacks for the party on many occasions. They say that Lingden did bring changes during the 2021 general convention, but he has failed to maintain the decorum of a party chief.Lately, internal strife has also intensified within the party. In October, while party general secretary Dhawal Shamsher Rana was undergoing treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, India, Lingden removed him as head of the organisation department and replaced him with senior leader Buddhiman Tamang. Also, Lingden has changed the responsibilities of other senior leaders during the same period. “The party chief’s decision to replace the organisation department chief is tied to the party’s poor show in the by-polls,” a dissident in the party told the Post. The party’s another spokesperson, Sagun Lawoti, thinks the RPP should analyse the by-election results thoroughly. “It is high time the party introspected its strategy,” Lawoti said. Political analysts, meanwhile, say that the RPP's failure in byelections reflects the public’s lack of support for its agenda of reinstating Hindu kingdom. “RPP is clinging to a redundant agenda which has no traction with the people,” Mumaram Khanal, a left-leaning political analyst, said.Below is the RPP’s vote tallies in Sunday’s by-elections, according to the Election Commission website: \nAs the vote counting of the by-elections conducted to elect 41 local representatives is about to be completed, the Nepali Congress, the country’s largest party, has won the most seats. Still, the party will be far from happy. Nepali Congress candidates had, in 2022 local elections, won 29 of the 44 seats that had later gone vacant due to the deaths of the incumbents and other reasons. In the by-polls to fill these seats, the Congress is in line to win just 17 seats. The Congress won the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, and 16 ward chairs while it had won 29 posts in earlier elections. In the recent by-elections, the Congress had already won the two posts of district coordinating committees in Kailali and Okhaldhunga unopposed as no one filed candidacy against them.Retaining the mayor of Kirtipur has come as a big relief for the party.Both the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), the second and third largest parties in the federal parliament, respectively, have succeeded in adding to the number of their local representatives. Of the vacant seats, each won seven in 2022. Compared to last time, while the UML added three local representatives, the Maoist Centre added two. Congress General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma, who led the party’s by-poll campaign, said the results were different this time as the party contested the by-elections without any alliance. In the previous local polls, it had formed alliances with the Maoist Centre and CPN (Unified Socialist), among other fringe parties. “Although it seems that we lost some posts we had earlier won, the party members are in fact excited about the election results that we achieved with our own strength,” Sharma told the Post. The by-elections were held for one municipal mayor, two rural municipality chairpersons, four vice-chairs, one deputy mayor, and 33 ward chairs. Among these, the Congress had earlier won the post of Mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, and deputy mayor of Nalgad Municipality of Jajarkot.Likewise, it had won Gramthan Rural Municipality chairperson in Morang, Mahabu Rural Municipality chairperson in Dailekh, vice-chairperson of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality, Dolakha, and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura.Meanwhile, Maoist Centre candidates won vice-chairs in Sarkegad Rural Municipality and Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality. The Congress couldn’t retain at least 10 posts the party earlier won.The Maoists have now snatched away from the Congress Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang and Nalgad deputy mayor in Jajarkot. Likewise, the UML has won Mahabu Rural Municipality and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality.The UML has managed to retain its seven ward chairpersons but in different local units, and add a chairperson and two vice-chairpersons of rural municipalities. According to the Election Commission, UML candidate Jung Bahadur Shahi has won the post of chairman of Mahabu Rural Municipality in Dailekh.Similarly, Maoist Centre’s Namo Narayan Majhi has won the post of chairman of Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang.Maoist Centre’s Devaka Lamichhane has been elected as deputy mayor of Nalgad Rural Municipality in Jajarkot.Likewise, Sulochana Kumari Bhandari of the UML has won the post of Vice-Chairperson of Balmiki Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura. Her nearest rival was Pultisara Shahi of the Congress. Bhandari was earlier defeated by Maina Devi Joshi of the Nepali Congress in the 2022 local elections.The Maoist Centre did well in some places where local by-elections were held. Despite the Congress-UML alliance, the Maoist Centre won the post of vice-chair of Putha Uttarganga in Rukum (East). The Maoist Centre’s candidate Narapura Budha won the post securing 3,627 votes to defeat Kesh Kumari Tulachan of the UML who was backed by the Congress. The UML candidate Tulachan got only 2,128 votes. In the by-polls, the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party (NMKP) candidate won the post of chairperson in ward 4 of Tilagupha Municipality in Kalikot. The party’s Khadgaraj Shahi won the post with 143 votes, defeating Naishoba Shahi of CPN (Maoist Centre), who garnered 115 votes. The post was earlier held by the Maoist Centre. Besides Bhaktapur, the party also has a presence in places like Kalikot, Humla and Dailekh. The party also has ward chairpersons in some places of Dailekh.“Our party played a big role in raising political awareness in places like Kalikot, Humla and Dailekh even during the Panchayat period,” Prem Suwal, the federal lawmaker from the party, told the Post. Among the new parties that emerged in the November 2022 elections, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) won the post of chairperson of ward 16 of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC).RSP’s Rojina Shrestha left the candidates of traditional parties behind. The post was earlier held by the Congress. Despite the party’s poor performance in other parts of the country where the by-polls were conducted, Shrestha’s win in KMC-16 marks the party’s debut at the local level. Shrestha secured 2,902 votes against UML’s Laxmi Ratna Tuladhar who garnered 2,220 votes. The Congress candidate Devendra Pathak managed to secure 2,214 votes in the ward.The Maoist Centre had not fielded a candidate in ward 16 of KMC. Asked why the Congress candidate lost, the party’s vice president of Kathmandu unit, Santa Kumar Maharjan, said the ward was never a Congress stronghold.“This was a ward dominated by the UML earlier as well. When all ward members were from the UML, Mukunda Risal was the only candidate to be elected from the Congress. He became the chairperson,” Maharjan said. “Risal’s victory could solely be attributed to his charismatic leadership.”Except the RSP, other new political parties failed to win any seats. The Janamat Party, which has a strong presence in Madhesh Province and currently leads the Madhesh Province government, failed to show its presence at the local level by-polls. In the by-polls held for the post of ward chairperson in seven wards in Madhesh, the Congress and the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal led by Upendra Yadav won two posts each. The UML, the Maoist Centre and the CPN (Unified Socialist) one post each. Professor of Political Science Krishna Khanal, says that aversion to political parties played a role in this by-election. “You could say those who won in these by-elections achieved technical victories. Based on these by-polls, none of the parties can claim to have increased their internal strength,” Khanal said.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who reached Beijing on Monday on a four-day official visit, is set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Qiang on Tuesday. Following the meetings, several project agreements and instruments are expected to be signed, officials said.Sun Weidong, vice minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Nepali Ambassador to China Krishna Prasad Oli, and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song, among others, welcomed the Nepali delegation at Beijing Capital International Airport. Oli is leading an 87-member delegation that includes his spouse Radhika Shkaya, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, advisors to the prime minister, members of parliament, senior government officials, and businesspersons, among others.“Prime Minister Oli will hold a meeting with Xi, the president of the People’s Republic of China tomorrow [Tuesday],” said a statement issued by the Nepali Embassy in Beijing on Monday. “On the same day, the prime minister is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Li.”A Cabinet meeting on Sunday approved the prime minister’s visit to China, as well as projects and instruments to be signed during the visit. Besides meeting with the Chinese president and premier, Oli will hold talks with Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and will deliver a keynote address at Peking University. He will also address the Nepal-China Business Forum, jointly hosted by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), on Wednesday.Sunday’s Cabinet meeting also approved the signing of a memorandum of understanding on the Volunteers’ Chinese Language Teachers’ Programme, according to Minister for Information and Communication Prithivi Subba Gurung, the government spokesman. The MoU will pave the way for Chinese teachers to teach Chinese language in various Nepali schools. Details of the programme, such as the number of Chinese teachers and working modality, will be finalised by the Ministry of Education and its Chinese counterpart, according to a foreign ministry official.China is set to provide a one-time budgetary support of $20 million to Nepal. Another agreement to accept Chinese economic and technical assistance worth 300 million RMB was also endorsed by the Cabinet on Sunday.Observers are closely watching whether the framework for cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be signed during this visit. A revised BRI framework document, prepared by a four-member task force from the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, has already been forwarded to the Chinese side for its consideration. Although Nepal has received positive signals on the revised BRI document, it remains uncertain whether it will be signed during Oli’s visit, a foreign ministry official told the Post before flying to Beijing on Monday.During the visit, according to government spokesperson Gurung, some project-related agreements are also expected to be signed. These include construction of an integrated check post at the Korola border point; Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road; Tokha-Chhahre-Bidur Highway; and an agreement to complete the feasibility study of 220KV Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime cross-border power transmission line.According to Gurung, 0ther agreements include the construction of a friendship bridge in Kimathanka— Khandbari over the Arun river; construction of a multi-functional agriculture park at Chobhar; industrial park at the Korola border point; and agreement on commencing bone marrow transplant at BP Koirala Cancer Hospital. Also, a new development cooperation model for 2024–2028 between Nepal and China is also expected to be signed. During the visit, leaders and officials will engage in finalising the framework for BRI cooperation and some projects to be developed under it. The Nepali side has proposed a dozen projects to be executed under the BRI framework. Multiple officials involved in the negotiations with the Chinese told the Post that Nepal is seeking the release of pending grants announced by China since 2008 and wants to develop select projects.Similarly, an MoU will be signed between Nepal Television and China Media Group, which owns China Central Television (including China Global Television Network), China National Radio, and China Radio International.Some accords and agreements from previous visits including Araniko Highway upgrade, and the second phase of Kathmandu Ring Road expansion are likely to be signed after delegation-level talks between Oli and Li on Tuesday. Chinese assistance, including 100 electric vehicles, vans, and ambulances; and some cross-border infrastructure and connectivity-related projects, will also be discussed and signed during the prime minister’s visit, according to officials. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nThe Golden Thali, located within the Thamel Eco Resort premises in Thamel’s tourist hub, has been inaugurated.Initiated by tourism entrepreneurs Rajan Simkhada of Earthbound Expeditions and Mohan Lamsal of Makalu Adventures, in collaboration with the Chef Nepal team, the restaurant aims to serve authentic Nepali flavours. Designed to promote and showcase the cuisine of mid-hill regions of Nepal, Golden Thali represents the country’s diverse culinary heritage, according to the owners. The Golden Thali includes chutneys prepared using a traditional stone grinder, fermented pickles, fresh pickles, and more. All spices used in the thali are prepared on a stone grinder to ensure authentic flavours. The Golden Thali features 15 dishes, including meat and various other delicacies. Unlike other typical Thali restaurants in Nepal, the Golden Thali offers choices and customisation options.Customers can select from various lentils, including black, red, beans, and mixed lentils. Similarly, for the traditional dhido, options such as corn, wheat, or buckwheat are available. \nThe British College has announced its official approval as a Recognised Teaching Centre for the University of London’s MSc Professional Accountancy programme.This significant achievement underscores the college’s commitment to offering world-class education in professional accountancy and solidifies its standing as a premier institution in Nepal, the college said in a statement. In collaboration with The British Professional College, a Platinum Approved Learning Partner of ACCA, British College will now offer students the opportunity to pursue MSc professional accountancy. Prof. Mary Bishop, Executive Principal of The British College, stated: “This master’s programme offers a distinctive opportunity for aspiring accountants to obtain a comprehensive qualification that seamlessly integrates both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. It provides an advanced understanding of financial management, strategic decision-making, and professional ethics, equipping students to thrive in the competitive global marketplace.” \nDuring Covid, many farmers in western Nepal suffered a severe fertiliser shortage, and crossing to India over porous border points to bring them was fully restricted. A couple in Rupandehi made up their minds—to open an organic fertiliser plant.Months after the plan, Siddhartha Agrawal and Poonam Kumari opened a Grow More Fertiliser and Chemical plant in Kothawa of Rohini rural municipality-4. “We started producing and distributing Ratnam granulated organic fertiliser. It’s the first granulated organic fertiliser produced in Nepal,” said Siddhartha. “It’s the best fertiliser for the soil as it contains a balanced quantity of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, magnesium, iron, boron, and calcium, etc.”The company has invested Rs300 million in the plant spread over five bighas. The company aims to supply fertiliser to farmers' doorsteps.Farmers feel relieved as the production starts arriving in the market.“There is a mix of all materials essential to maintain soil health, as tests have proven. We believe using fertiliser helps grow agricultural output,” said Siddhartha.The investment comes as factories in the district are shutting down due to an economic slowdown. The factory initially targeted to supply fertiliser in Lumbini, Gandaki, Bagmati, and Madhesh provinces.“The factory’s production capacity is 200 tonnes daily. We will ramp up the capacity based on the market demand,” said Siddhartha, adding that the factory has been distributing the fertiliser by opening sales depots in more than 100 locations in the provinces.The factory has obtained production permits from the Lumbini provincial Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.Managing Director Poonam Kumari said they were motivated to open a fertiliser factory after observing a severe scarcity during the Covid pandemic.“After that, we started construction.”She said it took them a year to get government approval. “It took another year to test the fertiliser—it’s impact on plant growth,” she said. After the successful test, the production and supply began.The fertiliser targets vegetable cultivation—both rooftop and terrace farming. It can also be applied to paddy, wheat and maize, besides legumes like lentils.It is also suitable for cash crops like sugarcane and tea, said Poonam Kumari.The fertiliser is available in 5 kg, 25 kg and 50 kg packages. Multiple factors are behind the shortage of chemical fertilisers in Nepal—from lean inventories and poor supply mechanisms to faulty policies and international pricing factors. These cause chronic distress to the tens of thousands of farmers annually who face other risks like droughts, floods, and crop failure.Agriculture is the mainstay of Nepal's economy, employing around 60 percent of the total workforce and contributing 24 percent to the national economy.The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development has estimated that the annual demand for fertilisers stands at around 700,000 tonnes.However, the estimate is years old, and there has been no study to find the actual demand.A separate report by USAID, an international development agency, has shown that Nepal is highly dependent on smuggled fertilisers and estimates that nearly 70 percent of the 600,000 to 800,000 tonnes of the plant nutrients are improperly imported.An agricultural country, Nepal depends on fertiliser produced in other countries. “Not only that, farmers have to wait in long queues all day to get a bag of fertiliser,” said Siddhartha. “Nepal has been spending billions on fertiliser imports.”He hopes their output will be able to meet a sizeable market demand in the future.He said that compared to chemical fertiliser, Ratnam is cheaper and of more quality. “Our target is to replace chemical fertilisers gradually. Our production is getting huge demand from local farmers and even those in India.”A 50 kg diammonium phosphate (DAP) bag costs around Rs2,400 while Ratnam is priced at Rs1,200. “This is why we are requesting all to use Ratnam,” said Poonam Kumari.The factory currently employs 40 people. \nThe owner of a food stall in Vũng Tàu City in southern Việt Nam has been fined VNĐ125 million (US$4,900) and will have to suspend their operations for five months, in the wake of a massive food poisoning incident linked to the stall that affected over 340 individuals were affected by food poisoning, including one death.According to Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province’s authorities, the owner of bánh mì shop Cô Ba on Nguyễn An Ninh Street in Ward 7 was found guilty of several violations, including selling contaminated food and failing to meet food safety standards.On November 26, multiple customers who purchased bread from the bakery reported symptoms such as stomach pain, dizziness, nausea, and diarrhoea, including a 71-year-old man who tragically succumbed after consuming the food.The affected patrons were treated at local hospitals, and all have since stabilised and been discharged, according to local authorities.According to investigations, the food poisoning was caused by contaminated pork products and raw vegetables infected with Salmonella and E. coli bacteria.Food safety remains a pressing concern in Việt Nam, particularly among street food vendors who frequently flout hygiene regulations.In a similar incident last year, a popular bánh mì shop in Hội An town in the central province of Quảng Nam was heavily fined and suspended after over 300 individuals fell ill from consuming its bread, though no fatalities were reported.-In Association with ANN \nEminent city doctors and health experts today gave a call for caution, mass awareness and improved government policies to minimise the use of microplastics that can cause several health hazards, including cancer.Tiny plastic particles that are less than 5 mm are called microplastics and are being attributed to severe respiratory diseases or even some types of cancer. According to Dr Monidipa Mondal, an eminent radiation oncologist, when microplastics enter the body through food or other sources, they first encounter the immune cells. “Being micro-mini in size, they can easily enter the immune cells after which a biochemical agent called cyclophane is released. The cyclophanes prepare chronic information inside the cells. “As we know if chronic information continues to get stored in the cells, it can lead to cancer. Apart from this, cancer is also related to free radicals. Therefore, it also creates oxidative stress in the cells and free radicals in the cells due to which cell multiplication occurs,” informed the doctor.As reiterated by Dr Mondal, recent studies have revealed an increased number of colorectal cancers among people. “It has been found in some studies that microplastics could be a possible driver of colorectal cancer. Another observation reveals a link between breast cancer and microplastic. We have also heard about BPA-free plastic. BPA or Bisphenol-A is an agent that can mimic estrogen. In some cancer cases, estrogen has been found. It can, therefore, be said that if it can mimic estrogen, it could also be a possible cause of breast cancer,” she added.According to research by India Clean Air Network (India CAN), degraded plastic from waste and wastewater discharge due to inefficient treatment processes are two of the major sources of microplastics in West Bengal entering the human body in various ways. The health experts recommended stronger and improved government policies to curb the menace of plastic. As pointed out by Professor Sadhan K Ghosh, mass awareness, particularly among young students is the need of the hour. “The first need is waste segregation. Second, the governance should be such that microplastics are not created for which legislation and its implementation must be done. Also, as plastic becomes brittle and enters our body while swimming or is even consumed by fish that we eat, littering sea beaches should be prohibited,” pointed out the professor.-In Association with ANN \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has started providing ultrasound services free of cost to needy patients from its urban health promotion centres.Officials at the health department of the city office said that 10 out of 32 urban health promotion centres have already started providing services, and an additional five will also start the services within a month.“Any patient from any part of the country, if they are in Kathmandu metropolis, can receive the service,” said Deepak Kumar KC, chief of the health department of the metropolis. “We do not charge anyone any amount.”KMC officials said that ultrasound is a free basic health service the city office is committed to providing. However, patients must pay at least Rs400 for the services in the big hospitals and private clinics and hospitals charge additional amounts.Doctors recommend patients an ultrasound for various diagnoses, including finding the cause of pain and swelling, monitoring the growth and development of the fetus, and looking for blockages, among others.Officials say patients can bring prescriptions from other hospitals or doctors at urban health promotion centres for services.Along with ultrasound service, the city office has been providing physiotherapy services free of cost from all its 32 urban health promotion centres.The metropolis has also been working on setting up laboratories in all of its 32 urban health promotion centres.KC said that due to the lack of laboratory services in most urban health clinics, patients have been forced to seek services at state-run hospitals and private centres, which are often overcrowded and expensive. According to him, lab services will also be free to the patients.The city office runs 32 urban health promotion centres, one in each ward of the metropolis. The metropolis had recently opened vacancies to hire 108 staffers, including 32 physiotherapists, 29 lab technicians, four medical officers, five staff nurses, 10 radiographers, 10 pharmacy assistants, and 26 peons for the urban health clinics.The city office provides 98 types of essential medicines—for communicable and non-communicable diseases, including high blood pressure, diabetes, mental health, heart disease, asthma, cholesterol, and respiratory problems—free of cost.Patients with government health insurance can get over 300 types of medicines from urban health clinics, according to health officials.Earlier, KMC provided mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics at urban health promotion centres. Officials hoped the move would help hundreds of mental health patients in the city get timely treatment.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Although neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that many residents could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems including anxiety and depression, among others.Health workers say that many city residents, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination, and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not openly discuss their mental health issues.The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Currently, we have medical doctors in all 32 urban health promotion centres,” said Dr Dibas Neupane of the metropolis. “We have been working to make our health service more effective.”The city office has also started campaigns in its jurisdiction to raise awareness of health hazards. The health department has started deploying health workers in various wards to examine sugar, blood pressure, and kidney function. “We have prepared a calendar for the health campaign every month,” said Neupane. “Health workers will visit the densely populated areas at least eight days a month to examine the health condition of locals. We hope that campaigns will help make people aware of their health and inspire behaviour change.” \nDespite winter's arrival, dengue continues to spread in Nepal, with over 34,000 cases and 13 fatalities since January, putting an emphasis on prevention and early treatment.\nNepal Foods received the Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International for its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.\nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a five-day trout festival showcasing 12 unique dishes from various cuisines, celebrating the nutritional benefits of trout from Nepal's rivers and lakes.\nGrowing up in Nepal, the author's fascination with baking led to a series of mishaps involving an improvised chocolate cake and misidentified leavening agents, which later prompted a journey of research, trial-and-error, and an understanding of baking science and techniques.\nQueer individuals have historically faced discrimination and marginalization, but safe spaces like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu, founded after the Stonewall Riots, provide acceptance and a sense of belonging for the LGBTQIA+ community, promoting inclusivity and understanding within society.\nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York, established 'The Sewing Tin' supper club to promote Nepali cuisine while blending Nepali flavors with modern culinary techniques, showcasing his signature 'Confit Duck Chatamari'.\nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nIn a commanding performance at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, Sudurpaschim Royals emerged victorious over Kathmandu Gurkhas by 73 runs in their second match of the Nepal Premier League (NPL).After being called to bat, Sudurpaschim set a target of 168 runs with a score of 167/6 in their allotted 20 overs. Skipper Dipendra Singh Airee played a pivotal role, smashing 43 runs off just 25 balls, including three fours and two sixes. Brandon McMullen also impressed, scoring a brisk 53 from 36 balls, featuring three fours and four sixes. Binod Bhandari contributed a solid 35 off 28 balls, forming a crucial 86-run partnership with McMullen for the second wicket.Kathmandu Gurkhas’ chase got off to a shaky start, losing key wickets quickly. Naren Saud, who had just returned from the ACC U-19 Asia Cup in the UAE, delivered a match-winning performance with figures of 5/19 from 3.5 overs. His outstanding spell included four wickets in just 11 balls. Abinash Bohara also bowled economically, taking 2/12 from three overs, while McMullen and Saif Zaib each picked up a wicket.The Gurkhas were bowled out for 94 in 15.5 overs, with Stephen Eskinazi top-scoring with 37 runs from 35 balls, including five fours and one six. Other contributors included Sumit Maharjan (14), Bhim Sharki and Gerhard Erasmus, who each made 10. The rest of the lineup, including Michael Levitt (5), Shankar Rana (3), and Rashid Khan (2), struggled to build partnerships.Rashid Khan led the Gurkhas’ bowling with figures of 2/20 from four overs, while Karan KC, Shahab Alam, and Erasmus claimed one wicket each.Sudurpaschim Royals’ win follows their impressive 90-run victory over Biratnagar Kings in their opening match, while Kathmandu Gurkhas had previously secured a three-wicket win against Karnali Yaks in their second match. \nSyrian rebels ousted pro-government forces from Hama on Thursday, bringing the insurgents a major new victory after a lightning advance across northern Syria and dealing a new blow to President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies.The Syrian army announced that the rebels had entered Hama after intense clashes and said it was redeploying outside the city “to preserve civilians lives and prevent urban combat.”Rebels said they had taken districts in the city's northeast and had seized the central prison, freeing detainees.Al Jazeera television broadcast what it said were images of rebels inside the city, some of them meeting civilians near a roundabout while others drove in military vehicles and on mopeds.The rebels took the main northern city of Aleppo last week and have since pushed south from their enclave in northwest Syria, reaching a strategic hill just north of Hama on Tuesday and advancing towards the city's east and west flanks on Wednesday.Hama has remained in government hands throughout the civil war, which erupted in 2011 as a rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad. Its fall to a revived insurgency would send shockwaves through Damascus and its Russian and Iranian allies.The city lies more than a third of the way from Aleppo to Damascus and its capture would open the road for a rebel advance on Homs, the main central city that functions as a crossroads connecting Syria’s most populous regions.Inside Hama, the scene of an Islamist uprising that the Assad dynasty crushed in 1982, the internet was cut off and streets emptied on Wednesday according to a resident whose family remain in the city. \nSouth Korean opposition lawmakers said on Thursday they would vote this weekend to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his botched attempt to impose martial law, while the defence minister blamed for recommending the move resigned.Yoon’s declaration of martial law late on Tuesday sought to consolidate power, ban political activity and censor the media in Asia’s fourth-largest economy and a key US ally.It sparked outrage in the streets and concern among South Korea’s international allies.Lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Party planned to seek a vote in parliament to impeach Yoon at about 7 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Saturday, a party spokesperson told reporters.“The Yoon Suk Yeol regime’s declaration of emergency martial law caused great confusion and fear among our people,” Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Seung-won told the National Assembly earlier.Yoon’s ruling People Power Party is divided over the crisis but said it would oppose impeachment with the party in turmoil and two years left in Yoon's five-year term.The Democratic Party needs at least eight of the 108 ruling-party lawmakers to back the bill for it to pass with a two-thirds majority in the 300-seat parliament.Fighting for his political future, Yoon accepted the resignation of Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun on Thursday and nominated his ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Choi Byung-hyuk, as a replacement, Yoon’s office said.Kim had recommended Yoon declare martial law on Tuesday, according to the interior minister, a senior military official and the opposition’s filing to impeach Yoon.Kim also ordered the deployment of troops to the parliament, Vice-Defence Minister Kim Seon-ho said, adding that he was unaware of the martial law order until Yoon declared it.“I have fundamentally opposed the mobilisation of military forces under martial law and have expressed negative opinions about it,” Kim Seon-ho told a parliament hearing on Thursday, apologising and taking responsibility for failing to prevent it.South Korea’s army chief has also offered to resign, the Yonhap news agency said.The former defence minister now faces a travel ban as prosecutors investigate the attempt to impose martial law, broadcaster YTN said. Yoon and the interior minister were also being investigated, Yonhap said.INSTABILITY ALARMSJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Japan’s “security situation may be fundamentally changed” in light of the instability in Seoul and North Korea’s rising military assertiveness.“What will happen to South Korea? There appears to be a great deal of domestic criticism and opposition,” he told parliament, adding that Yoon’s efforts to improve relations with Tokyo “must never be undermined”.There has been no reaction yet from North Korea to the drama in the South.On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Reuters the United States had not been made aware in advance of Yoon’s declaration, while his deputy, Kurt Campbell, said Yoon had badly misjudged it.The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.The commander of US Forces-Korea, General Paul LaCamera, warned American troops to stay vigilant, avoid areas with protests, and tell superiors of travel plans in case “something unexpected” happens.Yoon had been embraced by leaders in the West as a partner in the US-led effort to unify democracies against growing authoritarianism in China, Russia and elsewhere.But he caused unease among South Koreans by branding his critics “communist totalitarian and anti-state forces”. In November, he denied wrongdoing in response to accusations of influence-peddling against him and his wife and he has taken a hard line against labour unions. \nBitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by sceptics as a coming-of-age for cryptocurrencies as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement cryptos' place in financial markets.The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record just shy of $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple alone is worth about $3.7 trillion.Bitcoin’s march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the concept of “decentralised finance” in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago.Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump’s sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress.Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday’s Asian morning, it was soon above $103,000 and was last fetching $103,335 .“We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital.“Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.”Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.“We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, US investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund.On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission.Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to \"develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms,\" and the Chamber of Digital Commerce.“Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem,” said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith.“We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation.”A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council.PART OF THE LANDSCAPEBitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns.Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed.Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally.US-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election.“Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money,” said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.“Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalised,” he said. “If you fast forward a number of years on trading floors you'll have a sales and trading desk...which will sit alongside FX and rates and commodities.”It is already becoming increasingly financialised, with the launch of bitcoin futures in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock’s ETF in November.Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and exchange operator Coinbase each up around 65% in November.Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies.‘WHO CAN PROHIBIT IT’The cryptocurrency industry has been criticised for its massive energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, and the underlying technology is yet to deliver a major revolution in the way money moves around the globe.Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: “Who can prohibit it? No one.” And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience.“As time goes by it's proving itself as part of the financial landscape,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney.“I find it very hard to value it ... it’s anyone’s guess. But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up.” \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nHindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das, a former member of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) and now a spokesperson of Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote, was arrested on charges of treason upon his arrival at the Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka. This has spiralled into a war of words, threatening to damage the existing bilateral relations between India and Bangladesh.Das was brought to a magistrate court in Chittagong on November 26 and was denied bail. A protest against the decision led to a violent clash between Das’s supporters and law enforcing authorities, where a lawyer named Saiful Islam was hacked to death, ensuing a blame game between the Monk’s supporters and his political opponents. Aftermath of arrestIn a statement by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on November 26, India expressed “deep concern”. It asked the interim regime to “ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities.” However, Bangladesh dismissed India’s concerns, and the country’s foreign ministry referred to India’s statement as “unfounded” and “misrepresented fact”, which stands “contrary to the spirit of friendship and understanding between the two neighbouring countries”. Since then, social media has been rife with nationalistic rhetoric of netizens against one other. Meanwhile, the flags of both countries were desecrated by protestors as if to score a nationalistic point over the other. However, the situation did not end there. As groups within India, supported by regional political leaders, gained ground, the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission office in Agartala was attacked. India issued a statement, describing the attack as “deeply regrettable” and promising action against those breaching the mission’s security. The bank accounts of Das and 17 members of ISKCON have been frozen. Bangladesh’s immigration police didn’t permit 54 group members from ISKCON to cross over to India despite having valid travel documents. There are demands in Bangladesh that ISKCON be declared a terrorist organisation. However, the Bangladesh High Court dismissed an appeal to ban the organisation.Issue of minority safetyAfter the fall of the regime, houses and properties of the minority community were targeted. According to reports, 1,068 homes and business establishments were attacked. There were reports about attacks on temples across the country. A gold-plated silver crown gifted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Jeshoreshwari Kali temple in Bangladesh’s Satkhira district was stolen. India expressed its concerns, and Modi spoke to the interim regime's Chief Adviser, Muhammad Yunus. Yunus visited Dhakeswari temple, assured the minority community of safety, and promised to take action against those who attacked them. But the violence continued. Some Hindus said they took help from their Muslim neighbours to protect themselves. In some cases, people kept vigil to protect temples. Some Bangladeshi politicians justify the event as an attack on “Awami-Hindus” as if they deserved it since they are perceived as supporters of the deposed regime. In 2001, Bangladesh witnessed similar violence by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters when the Awami League lost power to the BNP. Durga puja was celebrated in a lacklustre manner, and 35 puja pandals were attacked. In one of the places, Islamic music was played.As a result, many Hindus wanted to flee to India but were not allowed to cross the border. Such attacks on minorities also occurred during the Awami League period, but the scale of violence this time was massive. While Bangladesh media accused Indian media of “exaggerating”, it was silent on the magnitude of these attacks except for The Daily Star and Prothom Alo, whom the Islamists targeted for their reportage on the attack on minorities.Fallout of the Monk’s arrestSeveral hospitals in Tripura and West Bengal announced they won’t admit patients from Bangladesh. There were protests in Bangladesh against the attack on the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Tripura, so the country decided to close the Commission temporarily. Both countries have stepped up the security of their missions following the security breach in Agartala. Emotions are running high among the people on both sides. Statements by politicians have further fuelled the acrimony.The current relationship is vulnerable to domestic politics on both sides. Since the fall of the Hasina government, anti-Indianism has been influenced by vested interests in Bangladesh, seeking to recast its foreign relations while portraying India as a beneficiary of Hasina’s rule. Despite all these upheavals marked by high expectations, frustration and accusations, India has not accepted the change of regime in Dhaka. There is a new emphasis on the relationship with Pakistan as the interim government announced a re-examination of MoUs and agreements concluded with India. Revival of the SAARC has been proposed, while the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) has disappeared from the political lexicon.Border trade continues as usual, and there is a ray of hope in bilateral relations. The Home Minister of India inaugurated a passenger terminal building on October 27. Ten Bangladesh officers also came to India for Land Port Training under India’s Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme (ITEC) in October. When protestors from India threatened to disrupt trade following Das’s arrest, the Border Security Force and the Land Port Authority of India took measures by shutting the access to the border entry points. A meeting at the Foreign Secretary level is due next week.Bilateral relations are not founded on century-old socio-economic relations but on the reality of geography. Bangladesh remains India’s largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh’s second-largest trading partner after China. The two countries mostly trade essential food items. Moreover, India exports raw materials for Bangladesh’s garment industry, contributing 80 percent of the export earnings, which add up to 11 percent to the country’s GDP. Bangladesh and India must put the relationship back on track and take it forward. Irresponsible comments in the media create an atmosphere of a zero-sum game. This multifaceted relationship cannot be held hostage to any single issue, as India has underlined. It is time to take extreme caution to navigate this complex bilateral relationship as Bangladesh moves towards implementing institutional reforms that would ultimately pave the way for democracy, as aspired by the July uprising that unseated Hasina.  \nPrime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli chose New York as his first visit abroad to attend the 79th United Nations General Assembly. He held a 45-minute-long meeting on the sidelines with his Indian counterpart, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sharma Oli described the talk as ‘positive’. Modi termed it ‘very good’. Shorn of diplomatese, both statements implied that the meeting had failed to restore mutual trust between them.It took Premier Sharma Oli a while to get an invitation from his Chinese counterpart. The agenda of the visit had to be negotiated with the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the Pratinidhi Sabha that is keeping the government afloat. The chattering classes of Kathmandu were excited that Sharma Oli had chosen Beijing over New Delhi as his first official visit. The misplaced enthusiasm is meaningless: Beijing is politically hallowed for communists of all shades just as Banares is sacred for every pious Hindu.In any case, Nepal must be the only country where China and India are considered competitors. The Chinese economy is nearly five times bigger than India’s GDP. The military spending of Beijing is at least three times that of India. Ranked at 75, China is grouped high on the global Human Development Index (HDI) while India with its 134 score falls well below Bhutan and Bangladesh. Beijing and New Delhi aren’t in the same league.Geopolitical strategists in the capital cities of Nepal’s neighbouring countries are more fearful of Washington's intentions than those of each other. For a brief while in the 1950s, the United States worked with Indians to contain China and stop Beijing from spreading its wings in South Asia. Officially, the Ping-Pong diplomacy began in 1971, but a lot of hush-hush preparations must have been done earlier for the sudden thaw in the frozen relations.Once Chairman Mao Zedong shook the hand of President Richard Nixon on February 21, 1972, the balance of power in the world began to change irreversibly. Chairman Mao had found a stepping stone to emerge out of the well of seclusion that he had dug for the Chinese with his disastrous campaigns of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.Awakened dragonUnable to withstand the pressure of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness), the USSR’s downfall began with the fall of the Berlin Wall and gained momentum with the collapse of satellite regimes in East Europe. The greatest political experiment of what historian Eric Hobsbawm has called “the short twentieth century 1914-1991” completely disintegrated with the humiliating ouster of Mikhail Gorbachev. The contested concept of unipolarity did have its brief moment in the sun, but it soon dissolved when Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History? hypothesis was countered by his guru Samuel Huntington’s The Clash of Civilizations? formulation heralding the beginning of a multipolar world of contesting civilisations. Meanwhile, the Paramount Leader of China Deng Xiaoping had already started a modernisation drive in the 1980s with his oft-quoted command: “observe calmly, secure our position, cope with affairs calmly, hide our capacities and bide our time, be good at maintaining a low profile, and never claim leadership.” Exalted with the title of “core leader”, President Xi Jinping has built the structure of global ascendency on the ground that Mao broke with the help of President Nixon in the 1970s. President Deng laid the foundation with the cooperation of President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, and President Jiang Zemin erected a scaffold of export-led growth with the collaboration of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which culminated in China being admitted into the World Trade Organisation.Despite its status of being the technological giant and a military superpower throughout the Cold War, Moscow lacked the economic muscle to challenge the hegemony of Washington that had been institutionalised through the Bretten Wood Sisters—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group—that undergirded the global trade and industry. The legacy of the British Empire had left English as the lingua franca of a large part of the world. It helped establish Hollywood films, British publications and New York fashion as the desirable elements of the upwardly mobile lifestyle of the growing middleclass in the Third World countries. The financial hub had shifted from London to New York. The Silicon Valley in California had emerged as the nucleus of cutting-edge technology. Backed by enormous endowments, the Ivy League institutions were attracting the best and brightest of the world. All that the USSR had to offer in comparison was the theory of the inevitable collapse of capitalism. The Chinese began to grow out of all such illusions in the 1970s and have gone about building an alternative to the plutocratic capitalism of the Washington Consensus with their model of authoritarian capitalism based on the Beijing Consensus.Wounded eaglePresident Xi Jinping’s concept of “building a community with a shared future for mankind” is an outline of an alternative world order. The Chinese designs of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the BRICS grouping that has more members than the acronym can accommodate, the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) are aimed at what has been termed as “Making China Great Again”.Just as unipolarity is an oxymoron, multipolarity is merely a desire of emerging nations for a seat at the high table. Ultimately, they must coalesce around a country with the determination and wherewithal to offer an alternative to the existing world order. Even though the Russians hosted the 16th annual BRICS summit at Kazan, China was the power behind the throne of President Vladimir Putin. President Xi Jinping agreed “in principle to the suggestions made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi” at the summit, which is a signal to the world that India will be careful in future about encircling China on behalf of the US. The collective anxiety of the geopolitical and geoeconomic establishment in the US about the future of their unchallenged dominance for almost a century is understandable. The incoherence in the statements of President Donald Trump probably comes from the confusion of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) team that has little idea about the frustrations of many countries with American hegemony.President Trump was unintelligibly provocative—meaningless covfefe is but one example—in his first term. It seems his second stint is going to be stormier. He is promising punitive tariff hikes. That will hasten the triumph of China-centric and China-inspired Pax Autocratica over Pax Democratica. President Trump appears to be determined to complete the task begun by President Nixon in the 1970s.Premier Sharma Oli’s pilgrimage to Beijing is a sideshow. Chieftains from tributary states are often rewarded for their fidelity, and Sharma Oli is likely to comeback with enough lollipops to silence his critics at home. But Beijing will perhaps be more interested in asking that Kathmandu shift its primary loyalty from Washington to Beijing. Nepal’s diplomatic dilemma will be much more perplexing than occasionally flashing the China card at New Delhi to assert its sovereignty.  \nRecently, a 22-year-old man visited Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) to get his sexually transmitted disease status checked after having unprotected sex. He was to leave abroad for higher education the following day. Likewise, several months ago, a young man expressed his distress over the intense pain following a penicillin injection administered against syphilis disease. When questioned about his marital status, he stated that he only had a girlfriend with whom he maintained a regular consensual sexual relationship. He further mentioned that the sexual interactions were generally unprotected. As per the hospital (STIDH) data, the majority of individuals receiving penicillin injections for syphilis are between 20 and 40 years old, with nearly two-thirds of that group being in the 20 to 30 age range. It’s a surprising but concerning public health concern in Nepal. Unprotected sexual contact not only carries the risk of syphilis but also increases the likelihood of other infectious diseases such as HIV, Mpox (known as “monkeypox”), HPV, gonorrhoea, herpes, chlamydia, trichomoniasis and hepatitis B. Since syphilis does not immediately show severe symptoms, many people do not get tested and thus remain unaware of their infection. There has been a notable rise in youths seeking foreign employment opportunities in recent years. This mandates medical examinations and blood tests, including for sexually transmitted infections/diseases. Following this, information about the spread of syphilis in Nepal has surfaced. People who engage in unprotected sexual activities, especially with more than one partner, have a higher likelihood of contracting syphilis. A bacterium, 'Treponema pallidum', is responsible for the infection. The transmission occurs through vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse as well as during pregnancy and through blood transfusions. Syphilis has four stages. On average, symptoms appear within three weeks of infection. This is referred to as the first stage. Sores may appear on the genitals, vagina, mouth/lips, or anus. As the sores are painless, many do not notice them or tend to overlook them. If treatment is provided around this time, the infection can be prevented from progressing to the second stage. Even without treatment, the sores typically heal within three to six weeks. However, the infection will progress to the second stage. Small rashes can be seen on various body parts (including the palms and soles) a few weeks after the first stage. Since these rashes are not clearly visible or do not cause pain or itching, people usually do not pay attention to them. However, symptoms such as fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat and fatigue can occur. The infection will enter the next stage, known as the 'latent stage' if left untreated. As per the hospital data, the majority of youths are commonly diagnosed and treated for syphilis during this stage. There are no symptoms in the latent stage; however, the infection can persist in the body for years if left untreated. The disease then progresses to the ‘tertiary stage’. This can occur 10-30 years after the initial infection. In this stage, syphilis can affect or damage vital organs such as the nervous system, eyes, heart and ears. Regrettably, information about complications or deaths due to the “tertiary stage” of syphilis is not well studied/known in Nepal to date. According to research published in the journal BMJ Open in 2024, 94.5 percent of sexually active students were found to have had risky sexual behaviour (RSB) in Kathmandu. Nearly one-third of the participants were found to be engaged with multiple partners. The participants ranged from 18 to 32 years, with a mean age of 21. The study only focused on undergraduate students residing in hostels in Kathmandu. Thus, the prevalence of RSB among Nepali youths might be significantly greater than what the research indicates. There is a pressing need for further research into this issue.There are numerous instances where people’s travel has been halted upon testing positive for syphilis because evidence of “no syphilis” is considered a crucial health requirement in employer health assessments abroad. Although treatment can cure the disease, the markers for syphilis often remain in blood tests. This appears to put young people in a difficult situation, especially financially, as they may have already incurred significant expenses by that time.We cannot ignore the fact that syphilis is spreading at an alarming rate among young adults in Nepal. It can be inferred that having multiple sexual partners and engaging in unsafe sexual practices without proper awareness contributed to the growing prevalence of syphilis among Nepali youths. Establishing an environment that fosters open dialogue and education regarding \"reproductive and sexual health\" among young people could significantly mitigate the challenges of rising syphilis infection in the country.  \nIn under four months, tenth graders all over Nepal will appear in the School Education Examination (SEE). This is a time for students to focus on final preparations. Sadly, hard work alone won’t yield better results when the schools and curriculum fail to cater to their needs. Every year, when the results are out, many students have to endure crushing failure. However, as in previous years, the authorities have failed to learn from their mistakes. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is making baseless predictions of a 70 percent pass rate in the upcoming SEE. How will this be achieved in a country where pass rates have for years hovered below 50 percent?Among 464,785 students who appeared in the last SEE, only 222,472—47.87 percent—secured a Grade Point Average (GPA) above 1.60, which is necessary to study at a higher level. However, 242,313 students—52.13 percent—were categorised as non-graded. After the supplementary exams, over a third of them were graded, qualifying them to study in grade 11. Oli’s forecast is only plausible if the results improve by around 50 percent, which is unlikely. The grading system was introduced in 2016 to reform the examination system, focusing less on marks and more on interactive learning. But the hangover of the old School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exams persists. While the system has been upgraded, the teaching and learning are still the same. Schools are grappling with a shortage of teachers for major subjects like Science, Mathematics and English. Rural provinces like Karnali have suffered the most and some schools are hiring under-qualified teachers to fill the gaps. With teachers unable to address their problems, students have no choice but to rely on rote learning. To cope, the government is focusing on extra online classes. But such online classes for school students hold only symbolic value. In Nepal, fear has always been a tool for teaching and learning. Most schools do not foster an environment where students enjoy learning. This mentality also applies to how the education system views examinations like SEE. Students are put under pressure to perform well, as if it were a “do or die” situation. The shame of failure scars students for life. Some private schools take advantage of this fragile emotional state of students by enforcing mandatory tuition classes. Further, as schools in rural areas can’t complete the syllabus on time, it creates an opportunity for private tuition centres to generate profit as students migrate a few months before SEE to study in such centres. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres.Schedule 8 of the constitution gives local units the authority to manage school education. But the lack of a Federal Education Act, a must to implement constitutional provisions, is a big hurdle towards this laudable goal. Among its various flaws, the controversial Education Bill, registered in Parliament last year, fails to establish minimum criteria for establishing schools. The government must realise that the basics must be fulfilled before setting lofty goals. There must be mechanisms to recruit qualified teachers and retain them. It is also imperative to update the pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. The SEE marks the culmination of over a decade of schooling. Therefore, it is unfair to blame the students who have trusted the system for long. The poor SEE results are a direct reflection of the system’s failure. Whether we have the SEE or the SLC, the flawed education system will continue to jeopardise the future of hundreds of thousands of young students.  \nThe Nepal Premier League, which kicked off on Saturday, has taken the country by storm. Never before had a national-level tournament created such buzz among domestic and international audiences. Nepali cricket fanbase, who grew up watching the Indian Premier League, are now ecstatic to have their own truly international franchise league comprising no less than eight teams. The fact that people from different parts of the country are travelling to the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground to cheer on their favourite teams speaks volumes about the tournament’s mass appeal.The ‘Festival of Himalayas’ features big cricketing names like former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham, Dutch Michael Levitt, Namibia’s Gerhard Erasmus, and Australia’s Ben Cutting. Nepali cricketers—both national players and newcomers—will now get to rub shoulders with these global cricket superstars, which will greatly boost their confidence. The NPL will also hopefully offer these players enough financial incentives to pursue cricket as a profession. In fact, the recent all-format international success of the Indian national team is often attributed to the IPL, for some of the same reasons. The start of the NPL this year could thus mark a sea-change in Nepal’s success in international cricket. The league will have a global audience after getting the Star Sports Network, an internationally established TV network, as the official broadcaster; and after partnering with the Twenty-first Century Media Sports, a company that has managed many international events. They will help showcase Nepal as a global cricket destination. No wonder Nepali cricket fans are upbeat. As one fan placard during Saturday’s opening match between Janakpur Bolts and Biratnagar Kings put it: “No matter who wins it is the victory of Nepali cricket.”Done well, the NPL’s success will resonate much beyond the international sports scene. The vast majority of Nepali youths are looking to leave the country the first opportunity they get. They see no hope in their country. But when they see that cricketers and commentators and organisers from around the world are coming to their homeland to play as professionals, perhaps this feeling of disenchantment with their native country will go down a bit. Additionally, if Nepal can successfully pull off an international tournament like the NPL, there is no reason this welcoming country cannot host tournaments like the cricket Asia Cup. But there will also be challenges. The Cricket Association of Nepal has taken up the monumental task of organising an eight-team tournament. The association’s history of managing similar tournaments is checkered. For instance, the CAN-organised Nepal T20 League in 2022-23 was marred by controversies even before it kicked off due to allegations about match-fixing. The body has also faced criticisms for negligence, delayed payments and incompetence. Even in the opening match of the NPL on Saturday, the association failed to manage the crowd, which in turn led to injuries. The next day, fans were seen running on to the cricket pitch at the completion of a match. In order to maintain the integrity of Nepali cricket, it is vital to minimise such incidents. Hopefully, the CAN is learning with every match. The CAN must get the NPL right, for the tournament’s benefits are potentially limitless. The millions of international TV viewers of the NPL will get to see what a beautiful country Nepal is and this in turn could boost the country’s tourism prospects. The NPL itself, linked to a multitude of stakeholders, can create many profitable jobs, especially as other stadiums are built and the tournament expands to other parts of Nepal. Exciting times, indeed.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli heads to China today amid a heated debate on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). At the centre of the debate is an argument over whether Nepal should accept only grants to develop bilateral Nepal-China projects or such projects can also be built with loans. In the end, the two main ruling parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—decided that there would be no loan deals during Oli’s China trip. The Congress had been adamant that Nepal cannot afford any more loans and as such there was no question of adding a financial burden to the country. As things stand, 12 projects are lined up for signing. An agreement on the ‘BRI framework for cooperation’ is also likely, which, at least in theory, should add momentum to old and new bilateral projects. There are multiple readings of the two ruling parties’ disagreements on negotiating with the Chinese. In one, the Congress, as the biggest ruling party, played a dubious role by unnecessarily tying the prime minister’s hands before an important visit.Oli, in this reading, won’t have much to show at the end of the trip. Yet there can be an alternate and more charitable reading of the recent sequence of events—and one which will be more salubrious to the country’s interests. The BRI became so controversial on the eve of Oli’s China trip precisely because there was lack of clarity on what being a part of it entailed for Nepal. When the country signed up to the initiative’s framework agreement back in 2017, there was little debate even as grey areas galore. For instance, the document Nepal signed seven years ago is yet to be made public, fanning many speculations. In this context, the new debate on the kind of cooperation the country can expect under the BRI was much needed. Unlike in the past when they were querulous opponents, this time, as coalition partners, the Congress and the UML were forced to come to an understanding on the initiative. They did this through a four-member taskforce that carefully dissected the new China-proposed framework. The Nepali side has tweaked the new BRI framework document in line with the suggestions of the taskforce and sent it back to China for final approval. Nepal has long felt the need for a broad political understanding on vital foreign policy issues. Yet such an understanding has invariably been made a victim to top leaders’ never-ending jockeying for power. This time, the differences between the Congress and the UML over the BRI, and the wider debate it sparked, have helped the country arrive at a more nuanced position on how to engage with China, one of Nepal’s two most important foreign friends. The deals Prime Minister Oli locks up in Beijing matter. But, more importantly, the decision of the country’s two biggest political forces to devise a common platform on a vital foreign policy issue bodes well for Nepal. If and when Oli goes to India, perhaps the two parties can come up with a similar common position. And the same while dealing with other important foreign actors. The sum of these understandings can in turn form a solid basis for a more consensus based Nepali foreign policy. Perhaps this extrapolation is a little simplistic. But the goal of greater consensus looks more achievable today than it did even a week ago.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is preparing to visit China in the first week of December. It will be his first bilateral visit after assuming the office in mid-July. Nepali prime ministers generally go to New Delhi first. Sudheer Sharma, former editor-in-chief of Kantipur daily, has recently published a pair of books on Nepal-China relations—‘Himalpari ko Huri’ and ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’. He also frequently writes on Nepal’s relations with its two big neighbours. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Sharma on the eve of Oli’s China visit. Prime Minister Oli is all set to visit China next month. Many find it curious that he decided to go to Beijing first before visiting New Delhi. How do you see this development?Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have given high priority to visits and engagements with our two neighbours–India and China. This is natural. Generally, the prime ministers first visited India and then went to China. I believe Prime Minister Oli tried to do the same. We see regular engagements with New Delhi at various levels. Prime Minister Oli had met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in the last week of September. In August, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India and met Prime Minister Modi and her counterpart S Jaishankar, among other key officials there. But Delhi has yet to extend the invitation to the prime minister. So he seems to have decided not to defer his foreign visits for long and chose to visit Beijing first. We have to see this in two perspectives. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and he is also going to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even in the past, Oli developed good relations with Chinese leaders. So, there are expectations that he may make the visit fruitful. An equally important concern is whether this visit impacts our relations with the southern neighbour India. I think the prime minister should focus on implementing the agreements reached during his previous visits to Beijing and during Chinese leaders’ Nepal visits. He should be mindful of not irking the southern neighbour while reaching any agreement with the northern one. I believe the prime minister is conscious of this.India often seems anxious about Chinese involvement in Nepal. Do you see any risk of this visit increasing the distance between Oli and India?Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited China first after he became prime minister in 2008. Even in the past, some Nepali prime ministers including Tanka Prasad Acharya went to China on their first official visit. This is not unusual. The two prime ministers—Oli and Modi—recently met in New York. India doesn’t seem ready to intensify bilateral engagements with Nepal immediately. So it is natural for the prime minister to increase engagements with China, without taking any steps that could provoke India. We should stop seeking Indian signals when dealing with China, and vice versa. We should maintain parallel relations with both the neighbours without antagonising any side.In this context, what should be the prime minister’s priorities during his China visit?We have to end our chronic problem of signing agreements and not implementing them. We make announcements and forget them. There are also some infrastructure projects China pledged to develop but there is little progress. So the prime minister should draw the Chinese leadership’s attention and press them to complete the projects on time. Some important projects such as Mugling-Pokhara and Narayanghat-Butwal road upgradation by the Chinese side have been slow, causing hardships to people. Even such issues should be communicated to the political level. Also, there are several commitments made by the Chinese government but left unimplemented. This creates an impression that China makes big promises but doesn’t keep them. Prime Minister Oli often highlights the Tokha-Chhahare road upgrade project under Chinese support but there is no satisfactory progress. Progress on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) on Nepal-China cross-border railway is unclear as well. Nepal expected some substantive support from China to make the Pokhara international airport financially feasible. Some concrete steps are needed to operate this airport. There are reports that the government has requested China to convert the loan taken to develop the airport into a grant and the prime minister will push for this during his visit. It will be an achievement if the prime minister succeeds in this. In the course of writing your recent books, you extensively interacted with Chinese officials and experts, as well as with their Nepali counterparts. What are the major factors delaying the projects? Is it lack of preparation on the Nepali side or is there any problem on the Chinese side?First, we [Nepalis] sign agreements but don’t work seriously to implement them. This is true in the case of agreements with other countries as well. We are negligent. Red tape is another problem. Third, China gives less priority to small countries like Nepal as it has so many big issues with other countries. We have to constantly follow up with them to speed things up. In the past, the two sides agreed to open more border points. This should be expedited. The people-to-people relations on the border areas were historically based on social interactions at the community level. People used to trade, marry those from the other side and interact in various ways. Of late, despite progress on infrastructure development, social engagement has been hindered. This should be rectified and new border points should be opened at Dolpa, Mustang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Taplejung, and Sankhuwasabha. We should think beyond the Capital-centric approach. This will help strengthen relations at the people’s level and give alternatives in our connectivity. We should put connectivity at the core of our relations with the two neighbours. In the past decade, we have made good progress in improving connectivity with India. A study report has been prepared on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway project. We are building an expressway linking Kathmandu and the southern belt of the country. Integrated check posts (ICPs) have come into operation along Nepal-India border points. Cross border electricity transmission lines have been built and we have increased energy trade with India. We have thus progressed in deepening connectivity with India. We lack reliable north-south highways. Therefore, the prime minister should make connectivity a major agenda of his China visit. Given the lacklustre performance of past projects, can we be optimistic about big cross-border infra projects under Chinese help?Nepal and China have committed to run some projects under the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) concept. A key component of this concept is to upgrade connectivity between Kathmandu and Kerung that includes roads as well as a railway. The concept also envisions operating other border points. The railway project requires more study and investment and needs to consider various other factors. For now, we should prioritise opening the aforementioned border points. The Korala border point at Mustang has huge potential. Nepal is making a road that connects Mustang with the Sunauli border point with India. Centuries ago, people from Banaras used to travel to Tibet via Mustang through this route. It can be revived and made a trilateral trade route between Nepal, India and China. Similarly, Limi in Humla, Olangchugola in Taplejung, among others places, can be developed as alternative routes. As far as Kerung-Kathmandu connection is concerned, let’s first give priority to building a reliable highway. The railway project should be developed with a broader understanding between Nepal, India and China. Beijing will develop such a big project only with the big Indian markets in mind. More importantly, there are some signs of improvements in India-China relations. We have to use this as an opportunity.There are differences in the way we work and the Chinese do and there are systemic and linguistic differences as well. These factors are often blamed for lack of progress in development activities carried out with Chinese support. Can Nepalis work closely with Chinese, just like we do with Indians?Until a decade ago, several projects developed under Indian support were left in limbo. In 2015, India imposed a blockade against Nepal and that sparked anti-India sentiment. Then, India expedited several projects. This drastic change became possible as the political leadership in India realised its mistake and showed the commitment to improve things.But the same thing is not happening with China because there is a “great wall” between Nepal and China when it comes to understanding each other. The Chinese haven’t understood Nepali context. The northern neighbour should be more open and liberal in helping Nepal. Second, Nepal should also stop approaching China only when our relations with India sour. We have left this impression on the Chinese psyche. First, we should be clear about what exactly we want from China, forge consensus among major political forces and hold talks with the Chinese leaders. Then, we should be equally committed to implementing the agreements reached this way. People now take announcements of building big projects under Chinese support as propaganda. Therefore, this time the prime minister should stress on pushing the pending projects. The prime minister should tell them that even the projects announced during President Xi’s visit have not progressed and that has created a bad impression of China in Nepal.There are some differences between the coalition partners—the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress—about the funding modality of projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). Do you think this may cause a problem?The UML wants to expedite the BRI projects while the Congress has insisted that we should accept only grants and not loans under the BRI. The prime minister should clear such dilemmas and come up with common views before he leaves for Beijing. Once they come up with a common view on such key issues, it will give a positive and strong message. The Chinese side will take it more seriously because the strong government led by the two largest parties can implement bilateral agreements.We have instances of Nepal’s political parties standing for and against important projects funded by other countries. This was seen in the case of the US-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and China’s BRI. Moreover, in the past, the Chinese leaders created an impression that they preferred working with communist parties and leaders. This is neither in the interest of Nepal nor of China.There are also discussions on signing the BRI implementation plan during the visit. What are the things Nepal should be careful about while signing BRI-related agreements?Trying to get grants instead of loans is in itself good. But there is no need to be prejudiced against the BRI per se. Nepal reportedly wants to include some points specifying waivers in specific projects. We should be very careful while signing project-based agreements. For instance, what will be the conditions and funding modality of a project, will it be developed under grants or loans etcetera. All our technical experts and other brains should be engaged while signing project-based agreements and specifying conditions and other nitty-gritty to ensure that we will not have unnecessary liability and debt burden in the future. Over time, Nepal has rightly adopted a steadfast position saying that we don’t join a strategic alliance proposed by any country. It stayed away from the US government’s State Partnership Programme (SPP) and China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI) as well as from India’s security umbrella. But we can’t be isolated in development initiatives. We have to take support from India, China, the US and other countries based on our needs.Do you think the Chinese side will show magnanimity on Nepal’s requests, for instance on waiving off the loan to develop Pokhara international airport?Though the Chinese ambassador to Nepal last year claimed the airport project to be under the BRI, the case is different because it was signed years before we joined the BRI. And, converting that loan into a grant is not a big deal for China. They should show magnanimity given the support we have been providing to China for a long time. If you see things historically, Nepal has helped China by suppressing Khampa revolt, preventing free Tibet movements on our soil and showing a steadfast commitment to One-China policy. China, which is now prosperous, should definitely show magnanimity and waive off loan of Pokhara airport. They shouldn’t see relations with Nepal through a purely transactional lens.In your book, you describe 2008 as a watershed after which the engagements between Nepal and China increased drastically. But why couldn’t we benefit from the northern neighbour in terms of development?The Chinese side looks more interested in increasing engagement. They like to showcase their development before foreigners. But more than lavish hospitality, we need substantive support from the neighbour, which has emerged as the world’s second-largest economy. But we should be clear about what we want from our engagements with China.  The Nepali side doesn’t present its proposals clearly. On certain issues, our politicians give mixed signals. This time, if this government of two largest parties reaches a certain agreement with China and remains committed to implement it, other forces can’t hinder it. The same approach can be replicated while dealing with India, the US, Japan or other friendly countries.Is difficult geography still a barrier in developing cross-border infrastructure projects and deepening relations between Nepal and China?In our textbooks we read that the Himalayan range is a natural barrier between the two countries. In my book ‘Bhikshu Byapar ra Bidroha’, I have explored and described how people from Nepal and northern India had been traversing through these mountains and there were interactions and engagements between the people in this part of the world since the 5th and 6th centuries. So, the mountains weren’t barriers even at that time. Now technology has made things easier. We have to think about how to connect with these two big economies. We have multiple east-west highways. Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries. \nOn Thursday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi and Gandaki Province.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAmid criticism from Nepali Congress leaders, Nepal and China agreed to implement Belt and Road Initiative projects under \"aid assistance financing,\" raising concerns about loan implications.\nNepal has begun exporting tea to China after Beijing eased import procedures, opening up a potential new market for Nepali tea producers who have faced challenges exporting to India.\nThapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital provides breast milk from its human milk bank to vulnerable infants born in other hospitals, aiming to reduce neonatal deaths.\nJanakpur Bolts and Sudurpaschim Royals maintained their undefeated streaks in the NPL T20, as Lalit Rajbanshi's 3-31 and Saud's fifer wrecked Pokhara Avengers and Kathmandu Gurkhas, respectively, while James Neesham's 40* guided Janakpur to victory.\nChitwan Rhinos set a target of 131 runs for Karnali Yaks in the first match of the Nepal Premier League, with Ravi Bopara contributing 59 not out and Bipin Prasad Sharma taking 3 wickets for Karnali.\nTo its credit, the team of KP Sharma Oli in Beijing somehow convinced the Chinese to sign the BRI framework agreement on Wednesday. The Chinese don’t do hasty negotiations. A day earlier, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had met his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang. On the same evening, there was a meeting between Oli and Chinese President Xi Jinping. A joint statement was issued later in the day, outlining all the major developments of Oli’s trip. The much-hyped framework for BRI cooperation had found no mention in the statement. China watchers back home started bemoaning the ‘abject failure’ of Oli’s China trip. But then Team Oli, which included his chief advisor Bishnu Rimal and chief economic advisor Yubaraj Khatiwada, pulled a rabbit out of the bag.The final terminology used to describe the money that will come into Nepal under the BRI rubric has some ambiguity, as ‘aid financing modalities’ can include both grants and loans. But then, such in-between terminologies are common in bilateral negotiations where each side is looking to keep certain constituencies back home happy. The important thing is that both the top leaders of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties in the country, agreed on the term. And when it was presented to the Chinese, so did they. The ‘aid financing modalities’ do not preclude all kinds of loans. In fact, the understanding seems to be that the term means that Nepal will consider low-interest loans such as it was getting from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. That is how it should be. How can Nepal accept loans from the rest of the world but shun it from China? The Congress leadership also seems to have realised the flaw in its earlier reasoning that no kind of loan from China was acceptable. The good thing is that the agreement with China is likely to last as it has the backing of the country’s two major parties, who together make nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority. It was the differences between these two on loans from China that helped them flesh out the outstanding issues over the BRI framework. This in turn added clarity to the issues. (Some differences on the BRI persist inside the Congress, but that is to be expected in a democratic party.) Perhaps the Chinese this time thought that even though they were being asked to hurry, the proposal on the table, which had the backing of Nepal’s two major political parties, was worth signing. There are still many unknowns about the BRI. But at least Nepal stood its ground when necessary, while also not being rigid. This signals a maturing of Nepali diplomacy. After the BRI framework agreement, we again hope that the Congress and the UML and other parties can come to similar understandings on Nepal’s relations with India and the US–and on Nepal’s other vital ties. Consensual foreign policy is the need of the hour. Right now, it is worth celebrating that China, which harboured deep suspicions of the Congress, will be more amenable to dealing with Nepal’s biggest party. Their mutual suspicions were poisoning Nepal-China relations. Perhaps the long-stuck train of the BRI in Nepal will now finally start chugging.  \nFor several weeks now, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) of the Government of Nepal has put out a draft text in Nepali on its website of the “National Book Policy, 2081 BS”. In the paragraph headed “Background”, the text states, “For quality education and learning, we need quality books. For the easy availability of quality books, their creation, production, distribution and storage aspects need to be strengthened and their writing, translation, editing, production, publication, printing, distribution, and sale aspects need to be developed and managed.” It adds that the Government of Nepal has drafted this policy to do all of the above.In the same section, the text further delineates a litany of problems facing the sector. Apart from the new challenges emanating from readers spending too much time looking at various types of screens and too little time reading books, the problems listed are pretty much the same as those identified in related discussions held in the 1990s. The policy draft text lists six objectives in very generic terms. For instance, objective three reads: “To enhance the professional capacity of sectors related to the writing, publication, preservation and promotion of books.” Under the subsequently given execution strategies, the policy draft lists three strategies that align with the above-mentioned objective three. They deal with managing the intellectual property rights of various contents, creating a national book depository/book bank and the development and diversification of how libraries are run in the country. These are further discussed in the subsequently given karyanitis. In a section titled “The Bases for the Execution of this Policy”, it is mentioned that the MoEST will produce the necessary working procedure for resource management and related criteria and also coordinate with provincial and local governments. For the execution, monitoring and evaluation of this policy, the draft proposes creating a National Book Council under the chairmanship of the minister or state minister of the MoEST. The council’s secretariat will be the appropriate division in the same ministry. Under the sub-title “The Management of Financial Sources”, the policy draft generically states that “the necessary financial resources needed to execute this policy will be managed.”The brief extracts given above from the 16-page “National Book Policy” draft should convince the readers that the entire text reads like a pious but generic tract, full of good intentions that are unlikely to be implemented for lack of proper identification of where the challenges lie and at what levels they need to be tackled. So, it is not clear what has prompted the process of creating this kind of draft at the moment. Given the emphasis that libraries get on it, is there some association of librarians currently behind this idea? Or perhaps some bureaucrats in the MoEST wanted to please their bosses by working on the policy draft, which, it is stated, was generated after “continuous discussions” with “pertinent stakeholders.” The stakeholders haven’t been listed in the text. As a member of a research organisation which has published 116 academic books on a broad variety of subjects in the past 23 years and promoted books through the hosting of numerous book discussions and commissioning of their reviews in two journals, we were not invited to any such discussion at the MoEST or elsewhere.Getting it rightThose who run the federal bureaucracy don’t seem to understand (or if they do, they don’t care about) some fundamental points. First, creating another entity at the centre, namely, a National Book Council under the chairmanship of a minister in the federal MoEST, will do virtually nothing to produce better-quality books. In particular, such an entity cannot enhance the professional capacity of writers, publishers, librarians and other promoters of books. For sure, the council will be a good place to reward some senior bureaucrats or party-affiliated buddhijibis as members but it would simply be institutionally too far from the creators of book contents to be of any real consequence. Second, we need a distributed mechanism of incentive provision that is much closer to the book creators. Let me explain by thinking about the kinds of people currently involved in producing books—just academic books for this analysis—in Nepal. Such books are being produced by colleagues who work for universities in Nepal and elsewhere, others who work in academic NGOs and think tanks and the rest (including journalists) who are independent researchers. For those affiliated with universities in Nepal, the way to incentivise the production of books is through offering writing fellowships from their mother institutions with earmarked funds in the budgets provided to the universities by the University Grants Commission. Such fellowships make the book writing possible, and it could then be published by university-owned publishing presses, about which I wrote recently (“On University Presses”, November 1). Similarly, for researchers who work in academic NGOs or are institutionally independent, the disbursement of such grants from an already existing federal government entity would be helpful initially. In the long run, however, as I have argued many times, this function can be handled by a Social Science Research Council run by academics. In other words, public money must support the creation of books through relevant closer-to-the-creator institutions. Third, if the policy seeks to repurpose existing entities, they must be appropriately equipped for the additional function. For instance, the policy seeks to task the existing National Library as the national depository of books (“Book Bank”). For this, the draft says the necessary legal provisions will be made. That is a minor thing compared to the main challenge faced by the National Library for a long time, namely, it is a severely under-budgeted institution. Since the building in which the library was housed until 2015 was damaged by the earthquakes of that year, it has been homeless. Its proposed building in Jamal in Kathmandu has not materialised yet, and as far as I can tell, no government seems to be in a rush to complete it soon. In a country where the rebuilding of the Dharahara is prioritised over the National Library, it seems a bit dishonest to task the latter institution with additional responsibilities without first erecting its proper building and provisioning it with extra funds and human personnel. We don’t need another policy text for that.Fourth, instead of promoting new public libraries under the rubric that all local political jurisdictions should have one such entity, all three levels of government need to support existing librarians with block and incentive-driven grants. Many other things could be said about the policy draft, but a list of pious intentions will not give us better books. Instead, the Government of Nepal needs to provide public funds to real stakeholders who have been doing relatively good things for the book sector with their own meagre resources. \nIt's been more than a year since the October 7 events, when militants from the Palestinian group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing hundreds and taking dozens of hostages.The Israeli retaliation which followed was brutal and seemed to have no red lines. Already under blockade before October 7, Israel imposed a complete siege on the Gaza Strip, limiting the entry of food, fuel and medicines. There was a clear intent to starve and permanently displace the population. A few months into the assault, Gaza turned into a wasteland, with almost the entire population displaced and more than 80 percent of buildings destroyed. It is not surprising that the International Criminal Court, in its recent verdict, concluded that there was strong evidence for crimes against humanity while issuing the arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Aside from the nearly 45,000 official deaths, a large number of which are women and children, the year-long carnage in Gaza has also brought forth harsh aspects of the contemporary world order. Wither international law?The year in Gaza has shown the irrelevance of international law and organisations. Over the past year, the United Nations (UN) has issued daily warnings and reported on the dire humanitarian situation, and passed resolutions in the general assembly appealing for a ceasefire, all to no avail. Time and again, Israel has been bailed out in the UN Security Council by its Western allies, in particular, the US. The only resolution that managed to get passed in the Security Council did not result in any tangible steps towards a ceasefire. To be fair, the UN has been equally unsuccessful in stopping conflicts in other regions of the world, including Sudan and Ukraine, underscoring its broader inability to prevent and stop wars and conflicts. Concomitantly, Israel has wilfully disregarded international law on the protection of civilians in war. By insisting that the militants use civilians as ‘human shields’, Israel has blurred the well-established distinction in international law between combatants and non-combatants.There are reports that Israel used AI-powered systems to generate targets. Israeli strikes targeted hospitals, schools, shelters, ambulances and humanitarian zones, all contrary to basic human decency. Earlier this year, a tragic illustration of this was the death of seven volunteers from the World Central Kitchen who were bombed by an Israeli drone strike on their cars. Western connivance It was not just Israel that flouted the international law. The year in Gaza showed us that countries that usually voice concerns for human rights and denounce violence were willing collaborators.The US has flown more than 500 flights to Israel containing weapons and munitions. The most notorious of these were the US-made 2,000-pound bombs dropped on houses in Gaza. The UK and Germany have kept up with regular arms shipments and intelligence. Germany used the opportunity to its advantage, becoming the number two supplier of weapons to Israel over the past year. The shipment of arms and the diplomatic support to Israel was done with full knowledge of the actual events unfolding in Gaza. Thus, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken disregarded reports from his own state department that Israel was blocking US humanitarian assistance. Had he acted on them, US law would have forced the Biden administration to halt weapons supply to Gaza. Keir Starmer, the UK Prime Minister and a former lawyer who has advised on human rights issues, repeatedly denied in the British Parliament there was an ongoing genocide in Gaza. Compromised mainstream mediaThe year in Gaza has also revealed the role of mainstream Western media and exposed the claims of objectivity and fairness. From carrying false reports of beheaded babies to making unverifiable allegations of widespread sexual abuse on October 7, mainstream Western media went with Israel’s version of events. Israel has not allowed independent journalists inside the Gaza Strip, and everything it told the Western media, such as the presence of a Hamas command centre under Al Shifa Hospital, was taken at face value. Few, if any, mainstream journalists questioned the basis for the routine Israeli claim of militants hiding in the civilian population. We saw systematic internal bias by mainstream media organisations against Palestinians. Palestinian civilian losses were frequently described in the passive, with the briefest mention of Israeli strikes or shelling that caused their death. The New York Times published a front page photo of a Gaza boy with both his arms amputated under the caption ‘Surviving Gaza’; unless one turns to the whole story, one wouldn't learn what led to his condition. The bias was not limited to right-wing outlets. A leaked memo from the liberal New York Times revealed forbidding journalists from using the words ‘Palestine’, ‘apartheid’ or ‘genocide’ when talking about the events in Gaza. Earlier this October, a large number of former and present media persons signed a letter to protest the BBC's bias in its reporting of Gaza. The latest example of this bias was the wilful misrepresentation of clashes involving Israeli football fans and Amsterdam locals of Arab descent as ‘antisemitic’ while suppressing that the Israeli visitors had earlier clashed with locals, torn down flags, and chanted dehumanising slogans mocking the dead children of Gaza.Weakening of democratic freedoms The year in Gaza also made evident the repression of democratic protest and voices critical of Israel. From the initial days, large groups of protesters in western cities took to the streets, mostly peacefully, to call for an end to the violence. The protesters, sometimes numbering in the thousands, were smeared as ‘antisemitic’ and ‘Hamas supporters’ by Western officials. Countries with long traditions of protesting, such as France and Germany, outlawed protests. Wearing the Palestinian Keffiyeh or the Palestinian lapel was grounds for cancellation or denial of entry. Several independent journalists have been detained in the UK for supporting ‘proscribed’ groups. On the lines of the US Congress, the German parliament recently passed a unanimous resolution making civil society groups critical of Israel’s conduct unable to receive government aid. The UK and German governments now decide what is ‘acceptable’ freedom of speech.In an alternate world, Western countries, led by the US, would have long back imposed the two-state solution on close ally Israel. Palestinians would live in safety and dignity in their own state, free from Israeli occupation and control. That such a reality is far from being realised shows the cruel nature of the world order where there are different rules for different people. \nWith the by-elections to elect 44 local representatives in 32 districts done and dusted, reviews and analysis of the final results are pouring in thick and fast. Given the palpable discontent against the parties from across the political spectrum, predicting the bypolls results was not easy. Leaders from the CPN (Maoist Centre) have been in a celebratory mood since Tuesday after winning a couple of important seats after years of electoral setbacks. The former rebel outfit that emerged the clear first party in the 2008 general elections had been consistently losing votes and seats in subsequent polls.On the other hand, leaders from the CPN-UML don’t appear excited despite the party winning some important office bearer positions in different local units. The Nepali Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, lost some key positions in a few units as well. Unhappy with the results, the two largest parties have decided to review the outcomes through the respective party mechanisms.One noteworthy feature of the recent bypolls was that voters this time showed little faith in the new forces, unlike in the previous polls. Traditional fringe parties like the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party and the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist) that failed to get national party status in parliament in the last general elections picked up a seat each this time. But new forces such as the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Janamat Party didn’t do well. The RSP won only a ward chair in Kathmandu while the votes garnered by its candidates in other local units were negligible. The RSP, which emerged the fourth largest force in 2022 barely six months after its formation, had done better in the by-elections in April 2023. However, it couldn’t maintain the momentum when a by-election was held to elect a federal lawmaker from Ilam in April this year. The Janamat Party, another outfit that emerged from the last general election, failed to get even a single seat this time. Interestingly, the voters also discarded forces like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party that champions revival of the Hindu monarchy. The pro-monarchy party, the fifth largest in the federal legislature, didn’t win a single seat in Sunday by-polls.For long-term success, a political party needs to have clarity in its agenda and vision, a robust organisation, and strong bond with the general people. Elections are key yardsticks to gauge whether a political party has these strengths. There is broad consensus that the public is disenchanted with major political forces like the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre that have ruled this country by turns for the past two decades. People in previous elections gave a chance to new outfits as they were frustrated by the old forces’ failure to deliver. The level of support these new forces got was perhaps not an endorsement of their vision and agenda, which are sketchy. While these forces succeeded in fanning anger against the incumbents, they failed to offer anything better. Experts caution against drawing hasty conclusions based on the results of elections held for just 44 local level seats. Yet the by-polls were held across all seven provinces, and covered the capital city Kathmandu to remote villages, hills to plains, east to west. In sum, Nepalis are giving a clear message to the political forces old and new: do not take our support for granted.  \nUS President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday he has chosen former Senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China, tapping a former politician with business experience to help steer relations riven by deep mistrust and trade tensions.“He will be instrumental in implementing my strategy to maintain Peace in the region, and a productive working relationship with China’s leaders,” Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.Trump, who takes office on January 20, 2025, has said he will impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods unless Beijing does more to stop the trafficking of the highly addictive narcotic fentanyl.He also threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.Perdue, a Republican from Georgia who served in the Senate from 2015-2021, previously lived in Hong Kong during a 40-year career as a business executive.Perdue’s nomination marks a return to the frequent practice over recent decades of sending former politicians to the US embassy in Beijing, after President Joe Biden tapped veteran career diplomat Nicholas Burns in 2021.Trump has nominated China hardliners for other senior roles in his administration, including Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, in a signal his policy toward the United States’ main strategic rival could go beyond trade measures.In his first term as president, Trump named former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad as his ambassador to China. Branstad sought to leverage his ties with Chinese officials, including with Xi Jinping before he became China’s top leader, to help navigate trade tensions. But the two sides still plunged headlong into an unprecedented trade war.The ambassador’s role in fraught bilateral relations remains to be seen. Some analysts say Beijing is likely to seek direct presidential or high-level engagement with Trump and his closest advisers, in order to navigate the almost-certain return of trade tensions. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will appoint a new prime minister in the coming days whose top priority will be getting a 2025 budget adopted by parliament, he said on Thursday after the government was toppled by lawmakers.Michel Barnier, a veteran conservative, became the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history when he resigned on Thursday after parliament voted him out over his fiscal plans, barely three months after he was appointed.In a televised address to the nation, Macron said he would name a successor to Barnier “in the coming days.”“The priority will be the budget,” Macron said.A special law to roll over the 2024 budget and avoid any gap will be put forward by mid-December. Then the new government will prepare a full budget early next year, in particular to account for inflation, for a vote by parliament.Macron, whose ill-fated decision to call a snap ballot in June delivered a much-divided parliament, denied he was responsible for the political crisis.The president, who represents a centrist party, said the far-right and left-wing parties united in an “anti-republican front” to create “a mess” by ousting Barnier.Macron has been weakened by the crisis but resisted calls by some in the opposition for him to resign. He reaffirmed that he will stay in office until his term ends in May 2027.“The mandate you have given me is for five years and I will fulfil it until the very end,” he said.In a 10-minute speech, he added that the new government should represent a variety of parties willing to take part in it or at least agree not to censure it. He did not say which ones.Meanwhile, Macron has asked Barnier and his government to stay in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed.FISCAL DEFICIT, DIVIDED PARLIAMENTIt was unclear if a new government will be in place before a ceremony on Saturday to reopen Notre-Dame Cathedral, which has been renovated after a devastating fire. World leaders including U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are expected to attend.Macron cited the rebuilding of the Gothic cathedral and successful Paris Olympics over the summer as evidence that France can deliver.“They are proof that we can do great things. We can do the impossible,” he said. “The world admires us for that.”Macron had lunch on Thursday with Francois Bayrou, whose name has been cited by French media as a possible successor to Barnier, Le Parisien newspaper reported. An aide to Bayrou did not respond to a request for comment.Any new prime minister will face the same challenge of dealing with a fractured parliament that Barnier did, notably passing a budget at a time when France needs to rein in its public finances.French bonds and stocks rallied on Thursday on what some traders said was profit-taking following the widely expected outcome of parliament’s no-confidence vote that ousted Barnier. But the relief rally is unlikely to last, given the scale of political uncertainty.“Until potential new elections, ongoing political uncertainty is likely to keep the risk premium on French assets elevated,” SocGen analysts said in a note. The earliest possible date for a parliamentary election would be in July.The fall of France’s government leaves the country without a clear path towards reducing its fiscal deficit, and the most likely outcome is less belt-tightening than previously planned, credit rating agency Standard and Poor’s said. \nOn Friday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in Koshi and Gandaki Province along with the hilly regions of Bagmati and Gandaki Province. The rest of the country is to remain mainly fair.Light rain is likely to occur at one or two places of the hilly regions of Koshi Province.Tonight the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in the hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini Province and mainly fair in the rest of the country.According to the Meteorological analysis, the country is under partial influence of westerly winds.On Thursday Janakpur experienced the maximum temperature of 28°C, while Jumla registered the lowest at -4.9°C. No rainfall was reported across the country during the last 24 hours. \n\nThe Special Court has convicted four top officials in the corruption case involving the procurement of two wide-body Airbus A330 jets by Nepal Airlines Corporation, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’.The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) had filed a case against 32 individuals including the four after concluding that they caused a loss totalling Rs1.47 billion to the state coffers in the procurement deal. The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the payment of the last instalment in 2018.A bench of the court chair Tek Narayan Kunwar and members Tej Narayan Singh Rai and Ritendra Thapa convicted the then tourism secretary and ex-officio chair of the corporation, Shankar Adhikari; the corporation’s then general manager Sugat Ratna Kansakar; and then joint secretaries of the ministry Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane and Shishir Dhungana.The bench, however, acquitted the then tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, among others, who had been named as defendants by the anti-corruption body.The court has sentenced Kansakar to 2 years and six months in jail, Adhikari to 1 year and 9 months, and Dhungana and Lamichhane to 1 year and six months each in jail.In its charge sheet, the CIAA had accused the minister and the officials of going against the procurement law and accepting the supplier’s escalation condition to purchase second-hand aircraft, a condition which came to $6.78 million (Rs74.58 million) of the $209.6 million valuation. Escalation condition is a rule in a contract that says if certain things change, like prices, then the terms of the contract can also change. Investigators suspect that the condition was included in the $209.6 million deal to covertly generate kickbacks for the officials involved. \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has yet again postponed the general convention of its student wing All Nepal National Independent Students’ Union (Revolutionary).An office-bearers’ meeting of the party on Thursday decided to defer the 23rd general convention, which was slated to commence in the Capital on Sunday. After several postponements, the national jamboree of the union started in September. However, it was suspended without electing the leadership following a dispute over the selection of convention representatives and whether or not set up an age bar for the leadership.With no sign for the resumption of the convention, a team of party’s student leaders, led by vice-chair Keshab Rawal, staged a hunger strike demanding the national gathering be held in December second week and leadership elected through a vote. They withdrew their strike with the party leadership agreeing to hold the convention starting on December 8. However, the party meeting led by chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal decided to defer the convention citing lack of preparations due to the need for the party to focus on local by-polls.The next Standing Committee meeting called for December 12 will take a decision regarding its student wing’s convention, according to party leaders.The student leaders, however, seem unconvinced. Rawal, who also is a contender for the union’s presidency, accused the party leadership of treating students as their slaves, who must obey them without question.“This is not just interference in student affairs, it shows they see us as slaves,” Rawal told the Post. “This is unacceptable. I don’t believe the party’s next meeting will announce the date. I will stage a protest again.” Though the party has cited lack of preparation for the postponement, insiders suggest that Dahal is worried because his chosen candidate may not win the elections. “The second rung leaders do not agree with Dahal’s selection. Dahal is avoiding election because he fears his candidate might lose,” said a party leader. Around a dozen student leaders backed by different factions within the party are in the race for the union’s presidency. Party’s senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha supports Pawan Karki. Karki had been running a parallel organisation within the union after Dahal picked Pancha Singh as chair two years back. Barshaman Pun is pushing for Dipesh Pun or Tukman Mahara and Janardan Sharma wants Madan Bhul or Narayan Khanal. Both the leaders are deputy general secretaries in the Maoist Centre.Naresh Regmi has the backing of Pampha Bhusal and Dev Gurung, the party’s vice-chair and general secretary, respectively. Although Dahal hasn’t openly endorsed any candidate, he reportedly has a soft corner for Regmi. By supporting Regmi ahead, Dahal wants to please Bhusal and Gurung to garner their support to induct Netra Bikram Chand, who had earlier splintered from the Maoist Centre, in the party. But deputy general secretaries Pun and Sharma reportedly do not want Chand in the party.The deputy general secretaries, though they are rivals, have started coming together when it comes to challenging Dahal’s leadership. “They feel that Dahal is imposing his decision by dividing them. It is clear that Pun and Sharma will not accept Dahal’s candidate for the union’s chairperson. They might even field a common candidate to counter Dahal’s candidate if voting takes place,” said the leader. “Defeat of Dahal’s candidate would mean he is losing grip on the party organisation.”Some of the student leaders, however, believe the December 12 meeting would take a decision regarding the convention. “I believe the party will either decide to hold voting or will handpick the leadership,” said Regmi.For years, the Maoist Centre’s leadership has directly selected the leadership of its student union. As many as 2,323 representatives were handpicked for the national gathering in September.However, a section of the leaders raised questions over the legality of around 70 representatives, most of whom are enrolled to various institutions under the Council for Vocational Education and Training. The dissident group argues that these representatives were handpicked without following the proper selection process.The differences escalated to the extent where representatives smashed the furniture at the Kirtipur venue of the convention twice as they clashed. A group of student leaders, taking cue from Mahara, the son of Jokh Bahadur Mahara, former Lumbini chief minister, even brandished a khukuri (Gurkha knife). A large number of police personnel were deployed at the Tribhuvan University campus to contain the protest.Right from the commencement of the conference, there were strong calls to impose an age limit for student leaders. But not everyone agreed to that. Without consensus, the issue was to be decided through voting. However, the voting didn’t take place due to the lack of agreement over the representatives leading to the convention’s postponement. \nCricket fans can gear up for an exciting day in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) on Friday as two thrilling matches are lined up at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground in Kirtipur.The day begins at 9:15 am with Karnali Yaks, led by marquee player and captain Sompal Kami, battling against the Chitwan Rhinos, captained by Kushal Malla. Karnali boasts an impressive lineup, including stars like Paul Stirling, Babar Hayat, and Zeeshan Maqsood, alongside emerging talents like Gulshan Kumar Jha and Dev Khanal.The Rhinos, meanwhile, bring a mix of experience and firepower, featuring international players like Sohail Tanvir, Ravi Bopara, and Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton. With both teams eager to dominate, this match promises to set the tone for the day.The second clash at 1:15 pm sees the Lumbini Lions, captained by Rohit Kumar Paudel, taking on the Pokhara Avengers, led by Kushal Bhurtel. The Lions’ squad includes foreign stars such as Ben Cutting and Ramon Simmonds, supported by young talents like Bibek Yadav and Sundeep Jora.The Avengers will rely on their marquee player Bhurtel and international players like Bas de Leede, Matt Critchley, and Michael Leask to turn the game in their favour. Both teams are aiming to climb the league standings with a win in this encounter.With stakes high and talented squads in action, Friday’s matches are set to offer thrilling moments for cricket enthusiasts and could significantly impact the league’s playoff race. \nJanakpur Bolts continued their dominant run, securing their third consecutive victory with a seven-wicket win over Pokhara Avengers in the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL), at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Thursday.Chasing a modest target of 139 runs set by Pokhara, Janakpur reached their goal in just 17.1 overs at the loss of three wickets. Lahiru Milantha led the charge with a quick-fire 45 runs off 32 balls, including eight boundaries. Supporting him, Aasif Sheikh scored 33 off 34 balls, while James Neesham and Harsh Thaker remained unbeaten on 40 and 13 runs respectively.For Pokhara, bowlers Bipin Khatri, Michael Leask, and Kushal Bhurtel claimed one wicket each.Earlier, after electing to bat first, Pokhara managed a total of 138/7 in their allotted 20 overs. Matthew Cross top-scored with 35 runs off 30 balls, including three fours and a six, before being caught off Lalit Rajbanshi's bowling. Michael Leask added a brisk 25 runs off 12 balls but was dismissed by Kishore Mahato.The Pokhara innings faced consistent setbacks, losing wickets at regular intervals. Dinesh Kharel and Andres Ghosh, the openers, were dismissed for 10 and 16 runs, respectively. Rameon Reifer contributed 17 runs before being caught out off James Neesham.For Janakpur, Lalit Rajbanshi was the pick of the bowlers, taking three wickets for 31 runs in his four overs. James Neesham claimed two wickets, while Mohammad Mohsin and Kishore Mahato took one wicket each.This victory places Janakpur at the top of the table with six points, maintaining their unbeaten streak in the tournament. In contrast, Pokhara’s struggles continued as they succumbed to their second consecutive defeat.Later today, Sudurpaschim Royals will face Kathmandu Gurkhas in the second match of the day, scheduled to begin at 1 pm. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has returned home following a four-day official visit to China. He arrived at Tribhuvan International Airport on Thursday afternoon.The Prime Minister was seen off at Beijing Capital International Airport by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong. Oli had travelled to Beijing on December 2 at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang, leading a Nepali delegation.During his stay in Beijing, Prime Minister Oli met Chinese President Xi Jinping, where discussions focused on Nepal-China relations, mutual interests, and areas of bilateral cooperation. Several agreements were signed in the presence of Prime Ministers Oli and Li.Among the agreements signed were a memorandum for the construction of the Tokha-Chahare tunnel road and another to enhance Nepal-China trade. The Chinese government also handed over certification for the completion of the reconstruction of the iconic Basantapur-based Nine-Storey Palace in Kathmandu.Additionally, an agreement was reached on the export of buffalo meat to China, along with development projects, economic and technical cooperation, and cash assistance. Other significant agreements included the deployment of volunteer Chinese language teachers and a collaboration between Nepal Television and China Media Group on communication technology.Both nations also discussed promoting tourism, aiming to attract a significant number of Chinese tourists to Nepal by 2025. Furthermore, Prime Minister Oli extended an invitation to the Chinese Premier Li to visit Nepal.The Nepali delegation accompanying Oli included his spouse Radhika Shakya, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, prime minister's chief advisor Bishnu Prasad Rimal, economic and development advisor Yubaraj Khatiwada, parliamentarians, senior government officials, private sector representatives, and journalists. \nSudurpaschim Royals set a target of 168 runs for Kathmandu Gurkhas in their second match of the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL) at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Thursday.Electing to bowl first after winning the toss, Kathmandu restricted Sudurpaschim to 167 runs at the loss of six wickets in the allotted 20 overs.Sudurpaschim’s batting was led by Brandon McMullen, who scored a quick 53 off 31 balls, including three fours and four sixes. He partnered with Binod Bhandari (35 off 30 balls) for an 86-run stand for the second wicket before being caught off the bowling of Gerhard Erasmus.Skipper Dipendra Singh Airee contributed a vital 43 off 25 balls, hitting three fours and two sixes, before being caught by Michael Levitt off Karan KC’s delivery.Kathmandu’s bowlers were led by Rashid Khan, who picked up two wickets, while Karan KC, Sahab Alam, and Gerhard Erasmus claimed a wicket each.Kathmandu will need a strong batting performance to chase the 168-run target and secure their second victory in the tournament.In their respective opening matches, Sudurpaschim defeated Biratnagar Kings by 90 runs, while Kathmandu overcame Karnali Yaks by three wickets. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nThe dispute between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Janamat Party has escalated as they engage in public accusations against each other through statements.For months, the party has been trying to remove its lawmaker Goma Labh Sapkota from the position claiming she was involved in an irregularity. The Madhesh-based party has been writing to the parliament secretariat and Speaker Devraj Ghimire urging them to remove Sapkota as a member of the lower house.In November first week, the party wrote to Ghimire for the third time claiming she needs to be sacked as a lawmaker alleging that she had received bribes from a contractor and was also conspiring to split the party. Ghimire on November 21 turned down the request arguing the charges the party has leveled against Sapkota don’t lead to her disqualification for the lawmaker post.He said the Political Parties Act has prescribed the conditions when a lawmaker loses his/her position, but the allegations against her don't fall under the conditions.Angered with the decision, the CK Raut-led party not only accused Ghimire of engaging in “criminal conduct” but also claimed that his decision was racist and reeked of bigotry. Issuing a press statement on Monday, it said the decision to continue Sapkota’s position was discriminatory and against the parliamentary norms.“By invalidating the party's disciplinary action, the Parliament Secretariat not only violated the party’s supremacy but also, by acting as a partisan of a particular party, went beyond its jurisdiction, engaging in unlawful, unconstitutional, and criminal acts that jeopardise the multi-party parliamentary system and democracy itself,” the Janamat Party’s statement reads. “If the Speaker is allowed to act beyond his jurisdiction with such arbitrary power, it will set a dangerous precedent and pose a significant threat to democracy.”The party also accused Ghimire of not taking action against Sapkota because she is his relative and had committed to joining the CPN-UML (after splitting the party). Ghimire was elected as the Speaker from the UML.Just because someone is a relative of the Speaker or has pledged to join the Speaker’s former party, he cannot defend a lawmaker even though the party’s central committee has taken action against her following all due legal process, the statement further reads.Further alleging Ghimire, the party claimed that the Speaker has been demonstrating extreme racist and discriminatory behavior in the past, especially regarding issues like the use of language and attire in Parliament, in allocating time and in other parliamentary proceedings.A day later, on Tuesday, the parliament secretariat issued a statement taking a serious exception to the party’s allegation against the Speaker. Through the statement, Anant Prasad Koirala, assistant spokesperson at the secretariat, rubbished the allegations claiming that there has been no discrimination on the grounds of caste, ethnicity, colour, gender, community, language, religion, or physical condition.He said the party requested for Sapkota dismissal as a lawmaker citing in accordance with the Section 35(2) of the Political Parties Act but the allegations aren’t in line with the prescribed conditions for the lawmaker’s dismissal.“The federal parliament secretariat, upon receiving the letter, presented the matter in accordance with the provisions of Nepal’s Constitution and relevant laws (the House of Representatives Rules, 2079 and the Political Parties Act, 2073), and the Speaker has made a decision in accordance with the law,” the Secretariat’s statement said. “The secretariat wants to inform that all the details of the Speaker’s decision are clear and, as always, will ensure that all actions are carried out in accordance with the law.”Sapkota has been refuting the allegations of corruption and conspiring against the party. She has claimed that she is being targetted because she didn’t appoint her personal assistant as dictated by her party leadership. \nOn December 1, when by-elections were underway for 41 vacant local level positions across 32 districts in seven provinces, Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) President Rajendra Lingden claimed that his party could win big in the next general elections, citing growing public disenchantment with the big political parties.Speaking at the inauguration of the party’s municipal convention in Birtamod, Jhapa President Lingden said, “There is no alternative to the RPP in Nepal, and the party should move forward accordingly.” However, when the complete results of the by-elections came on December 2, the RPP failed to win any of the contested posts. It could secure only 26 votes in the election for chair in ward 6 of Kankai Municipality in Jhapa, also Lingden’s hometown. Similarly, in the election for chair in ward 5 of Molung Rural Municipality in Okhaldhunga, the hometown of the party’s general secretary, Rajendra Gurung, the RPP garnered just three votes. However, the party spokesperson Mohan Shrestha later claimed that Lingden’s December 1 remarks referred to the 2027 general elections, not Sunday’s by-elections.But not all RPP leaders agree with Shrestha. Although some of them admit that the RPP’s agenda is drawing public interest, they blame the by-election losses on the party’s poor strategy and call for introspection. “When smaller parties, like the CPN (Unified Socialist) and Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party managed to win local unit positions, the RPP, the fifth largest party in the House of Representatives, failed to attract public support,” an RPP leader said talking to the Post.The party’s poor show has prompted some leaders to question Lingden’s leadership.“The candidates for the by-polls were selected without a formal discussion in the party,” said one of the party leaders requesting anonymity. “It is the failure of the party chief, and he should take responsibility for the setbacks.” The leader also said the party had performed poorly in the last year’s by-elections for federal and provincial positions.Party spokesperson Shrestha, however, dismisses these claims and allegations, arguing that the party did not lose any local level seats it previously held. “There is no question of the party chief taking responsibility for the outcome,” he said, talking to the Post. Some party leaders, however, allege that Lingden’s arbitrary decisions have caused setbacks for the party on many occasions. They say that Lingden did bring changes during the 2021 general convention, but he has failed to maintain the decorum of a party chief.Lately, internal strife has also intensified within the party. In October, while party general secretary Dhawal Shamsher Rana was undergoing treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, India, Lingden removed him as head of the organisation department and replaced him with senior leader Buddhiman Tamang. Also, Lingden has changed the responsibilities of other senior leaders during the same period. “The party chief’s decision to replace the organisation department chief is tied to the party’s poor show in the by-polls,” a dissident in the party told the Post. The party’s another spokesperson, Sagun Lawoti, thinks the RPP should analyse the by-election results thoroughly. “It is high time the party introspected its strategy,” Lawoti said. Political analysts, meanwhile, say that the RPP's failure in byelections reflects the public’s lack of support for its agenda of reinstating Hindu kingdom. “RPP is clinging to a redundant agenda which has no traction with the people,” Mumaram Khanal, a left-leaning political analyst, said.Below is the RPP’s vote tallies in Sunday’s by-elections, according to the Election Commission website: \nAs the vote counting of the by-elections conducted to elect 41 local representatives is about to be completed, the Nepali Congress, the country’s largest party, has won the most seats. Still, the party will be far from happy. Nepali Congress candidates had, in 2022 local elections, won 29 of the 44 seats that had later gone vacant due to the deaths of the incumbents and other reasons. In the by-polls to fill these seats, the Congress is in line to win just 17 seats. The Congress won the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, and 16 ward chairs while it had won 29 posts in earlier elections. In the recent by-elections, the Congress had already won the two posts of district coordinating committees in Kailali and Okhaldhunga unopposed as no one filed candidacy against them.Retaining the mayor of Kirtipur has come as a big relief for the party.Both the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), the second and third largest parties in the federal parliament, respectively, have succeeded in adding to the number of their local representatives. Of the vacant seats, each won seven in 2022. Compared to last time, while the UML added three local representatives, the Maoist Centre added two. Congress General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma, who led the party’s by-poll campaign, said the results were different this time as the party contested the by-elections without any alliance. In the previous local polls, it had formed alliances with the Maoist Centre and CPN (Unified Socialist), among other fringe parties. “Although it seems that we lost some posts we had earlier won, the party members are in fact excited about the election results that we achieved with our own strength,” Sharma told the Post. The by-elections were held for one municipal mayor, two rural municipality chairpersons, four vice-chairs, one deputy mayor, and 33 ward chairs. Among these, the Congress had earlier won the post of Mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, and deputy mayor of Nalgad Municipality of Jajarkot.Likewise, it had won Gramthan Rural Municipality chairperson in Morang, Mahabu Rural Municipality chairperson in Dailekh, vice-chairperson of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality, Dolakha, and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura.Meanwhile, Maoist Centre candidates won vice-chairs in Sarkegad Rural Municipality and Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality. The Congress couldn’t retain at least 10 posts the party earlier won.The Maoists have now snatched away from the Congress Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang and Nalgad deputy mayor in Jajarkot. Likewise, the UML has won Mahabu Rural Municipality and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality.The UML has managed to retain its seven ward chairpersons but in different local units, and add a chairperson and two vice-chairpersons of rural municipalities. According to the Election Commission, UML candidate Jung Bahadur Shahi has won the post of chairman of Mahabu Rural Municipality in Dailekh.Similarly, Maoist Centre’s Namo Narayan Majhi has won the post of chairman of Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang.Maoist Centre’s Devaka Lamichhane has been elected as deputy mayor of Nalgad Rural Municipality in Jajarkot.Likewise, Sulochana Kumari Bhandari of the UML has won the post of Vice-Chairperson of Balmiki Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura. Her nearest rival was Pultisara Shahi of the Congress. Bhandari was earlier defeated by Maina Devi Joshi of the Nepali Congress in the 2022 local elections.The Maoist Centre did well in some places where local by-elections were held. Despite the Congress-UML alliance, the Maoist Centre won the post of vice-chair of Putha Uttarganga in Rukum (East). The Maoist Centre’s candidate Narapura Budha won the post securing 3,627 votes to defeat Kesh Kumari Tulachan of the UML who was backed by the Congress. The UML candidate Tulachan got only 2,128 votes. In the by-polls, the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party (NMKP) candidate won the post of chairperson in ward 4 of Tilagupha Municipality in Kalikot. The party’s Khadgaraj Shahi won the post with 143 votes, defeating Naishoba Shahi of CPN (Maoist Centre), who garnered 115 votes. The post was earlier held by the Maoist Centre. Besides Bhaktapur, the party also has a presence in places like Kalikot, Humla and Dailekh. The party also has ward chairpersons in some places of Dailekh.“Our party played a big role in raising political awareness in places like Kalikot, Humla and Dailekh even during the Panchayat period,” Prem Suwal, the federal lawmaker from the party, told the Post. Among the new parties that emerged in the November 2022 elections, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) won the post of chairperson of ward 16 of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC).RSP’s Rojina Shrestha left the candidates of traditional parties behind. The post was earlier held by the Congress. Despite the party’s poor performance in other parts of the country where the by-polls were conducted, Shrestha’s win in KMC-16 marks the party’s debut at the local level. Shrestha secured 2,902 votes against UML’s Laxmi Ratna Tuladhar who garnered 2,220 votes. The Congress candidate Devendra Pathak managed to secure 2,214 votes in the ward.The Maoist Centre had not fielded a candidate in ward 16 of KMC. Asked why the Congress candidate lost, the party’s vice president of Kathmandu unit, Santa Kumar Maharjan, said the ward was never a Congress stronghold.“This was a ward dominated by the UML earlier as well. When all ward members were from the UML, Mukunda Risal was the only candidate to be elected from the Congress. He became the chairperson,” Maharjan said. “Risal’s victory could solely be attributed to his charismatic leadership.”Except the RSP, other new political parties failed to win any seats. The Janamat Party, which has a strong presence in Madhesh Province and currently leads the Madhesh Province government, failed to show its presence at the local level by-polls. In the by-polls held for the post of ward chairperson in seven wards in Madhesh, the Congress and the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal led by Upendra Yadav won two posts each. The UML, the Maoist Centre and the CPN (Unified Socialist) one post each. Professor of Political Science Krishna Khanal, says that aversion to political parties played a role in this by-election. “You could say those who won in these by-elections achieved technical victories. Based on these by-polls, none of the parties can claim to have increased their internal strength,” Khanal said.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who reached Beijing on Monday on a four-day official visit, is set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Qiang on Tuesday. Following the meetings, several project agreements and instruments are expected to be signed, officials said.Sun Weidong, vice minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Nepali Ambassador to China Krishna Prasad Oli, and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song, among others, welcomed the Nepali delegation at Beijing Capital International Airport. Oli is leading an 87-member delegation that includes his spouse Radhika Shkaya, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, advisors to the prime minister, members of parliament, senior government officials, and businesspersons, among others.“Prime Minister Oli will hold a meeting with Xi, the president of the People’s Republic of China tomorrow [Tuesday],” said a statement issued by the Nepali Embassy in Beijing on Monday. “On the same day, the prime minister is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Li.”A Cabinet meeting on Sunday approved the prime minister’s visit to China, as well as projects and instruments to be signed during the visit. Besides meeting with the Chinese president and premier, Oli will hold talks with Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and will deliver a keynote address at Peking University. He will also address the Nepal-China Business Forum, jointly hosted by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), on Wednesday.Sunday’s Cabinet meeting also approved the signing of a memorandum of understanding on the Volunteers’ Chinese Language Teachers’ Programme, according to Minister for Information and Communication Prithivi Subba Gurung, the government spokesman. The MoU will pave the way for Chinese teachers to teach Chinese language in various Nepali schools. Details of the programme, such as the number of Chinese teachers and working modality, will be finalised by the Ministry of Education and its Chinese counterpart, according to a foreign ministry official.China is set to provide a one-time budgetary support of $20 million to Nepal. Another agreement to accept Chinese economic and technical assistance worth 300 million RMB was also endorsed by the Cabinet on Sunday.Observers are closely watching whether the framework for cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be signed during this visit. A revised BRI framework document, prepared by a four-member task force from the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, has already been forwarded to the Chinese side for its consideration. Although Nepal has received positive signals on the revised BRI document, it remains uncertain whether it will be signed during Oli’s visit, a foreign ministry official told the Post before flying to Beijing on Monday.During the visit, according to government spokesperson Gurung, some project-related agreements are also expected to be signed. These include construction of an integrated check post at the Korola border point; Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road; Tokha-Chhahre-Bidur Highway; and an agreement to complete the feasibility study of 220KV Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime cross-border power transmission line.According to Gurung, 0ther agreements include the construction of a friendship bridge in Kimathanka— Khandbari over the Arun river; construction of a multi-functional agriculture park at Chobhar; industrial park at the Korola border point; and agreement on commencing bone marrow transplant at BP Koirala Cancer Hospital. Also, a new development cooperation model for 2024–2028 between Nepal and China is also expected to be signed. During the visit, leaders and officials will engage in finalising the framework for BRI cooperation and some projects to be developed under it. The Nepali side has proposed a dozen projects to be executed under the BRI framework. Multiple officials involved in the negotiations with the Chinese told the Post that Nepal is seeking the release of pending grants announced by China since 2008 and wants to develop select projects.Similarly, an MoU will be signed between Nepal Television and China Media Group, which owns China Central Television (including China Global Television Network), China National Radio, and China Radio International.Some accords and agreements from previous visits including Araniko Highway upgrade, and the second phase of Kathmandu Ring Road expansion are likely to be signed after delegation-level talks between Oli and Li on Tuesday. Chinese assistance, including 100 electric vehicles, vans, and ambulances; and some cross-border infrastructure and connectivity-related projects, will also be discussed and signed during the prime minister’s visit, according to officials. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nThe Golden Thali, located within the Thamel Eco Resort premises in Thamel’s tourist hub, has been inaugurated.Initiated by tourism entrepreneurs Rajan Simkhada of Earthbound Expeditions and Mohan Lamsal of Makalu Adventures, in collaboration with the Chef Nepal team, the restaurant aims to serve authentic Nepali flavours. Designed to promote and showcase the cuisine of mid-hill regions of Nepal, Golden Thali represents the country’s diverse culinary heritage, according to the owners. The Golden Thali includes chutneys prepared using a traditional stone grinder, fermented pickles, fresh pickles, and more. All spices used in the thali are prepared on a stone grinder to ensure authentic flavours. The Golden Thali features 15 dishes, including meat and various other delicacies. Unlike other typical Thali restaurants in Nepal, the Golden Thali offers choices and customisation options.Customers can select from various lentils, including black, red, beans, and mixed lentils. Similarly, for the traditional dhido, options such as corn, wheat, or buckwheat are available. \nThe British College has announced its official approval as a Recognised Teaching Centre for the University of London’s MSc Professional Accountancy programme.This significant achievement underscores the college’s commitment to offering world-class education in professional accountancy and solidifies its standing as a premier institution in Nepal, the college said in a statement. In collaboration with The British Professional College, a Platinum Approved Learning Partner of ACCA, British College will now offer students the opportunity to pursue MSc professional accountancy. Prof. Mary Bishop, Executive Principal of The British College, stated: “This master’s programme offers a distinctive opportunity for aspiring accountants to obtain a comprehensive qualification that seamlessly integrates both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. It provides an advanced understanding of financial management, strategic decision-making, and professional ethics, equipping students to thrive in the competitive global marketplace.” \nDuring Covid, many farmers in western Nepal suffered a severe fertiliser shortage, and crossing to India over porous border points to bring them was fully restricted. A couple in Rupandehi made up their minds—to open an organic fertiliser plant.Months after the plan, Siddhartha Agrawal and Poonam Kumari opened a Grow More Fertiliser and Chemical plant in Kothawa of Rohini rural municipality-4. “We started producing and distributing Ratnam granulated organic fertiliser. It’s the first granulated organic fertiliser produced in Nepal,” said Siddhartha. “It’s the best fertiliser for the soil as it contains a balanced quantity of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, magnesium, iron, boron, and calcium, etc.”The company has invested Rs300 million in the plant spread over five bighas. The company aims to supply fertiliser to farmers' doorsteps.Farmers feel relieved as the production starts arriving in the market.“There is a mix of all materials essential to maintain soil health, as tests have proven. We believe using fertiliser helps grow agricultural output,” said Siddhartha.The investment comes as factories in the district are shutting down due to an economic slowdown. The factory initially targeted to supply fertiliser in Lumbini, Gandaki, Bagmati, and Madhesh provinces.“The factory’s production capacity is 200 tonnes daily. We will ramp up the capacity based on the market demand,” said Siddhartha, adding that the factory has been distributing the fertiliser by opening sales depots in more than 100 locations in the provinces.The factory has obtained production permits from the Lumbini provincial Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.Managing Director Poonam Kumari said they were motivated to open a fertiliser factory after observing a severe scarcity during the Covid pandemic.“After that, we started construction.”She said it took them a year to get government approval. “It took another year to test the fertiliser—it’s impact on plant growth,” she said. After the successful test, the production and supply began.The fertiliser targets vegetable cultivation—both rooftop and terrace farming. It can also be applied to paddy, wheat and maize, besides legumes like lentils.It is also suitable for cash crops like sugarcane and tea, said Poonam Kumari.The fertiliser is available in 5 kg, 25 kg and 50 kg packages. Multiple factors are behind the shortage of chemical fertilisers in Nepal—from lean inventories and poor supply mechanisms to faulty policies and international pricing factors. These cause chronic distress to the tens of thousands of farmers annually who face other risks like droughts, floods, and crop failure.Agriculture is the mainstay of Nepal's economy, employing around 60 percent of the total workforce and contributing 24 percent to the national economy.The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development has estimated that the annual demand for fertilisers stands at around 700,000 tonnes.However, the estimate is years old, and there has been no study to find the actual demand.A separate report by USAID, an international development agency, has shown that Nepal is highly dependent on smuggled fertilisers and estimates that nearly 70 percent of the 600,000 to 800,000 tonnes of the plant nutrients are improperly imported.An agricultural country, Nepal depends on fertiliser produced in other countries. “Not only that, farmers have to wait in long queues all day to get a bag of fertiliser,” said Siddhartha. “Nepal has been spending billions on fertiliser imports.”He hopes their output will be able to meet a sizeable market demand in the future.He said that compared to chemical fertiliser, Ratnam is cheaper and of more quality. “Our target is to replace chemical fertilisers gradually. Our production is getting huge demand from local farmers and even those in India.”A 50 kg diammonium phosphate (DAP) bag costs around Rs2,400 while Ratnam is priced at Rs1,200. “This is why we are requesting all to use Ratnam,” said Poonam Kumari.The factory currently employs 40 people. \nThe owner of a food stall in Vũng Tàu City in southern Việt Nam has been fined VNĐ125 million (US$4,900) and will have to suspend their operations for five months, in the wake of a massive food poisoning incident linked to the stall that affected over 340 individuals were affected by food poisoning, including one death.According to Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province’s authorities, the owner of bánh mì shop Cô Ba on Nguyễn An Ninh Street in Ward 7 was found guilty of several violations, including selling contaminated food and failing to meet food safety standards.On November 26, multiple customers who purchased bread from the bakery reported symptoms such as stomach pain, dizziness, nausea, and diarrhoea, including a 71-year-old man who tragically succumbed after consuming the food.The affected patrons were treated at local hospitals, and all have since stabilised and been discharged, according to local authorities.According to investigations, the food poisoning was caused by contaminated pork products and raw vegetables infected with Salmonella and E. coli bacteria.Food safety remains a pressing concern in Việt Nam, particularly among street food vendors who frequently flout hygiene regulations.In a similar incident last year, a popular bánh mì shop in Hội An town in the central province of Quảng Nam was heavily fined and suspended after over 300 individuals fell ill from consuming its bread, though no fatalities were reported.-In Association with ANN \nEminent city doctors and health experts today gave a call for caution, mass awareness and improved government policies to minimise the use of microplastics that can cause several health hazards, including cancer.Tiny plastic particles that are less than 5 mm are called microplastics and are being attributed to severe respiratory diseases or even some types of cancer. According to Dr Monidipa Mondal, an eminent radiation oncologist, when microplastics enter the body through food or other sources, they first encounter the immune cells. “Being micro-mini in size, they can easily enter the immune cells after which a biochemical agent called cyclophane is released. The cyclophanes prepare chronic information inside the cells. “As we know if chronic information continues to get stored in the cells, it can lead to cancer. Apart from this, cancer is also related to free radicals. Therefore, it also creates oxidative stress in the cells and free radicals in the cells due to which cell multiplication occurs,” informed the doctor.As reiterated by Dr Mondal, recent studies have revealed an increased number of colorectal cancers among people. “It has been found in some studies that microplastics could be a possible driver of colorectal cancer. Another observation reveals a link between breast cancer and microplastic. We have also heard about BPA-free plastic. BPA or Bisphenol-A is an agent that can mimic estrogen. In some cancer cases, estrogen has been found. It can, therefore, be said that if it can mimic estrogen, it could also be a possible cause of breast cancer,” she added.According to research by India Clean Air Network (India CAN), degraded plastic from waste and wastewater discharge due to inefficient treatment processes are two of the major sources of microplastics in West Bengal entering the human body in various ways. The health experts recommended stronger and improved government policies to curb the menace of plastic. As pointed out by Professor Sadhan K Ghosh, mass awareness, particularly among young students is the need of the hour. “The first need is waste segregation. Second, the governance should be such that microplastics are not created for which legislation and its implementation must be done. Also, as plastic becomes brittle and enters our body while swimming or is even consumed by fish that we eat, littering sea beaches should be prohibited,” pointed out the professor.-In Association with ANN \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has started providing ultrasound services free of cost to needy patients from its urban health promotion centres.Officials at the health department of the city office said that 10 out of 32 urban health promotion centres have already started providing services, and an additional five will also start the services within a month.“Any patient from any part of the country, if they are in Kathmandu metropolis, can receive the service,” said Deepak Kumar KC, chief of the health department of the metropolis. “We do not charge anyone any amount.”KMC officials said that ultrasound is a free basic health service the city office is committed to providing. However, patients must pay at least Rs400 for the services in the big hospitals and private clinics and hospitals charge additional amounts.Doctors recommend patients an ultrasound for various diagnoses, including finding the cause of pain and swelling, monitoring the growth and development of the fetus, and looking for blockages, among others.Officials say patients can bring prescriptions from other hospitals or doctors at urban health promotion centres for services.Along with ultrasound service, the city office has been providing physiotherapy services free of cost from all its 32 urban health promotion centres.The metropolis has also been working on setting up laboratories in all of its 32 urban health promotion centres.KC said that due to the lack of laboratory services in most urban health clinics, patients have been forced to seek services at state-run hospitals and private centres, which are often overcrowded and expensive. According to him, lab services will also be free to the patients.The city office runs 32 urban health promotion centres, one in each ward of the metropolis. The metropolis had recently opened vacancies to hire 108 staffers, including 32 physiotherapists, 29 lab technicians, four medical officers, five staff nurses, 10 radiographers, 10 pharmacy assistants, and 26 peons for the urban health clinics.The city office provides 98 types of essential medicines—for communicable and non-communicable diseases, including high blood pressure, diabetes, mental health, heart disease, asthma, cholesterol, and respiratory problems—free of cost.Patients with government health insurance can get over 300 types of medicines from urban health clinics, according to health officials.Earlier, KMC provided mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics at urban health promotion centres. Officials hoped the move would help hundreds of mental health patients in the city get timely treatment.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Although neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that many residents could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems including anxiety and depression, among others.Health workers say that many city residents, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination, and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not openly discuss their mental health issues.The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Currently, we have medical doctors in all 32 urban health promotion centres,” said Dr Dibas Neupane of the metropolis. “We have been working to make our health service more effective.”The city office has also started campaigns in its jurisdiction to raise awareness of health hazards. The health department has started deploying health workers in various wards to examine sugar, blood pressure, and kidney function. “We have prepared a calendar for the health campaign every month,” said Neupane. “Health workers will visit the densely populated areas at least eight days a month to examine the health condition of locals. We hope that campaigns will help make people aware of their health and inspire behaviour change.” \nDespite winter's arrival, dengue continues to spread in Nepal, with over 34,000 cases and 13 fatalities since January, putting an emphasis on prevention and early treatment.\nNepal Foods received the Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International for its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.\nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a five-day trout festival showcasing 12 unique dishes from various cuisines, celebrating the nutritional benefits of trout from Nepal's rivers and lakes.\nGrowing up in Nepal, the author's fascination with baking led to a series of mishaps involving an improvised chocolate cake and misidentified leavening agents, which later prompted a journey of research, trial-and-error, and an understanding of baking science and techniques.\nQueer individuals have historically faced discrimination and marginalization, but safe spaces like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu, founded after the Stonewall Riots, provide acceptance and a sense of belonging for the LGBTQIA+ community, promoting inclusivity and understanding within society.\nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York, established 'The Sewing Tin' supper club to promote Nepali cuisine while blending Nepali flavors with modern culinary techniques, showcasing his signature 'Confit Duck Chatamari'.\nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nIn a commanding performance at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, Sudurpaschim Royals emerged victorious over Kathmandu Gurkhas by 73 runs in their second match of the Nepal Premier League (NPL).After being called to bat, Sudurpaschim set a target of 168 runs with a score of 167/6 in their allotted 20 overs. Skipper Dipendra Singh Airee played a pivotal role, smashing 43 runs off just 25 balls, including three fours and two sixes. Brandon McMullen also impressed, scoring a brisk 53 from 36 balls, featuring three fours and four sixes. Binod Bhandari contributed a solid 35 off 28 balls, forming a crucial 86-run partnership with McMullen for the second wicket.Kathmandu Gurkhas’ chase got off to a shaky start, losing key wickets quickly. Naren Saud, who had just returned from the ACC U-19 Asia Cup in the UAE, delivered a match-winning performance with figures of 5/19 from 3.5 overs. His outstanding spell included four wickets in just 11 balls. Abinash Bohara also bowled economically, taking 2/12 from three overs, while McMullen and Saif Zaib each picked up a wicket.The Gurkhas were bowled out for 94 in 15.5 overs, with Stephen Eskinazi top-scoring with 37 runs from 35 balls, including five fours and one six. Other contributors included Sumit Maharjan (14), Bhim Sharki and Gerhard Erasmus, who each made 10. The rest of the lineup, including Michael Levitt (5), Shankar Rana (3), and Rashid Khan (2), struggled to build partnerships.Rashid Khan led the Gurkhas’ bowling with figures of 2/20 from four overs, while Karan KC, Shahab Alam, and Erasmus claimed one wicket each.Sudurpaschim Royals’ win follows their impressive 90-run victory over Biratnagar Kings in their opening match, while Kathmandu Gurkhas had previously secured a three-wicket win against Karnali Yaks in their second match. \nSyrian rebels ousted pro-government forces from Hama on Thursday, bringing the insurgents a major new victory after a lightning advance across northern Syria and dealing a new blow to President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies.The Syrian army announced that the rebels had entered Hama after intense clashes and said it was redeploying outside the city “to preserve civilians lives and prevent urban combat.”Rebels said they had taken districts in the city's northeast and had seized the central prison, freeing detainees.Al Jazeera television broadcast what it said were images of rebels inside the city, some of them meeting civilians near a roundabout while others drove in military vehicles and on mopeds.The rebels took the main northern city of Aleppo last week and have since pushed south from their enclave in northwest Syria, reaching a strategic hill just north of Hama on Tuesday and advancing towards the city's east and west flanks on Wednesday.Hama has remained in government hands throughout the civil war, which erupted in 2011 as a rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad. Its fall to a revived insurgency would send shockwaves through Damascus and its Russian and Iranian allies.The city lies more than a third of the way from Aleppo to Damascus and its capture would open the road for a rebel advance on Homs, the main central city that functions as a crossroads connecting Syria’s most populous regions.Inside Hama, the scene of an Islamist uprising that the Assad dynasty crushed in 1982, the internet was cut off and streets emptied on Wednesday according to a resident whose family remain in the city. \nSouth Korean opposition lawmakers said on Thursday they would vote this weekend to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his botched attempt to impose martial law, while the defence minister blamed for recommending the move resigned.Yoon’s declaration of martial law late on Tuesday sought to consolidate power, ban political activity and censor the media in Asia’s fourth-largest economy and a key US ally.It sparked outrage in the streets and concern among South Korea’s international allies.Lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Party planned to seek a vote in parliament to impeach Yoon at about 7 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Saturday, a party spokesperson told reporters.“The Yoon Suk Yeol regime’s declaration of emergency martial law caused great confusion and fear among our people,” Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Seung-won told the National Assembly earlier.Yoon’s ruling People Power Party is divided over the crisis but said it would oppose impeachment with the party in turmoil and two years left in Yoon's five-year term.The Democratic Party needs at least eight of the 108 ruling-party lawmakers to back the bill for it to pass with a two-thirds majority in the 300-seat parliament.Fighting for his political future, Yoon accepted the resignation of Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun on Thursday and nominated his ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Choi Byung-hyuk, as a replacement, Yoon’s office said.Kim had recommended Yoon declare martial law on Tuesday, according to the interior minister, a senior military official and the opposition’s filing to impeach Yoon.Kim also ordered the deployment of troops to the parliament, Vice-Defence Minister Kim Seon-ho said, adding that he was unaware of the martial law order until Yoon declared it.“I have fundamentally opposed the mobilisation of military forces under martial law and have expressed negative opinions about it,” Kim Seon-ho told a parliament hearing on Thursday, apologising and taking responsibility for failing to prevent it.South Korea’s army chief has also offered to resign, the Yonhap news agency said.The former defence minister now faces a travel ban as prosecutors investigate the attempt to impose martial law, broadcaster YTN said. Yoon and the interior minister were also being investigated, Yonhap said.INSTABILITY ALARMSJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Japan’s “security situation may be fundamentally changed” in light of the instability in Seoul and North Korea’s rising military assertiveness.“What will happen to South Korea? There appears to be a great deal of domestic criticism and opposition,” he told parliament, adding that Yoon’s efforts to improve relations with Tokyo “must never be undermined”.There has been no reaction yet from North Korea to the drama in the South.On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Reuters the United States had not been made aware in advance of Yoon’s declaration, while his deputy, Kurt Campbell, said Yoon had badly misjudged it.The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.The commander of US Forces-Korea, General Paul LaCamera, warned American troops to stay vigilant, avoid areas with protests, and tell superiors of travel plans in case “something unexpected” happens.Yoon had been embraced by leaders in the West as a partner in the US-led effort to unify democracies against growing authoritarianism in China, Russia and elsewhere.But he caused unease among South Koreans by branding his critics “communist totalitarian and anti-state forces”. In November, he denied wrongdoing in response to accusations of influence-peddling against him and his wife and he has taken a hard line against labour unions. \nBitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by sceptics as a coming-of-age for cryptocurrencies as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement cryptos' place in financial markets.The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record just shy of $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple alone is worth about $3.7 trillion.Bitcoin’s march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the concept of “decentralised finance” in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago.Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump’s sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress.Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday’s Asian morning, it was soon above $103,000 and was last fetching $103,335 .“We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital.“Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.”Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.“We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, US investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund.On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission.Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to \"develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms,\" and the Chamber of Digital Commerce.“Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem,” said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith.“We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation.”A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council.PART OF THE LANDSCAPEBitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns.Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed.Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally.US-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election.“Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money,” said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.“Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalised,” he said. “If you fast forward a number of years on trading floors you'll have a sales and trading desk...which will sit alongside FX and rates and commodities.”It is already becoming increasingly financialised, with the launch of bitcoin futures in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock’s ETF in November.Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and exchange operator Coinbase each up around 65% in November.Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies.‘WHO CAN PROHIBIT IT’The cryptocurrency industry has been criticised for its massive energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, and the underlying technology is yet to deliver a major revolution in the way money moves around the globe.Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: “Who can prohibit it? No one.” And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience.“As time goes by it's proving itself as part of the financial landscape,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney.“I find it very hard to value it ... it’s anyone’s guess. But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up.” \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nHindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das, a former member of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) and now a spokesperson of Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote, was arrested on charges of treason upon his arrival at the Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka. This has spiralled into a war of words, threatening to damage the existing bilateral relations between India and Bangladesh.Das was brought to a magistrate court in Chittagong on November 26 and was denied bail. A protest against the decision led to a violent clash between Das’s supporters and law enforcing authorities, where a lawyer named Saiful Islam was hacked to death, ensuing a blame game between the Monk’s supporters and his political opponents. Aftermath of arrestIn a statement by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on November 26, India expressed “deep concern”. It asked the interim regime to “ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities.” However, Bangladesh dismissed India’s concerns, and the country’s foreign ministry referred to India’s statement as “unfounded” and “misrepresented fact”, which stands “contrary to the spirit of friendship and understanding between the two neighbouring countries”. Since then, social media has been rife with nationalistic rhetoric of netizens against one other. Meanwhile, the flags of both countries were desecrated by protestors as if to score a nationalistic point over the other. However, the situation did not end there. As groups within India, supported by regional political leaders, gained ground, the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission office in Agartala was attacked. India issued a statement, describing the attack as “deeply regrettable” and promising action against those breaching the mission’s security. The bank accounts of Das and 17 members of ISKCON have been frozen. Bangladesh’s immigration police didn’t permit 54 group members from ISKCON to cross over to India despite having valid travel documents. There are demands in Bangladesh that ISKCON be declared a terrorist organisation. However, the Bangladesh High Court dismissed an appeal to ban the organisation.Issue of minority safetyAfter the fall of the regime, houses and properties of the minority community were targeted. According to reports, 1,068 homes and business establishments were attacked. There were reports about attacks on temples across the country. A gold-plated silver crown gifted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Jeshoreshwari Kali temple in Bangladesh’s Satkhira district was stolen. India expressed its concerns, and Modi spoke to the interim regime's Chief Adviser, Muhammad Yunus. Yunus visited Dhakeswari temple, assured the minority community of safety, and promised to take action against those who attacked them. But the violence continued. Some Hindus said they took help from their Muslim neighbours to protect themselves. In some cases, people kept vigil to protect temples. Some Bangladeshi politicians justify the event as an attack on “Awami-Hindus” as if they deserved it since they are perceived as supporters of the deposed regime. In 2001, Bangladesh witnessed similar violence by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters when the Awami League lost power to the BNP. Durga puja was celebrated in a lacklustre manner, and 35 puja pandals were attacked. In one of the places, Islamic music was played.As a result, many Hindus wanted to flee to India but were not allowed to cross the border. Such attacks on minorities also occurred during the Awami League period, but the scale of violence this time was massive. While Bangladesh media accused Indian media of “exaggerating”, it was silent on the magnitude of these attacks except for The Daily Star and Prothom Alo, whom the Islamists targeted for their reportage on the attack on minorities.Fallout of the Monk’s arrestSeveral hospitals in Tripura and West Bengal announced they won’t admit patients from Bangladesh. There were protests in Bangladesh against the attack on the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Tripura, so the country decided to close the Commission temporarily. Both countries have stepped up the security of their missions following the security breach in Agartala. Emotions are running high among the people on both sides. Statements by politicians have further fuelled the acrimony.The current relationship is vulnerable to domestic politics on both sides. Since the fall of the Hasina government, anti-Indianism has been influenced by vested interests in Bangladesh, seeking to recast its foreign relations while portraying India as a beneficiary of Hasina’s rule. Despite all these upheavals marked by high expectations, frustration and accusations, India has not accepted the change of regime in Dhaka. There is a new emphasis on the relationship with Pakistan as the interim government announced a re-examination of MoUs and agreements concluded with India. Revival of the SAARC has been proposed, while the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) has disappeared from the political lexicon.Border trade continues as usual, and there is a ray of hope in bilateral relations. The Home Minister of India inaugurated a passenger terminal building on October 27. Ten Bangladesh officers also came to India for Land Port Training under India’s Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme (ITEC) in October. When protestors from India threatened to disrupt trade following Das’s arrest, the Border Security Force and the Land Port Authority of India took measures by shutting the access to the border entry points. A meeting at the Foreign Secretary level is due next week.Bilateral relations are not founded on century-old socio-economic relations but on the reality of geography. Bangladesh remains India’s largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh’s second-largest trading partner after China. The two countries mostly trade essential food items. Moreover, India exports raw materials for Bangladesh’s garment industry, contributing 80 percent of the export earnings, which add up to 11 percent to the country’s GDP. Bangladesh and India must put the relationship back on track and take it forward. Irresponsible comments in the media create an atmosphere of a zero-sum game. This multifaceted relationship cannot be held hostage to any single issue, as India has underlined. It is time to take extreme caution to navigate this complex bilateral relationship as Bangladesh moves towards implementing institutional reforms that would ultimately pave the way for democracy, as aspired by the July uprising that unseated Hasina.  \nPrime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli chose New York as his first visit abroad to attend the 79th United Nations General Assembly. He held a 45-minute-long meeting on the sidelines with his Indian counterpart, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sharma Oli described the talk as ‘positive’. Modi termed it ‘very good’. Shorn of diplomatese, both statements implied that the meeting had failed to restore mutual trust between them.It took Premier Sharma Oli a while to get an invitation from his Chinese counterpart. The agenda of the visit had to be negotiated with the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the Pratinidhi Sabha that is keeping the government afloat. The chattering classes of Kathmandu were excited that Sharma Oli had chosen Beijing over New Delhi as his first official visit. The misplaced enthusiasm is meaningless: Beijing is politically hallowed for communists of all shades just as Banares is sacred for every pious Hindu.In any case, Nepal must be the only country where China and India are considered competitors. The Chinese economy is nearly five times bigger than India’s GDP. The military spending of Beijing is at least three times that of India. Ranked at 75, China is grouped high on the global Human Development Index (HDI) while India with its 134 score falls well below Bhutan and Bangladesh. Beijing and New Delhi aren’t in the same league.Geopolitical strategists in the capital cities of Nepal’s neighbouring countries are more fearful of Washington's intentions than those of each other. For a brief while in the 1950s, the United States worked with Indians to contain China and stop Beijing from spreading its wings in South Asia. Officially, the Ping-Pong diplomacy began in 1971, but a lot of hush-hush preparations must have been done earlier for the sudden thaw in the frozen relations.Once Chairman Mao Zedong shook the hand of President Richard Nixon on February 21, 1972, the balance of power in the world began to change irreversibly. Chairman Mao had found a stepping stone to emerge out of the well of seclusion that he had dug for the Chinese with his disastrous campaigns of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.Awakened dragonUnable to withstand the pressure of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness), the USSR’s downfall began with the fall of the Berlin Wall and gained momentum with the collapse of satellite regimes in East Europe. The greatest political experiment of what historian Eric Hobsbawm has called “the short twentieth century 1914-1991” completely disintegrated with the humiliating ouster of Mikhail Gorbachev. The contested concept of unipolarity did have its brief moment in the sun, but it soon dissolved when Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History? hypothesis was countered by his guru Samuel Huntington’s The Clash of Civilizations? formulation heralding the beginning of a multipolar world of contesting civilisations. Meanwhile, the Paramount Leader of China Deng Xiaoping had already started a modernisation drive in the 1980s with his oft-quoted command: “observe calmly, secure our position, cope with affairs calmly, hide our capacities and bide our time, be good at maintaining a low profile, and never claim leadership.” Exalted with the title of “core leader”, President Xi Jinping has built the structure of global ascendency on the ground that Mao broke with the help of President Nixon in the 1970s. President Deng laid the foundation with the cooperation of President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, and President Jiang Zemin erected a scaffold of export-led growth with the collaboration of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which culminated in China being admitted into the World Trade Organisation.Despite its status of being the technological giant and a military superpower throughout the Cold War, Moscow lacked the economic muscle to challenge the hegemony of Washington that had been institutionalised through the Bretten Wood Sisters—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group—that undergirded the global trade and industry. The legacy of the British Empire had left English as the lingua franca of a large part of the world. It helped establish Hollywood films, British publications and New York fashion as the desirable elements of the upwardly mobile lifestyle of the growing middleclass in the Third World countries. The financial hub had shifted from London to New York. The Silicon Valley in California had emerged as the nucleus of cutting-edge technology. Backed by enormous endowments, the Ivy League institutions were attracting the best and brightest of the world. All that the USSR had to offer in comparison was the theory of the inevitable collapse of capitalism. The Chinese began to grow out of all such illusions in the 1970s and have gone about building an alternative to the plutocratic capitalism of the Washington Consensus with their model of authoritarian capitalism based on the Beijing Consensus.Wounded eaglePresident Xi Jinping’s concept of “building a community with a shared future for mankind” is an outline of an alternative world order. The Chinese designs of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the BRICS grouping that has more members than the acronym can accommodate, the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) are aimed at what has been termed as “Making China Great Again”.Just as unipolarity is an oxymoron, multipolarity is merely a desire of emerging nations for a seat at the high table. Ultimately, they must coalesce around a country with the determination and wherewithal to offer an alternative to the existing world order. Even though the Russians hosted the 16th annual BRICS summit at Kazan, China was the power behind the throne of President Vladimir Putin. President Xi Jinping agreed “in principle to the suggestions made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi” at the summit, which is a signal to the world that India will be careful in future about encircling China on behalf of the US. The collective anxiety of the geopolitical and geoeconomic establishment in the US about the future of their unchallenged dominance for almost a century is understandable. The incoherence in the statements of President Donald Trump probably comes from the confusion of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) team that has little idea about the frustrations of many countries with American hegemony.President Trump was unintelligibly provocative—meaningless covfefe is but one example—in his first term. It seems his second stint is going to be stormier. He is promising punitive tariff hikes. That will hasten the triumph of China-centric and China-inspired Pax Autocratica over Pax Democratica. President Trump appears to be determined to complete the task begun by President Nixon in the 1970s.Premier Sharma Oli’s pilgrimage to Beijing is a sideshow. Chieftains from tributary states are often rewarded for their fidelity, and Sharma Oli is likely to comeback with enough lollipops to silence his critics at home. But Beijing will perhaps be more interested in asking that Kathmandu shift its primary loyalty from Washington to Beijing. Nepal’s diplomatic dilemma will be much more perplexing than occasionally flashing the China card at New Delhi to assert its sovereignty.  \nRecently, a 22-year-old man visited Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) to get his sexually transmitted disease status checked after having unprotected sex. He was to leave abroad for higher education the following day. Likewise, several months ago, a young man expressed his distress over the intense pain following a penicillin injection administered against syphilis disease. When questioned about his marital status, he stated that he only had a girlfriend with whom he maintained a regular consensual sexual relationship. He further mentioned that the sexual interactions were generally unprotected. As per the hospital (STIDH) data, the majority of individuals receiving penicillin injections for syphilis are between 20 and 40 years old, with nearly two-thirds of that group being in the 20 to 30 age range. It’s a surprising but concerning public health concern in Nepal. Unprotected sexual contact not only carries the risk of syphilis but also increases the likelihood of other infectious diseases such as HIV, Mpox (known as “monkeypox”), HPV, gonorrhoea, herpes, chlamydia, trichomoniasis and hepatitis B. Since syphilis does not immediately show severe symptoms, many people do not get tested and thus remain unaware of their infection. There has been a notable rise in youths seeking foreign employment opportunities in recent years. This mandates medical examinations and blood tests, including for sexually transmitted infections/diseases. Following this, information about the spread of syphilis in Nepal has surfaced. People who engage in unprotected sexual activities, especially with more than one partner, have a higher likelihood of contracting syphilis. A bacterium, 'Treponema pallidum', is responsible for the infection. The transmission occurs through vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse as well as during pregnancy and through blood transfusions. Syphilis has four stages. On average, symptoms appear within three weeks of infection. This is referred to as the first stage. Sores may appear on the genitals, vagina, mouth/lips, or anus. As the sores are painless, many do not notice them or tend to overlook them. If treatment is provided around this time, the infection can be prevented from progressing to the second stage. Even without treatment, the sores typically heal within three to six weeks. However, the infection will progress to the second stage. Small rashes can be seen on various body parts (including the palms and soles) a few weeks after the first stage. Since these rashes are not clearly visible or do not cause pain or itching, people usually do not pay attention to them. However, symptoms such as fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat and fatigue can occur. The infection will enter the next stage, known as the 'latent stage' if left untreated. As per the hospital data, the majority of youths are commonly diagnosed and treated for syphilis during this stage. There are no symptoms in the latent stage; however, the infection can persist in the body for years if left untreated. The disease then progresses to the ‘tertiary stage’. This can occur 10-30 years after the initial infection. In this stage, syphilis can affect or damage vital organs such as the nervous system, eyes, heart and ears. Regrettably, information about complications or deaths due to the “tertiary stage” of syphilis is not well studied/known in Nepal to date. According to research published in the journal BMJ Open in 2024, 94.5 percent of sexually active students were found to have had risky sexual behaviour (RSB) in Kathmandu. Nearly one-third of the participants were found to be engaged with multiple partners. The participants ranged from 18 to 32 years, with a mean age of 21. The study only focused on undergraduate students residing in hostels in Kathmandu. Thus, the prevalence of RSB among Nepali youths might be significantly greater than what the research indicates. There is a pressing need for further research into this issue.There are numerous instances where people’s travel has been halted upon testing positive for syphilis because evidence of “no syphilis” is considered a crucial health requirement in employer health assessments abroad. Although treatment can cure the disease, the markers for syphilis often remain in blood tests. This appears to put young people in a difficult situation, especially financially, as they may have already incurred significant expenses by that time.We cannot ignore the fact that syphilis is spreading at an alarming rate among young adults in Nepal. It can be inferred that having multiple sexual partners and engaging in unsafe sexual practices without proper awareness contributed to the growing prevalence of syphilis among Nepali youths. Establishing an environment that fosters open dialogue and education regarding \"reproductive and sexual health\" among young people could significantly mitigate the challenges of rising syphilis infection in the country.  \nIn under four months, tenth graders all over Nepal will appear in the School Education Examination (SEE). This is a time for students to focus on final preparations. Sadly, hard work alone won’t yield better results when the schools and curriculum fail to cater to their needs. Every year, when the results are out, many students have to endure crushing failure. However, as in previous years, the authorities have failed to learn from their mistakes. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is making baseless predictions of a 70 percent pass rate in the upcoming SEE. How will this be achieved in a country where pass rates have for years hovered below 50 percent?Among 464,785 students who appeared in the last SEE, only 222,472—47.87 percent—secured a Grade Point Average (GPA) above 1.60, which is necessary to study at a higher level. However, 242,313 students—52.13 percent—were categorised as non-graded. After the supplementary exams, over a third of them were graded, qualifying them to study in grade 11. Oli’s forecast is only plausible if the results improve by around 50 percent, which is unlikely. The grading system was introduced in 2016 to reform the examination system, focusing less on marks and more on interactive learning. But the hangover of the old School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exams persists. While the system has been upgraded, the teaching and learning are still the same. Schools are grappling with a shortage of teachers for major subjects like Science, Mathematics and English. Rural provinces like Karnali have suffered the most and some schools are hiring under-qualified teachers to fill the gaps. With teachers unable to address their problems, students have no choice but to rely on rote learning. To cope, the government is focusing on extra online classes. But such online classes for school students hold only symbolic value. In Nepal, fear has always been a tool for teaching and learning. Most schools do not foster an environment where students enjoy learning. This mentality also applies to how the education system views examinations like SEE. Students are put under pressure to perform well, as if it were a “do or die” situation. The shame of failure scars students for life. Some private schools take advantage of this fragile emotional state of students by enforcing mandatory tuition classes. Further, as schools in rural areas can’t complete the syllabus on time, it creates an opportunity for private tuition centres to generate profit as students migrate a few months before SEE to study in such centres. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres.Schedule 8 of the constitution gives local units the authority to manage school education. But the lack of a Federal Education Act, a must to implement constitutional provisions, is a big hurdle towards this laudable goal. Among its various flaws, the controversial Education Bill, registered in Parliament last year, fails to establish minimum criteria for establishing schools. The government must realise that the basics must be fulfilled before setting lofty goals. There must be mechanisms to recruit qualified teachers and retain them. It is also imperative to update the pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. The SEE marks the culmination of over a decade of schooling. Therefore, it is unfair to blame the students who have trusted the system for long. The poor SEE results are a direct reflection of the system’s failure. Whether we have the SEE or the SLC, the flawed education system will continue to jeopardise the future of hundreds of thousands of young students.  \nThe Nepal Premier League, which kicked off on Saturday, has taken the country by storm. Never before had a national-level tournament created such buzz among domestic and international audiences. Nepali cricket fanbase, who grew up watching the Indian Premier League, are now ecstatic to have their own truly international franchise league comprising no less than eight teams. The fact that people from different parts of the country are travelling to the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground to cheer on their favourite teams speaks volumes about the tournament’s mass appeal.The ‘Festival of Himalayas’ features big cricketing names like former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham, Dutch Michael Levitt, Namibia’s Gerhard Erasmus, and Australia’s Ben Cutting. Nepali cricketers—both national players and newcomers—will now get to rub shoulders with these global cricket superstars, which will greatly boost their confidence. The NPL will also hopefully offer these players enough financial incentives to pursue cricket as a profession. In fact, the recent all-format international success of the Indian national team is often attributed to the IPL, for some of the same reasons. The start of the NPL this year could thus mark a sea-change in Nepal’s success in international cricket. The league will have a global audience after getting the Star Sports Network, an internationally established TV network, as the official broadcaster; and after partnering with the Twenty-first Century Media Sports, a company that has managed many international events. They will help showcase Nepal as a global cricket destination. No wonder Nepali cricket fans are upbeat. As one fan placard during Saturday’s opening match between Janakpur Bolts and Biratnagar Kings put it: “No matter who wins it is the victory of Nepali cricket.”Done well, the NPL’s success will resonate much beyond the international sports scene. The vast majority of Nepali youths are looking to leave the country the first opportunity they get. They see no hope in their country. But when they see that cricketers and commentators and organisers from around the world are coming to their homeland to play as professionals, perhaps this feeling of disenchantment with their native country will go down a bit. Additionally, if Nepal can successfully pull off an international tournament like the NPL, there is no reason this welcoming country cannot host tournaments like the cricket Asia Cup. But there will also be challenges. The Cricket Association of Nepal has taken up the monumental task of organising an eight-team tournament. The association’s history of managing similar tournaments is checkered. For instance, the CAN-organised Nepal T20 League in 2022-23 was marred by controversies even before it kicked off due to allegations about match-fixing. The body has also faced criticisms for negligence, delayed payments and incompetence. Even in the opening match of the NPL on Saturday, the association failed to manage the crowd, which in turn led to injuries. The next day, fans were seen running on to the cricket pitch at the completion of a match. In order to maintain the integrity of Nepali cricket, it is vital to minimise such incidents. Hopefully, the CAN is learning with every match. The CAN must get the NPL right, for the tournament’s benefits are potentially limitless. The millions of international TV viewers of the NPL will get to see what a beautiful country Nepal is and this in turn could boost the country’s tourism prospects. The NPL itself, linked to a multitude of stakeholders, can create many profitable jobs, especially as other stadiums are built and the tournament expands to other parts of Nepal. Exciting times, indeed.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli heads to China today amid a heated debate on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). At the centre of the debate is an argument over whether Nepal should accept only grants to develop bilateral Nepal-China projects or such projects can also be built with loans. In the end, the two main ruling parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—decided that there would be no loan deals during Oli’s China trip. The Congress had been adamant that Nepal cannot afford any more loans and as such there was no question of adding a financial burden to the country. As things stand, 12 projects are lined up for signing. An agreement on the ‘BRI framework for cooperation’ is also likely, which, at least in theory, should add momentum to old and new bilateral projects. There are multiple readings of the two ruling parties’ disagreements on negotiating with the Chinese. In one, the Congress, as the biggest ruling party, played a dubious role by unnecessarily tying the prime minister’s hands before an important visit.Oli, in this reading, won’t have much to show at the end of the trip. Yet there can be an alternate and more charitable reading of the recent sequence of events—and one which will be more salubrious to the country’s interests. The BRI became so controversial on the eve of Oli’s China trip precisely because there was lack of clarity on what being a part of it entailed for Nepal. When the country signed up to the initiative’s framework agreement back in 2017, there was little debate even as grey areas galore. For instance, the document Nepal signed seven years ago is yet to be made public, fanning many speculations. In this context, the new debate on the kind of cooperation the country can expect under the BRI was much needed. Unlike in the past when they were querulous opponents, this time, as coalition partners, the Congress and the UML were forced to come to an understanding on the initiative. They did this through a four-member taskforce that carefully dissected the new China-proposed framework. The Nepali side has tweaked the new BRI framework document in line with the suggestions of the taskforce and sent it back to China for final approval. Nepal has long felt the need for a broad political understanding on vital foreign policy issues. Yet such an understanding has invariably been made a victim to top leaders’ never-ending jockeying for power. This time, the differences between the Congress and the UML over the BRI, and the wider debate it sparked, have helped the country arrive at a more nuanced position on how to engage with China, one of Nepal’s two most important foreign friends. The deals Prime Minister Oli locks up in Beijing matter. But, more importantly, the decision of the country’s two biggest political forces to devise a common platform on a vital foreign policy issue bodes well for Nepal. If and when Oli goes to India, perhaps the two parties can come up with a similar common position. And the same while dealing with other important foreign actors. The sum of these understandings can in turn form a solid basis for a more consensus based Nepali foreign policy. Perhaps this extrapolation is a little simplistic. But the goal of greater consensus looks more achievable today than it did even a week ago.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is preparing to visit China in the first week of December. It will be his first bilateral visit after assuming the office in mid-July. Nepali prime ministers generally go to New Delhi first. Sudheer Sharma, former editor-in-chief of Kantipur daily, has recently published a pair of books on Nepal-China relations—‘Himalpari ko Huri’ and ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’. He also frequently writes on Nepal’s relations with its two big neighbours. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Sharma on the eve of Oli’s China visit. Prime Minister Oli is all set to visit China next month. Many find it curious that he decided to go to Beijing first before visiting New Delhi. How do you see this development?Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have given high priority to visits and engagements with our two neighbours–India and China. This is natural. Generally, the prime ministers first visited India and then went to China. I believe Prime Minister Oli tried to do the same. We see regular engagements with New Delhi at various levels. Prime Minister Oli had met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in the last week of September. In August, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India and met Prime Minister Modi and her counterpart S Jaishankar, among other key officials there. But Delhi has yet to extend the invitation to the prime minister. So he seems to have decided not to defer his foreign visits for long and chose to visit Beijing first. We have to see this in two perspectives. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and he is also going to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even in the past, Oli developed good relations with Chinese leaders. So, there are expectations that he may make the visit fruitful. An equally important concern is whether this visit impacts our relations with the southern neighbour India. I think the prime minister should focus on implementing the agreements reached during his previous visits to Beijing and during Chinese leaders’ Nepal visits. He should be mindful of not irking the southern neighbour while reaching any agreement with the northern one. I believe the prime minister is conscious of this.India often seems anxious about Chinese involvement in Nepal. Do you see any risk of this visit increasing the distance between Oli and India?Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited China first after he became prime minister in 2008. Even in the past, some Nepali prime ministers including Tanka Prasad Acharya went to China on their first official visit. This is not unusual. The two prime ministers—Oli and Modi—recently met in New York. India doesn’t seem ready to intensify bilateral engagements with Nepal immediately. So it is natural for the prime minister to increase engagements with China, without taking any steps that could provoke India. We should stop seeking Indian signals when dealing with China, and vice versa. We should maintain parallel relations with both the neighbours without antagonising any side.In this context, what should be the prime minister’s priorities during his China visit?We have to end our chronic problem of signing agreements and not implementing them. We make announcements and forget them. There are also some infrastructure projects China pledged to develop but there is little progress. So the prime minister should draw the Chinese leadership’s attention and press them to complete the projects on time. Some important projects such as Mugling-Pokhara and Narayanghat-Butwal road upgradation by the Chinese side have been slow, causing hardships to people. Even such issues should be communicated to the political level. Also, there are several commitments made by the Chinese government but left unimplemented. This creates an impression that China makes big promises but doesn’t keep them. Prime Minister Oli often highlights the Tokha-Chhahare road upgrade project under Chinese support but there is no satisfactory progress. Progress on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) on Nepal-China cross-border railway is unclear as well. Nepal expected some substantive support from China to make the Pokhara international airport financially feasible. Some concrete steps are needed to operate this airport. There are reports that the government has requested China to convert the loan taken to develop the airport into a grant and the prime minister will push for this during his visit. It will be an achievement if the prime minister succeeds in this. In the course of writing your recent books, you extensively interacted with Chinese officials and experts, as well as with their Nepali counterparts. What are the major factors delaying the projects? Is it lack of preparation on the Nepali side or is there any problem on the Chinese side?First, we [Nepalis] sign agreements but don’t work seriously to implement them. This is true in the case of agreements with other countries as well. We are negligent. Red tape is another problem. Third, China gives less priority to small countries like Nepal as it has so many big issues with other countries. We have to constantly follow up with them to speed things up. In the past, the two sides agreed to open more border points. This should be expedited. The people-to-people relations on the border areas were historically based on social interactions at the community level. People used to trade, marry those from the other side and interact in various ways. Of late, despite progress on infrastructure development, social engagement has been hindered. This should be rectified and new border points should be opened at Dolpa, Mustang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Taplejung, and Sankhuwasabha. We should think beyond the Capital-centric approach. This will help strengthen relations at the people’s level and give alternatives in our connectivity. We should put connectivity at the core of our relations with the two neighbours. In the past decade, we have made good progress in improving connectivity with India. A study report has been prepared on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway project. We are building an expressway linking Kathmandu and the southern belt of the country. Integrated check posts (ICPs) have come into operation along Nepal-India border points. Cross border electricity transmission lines have been built and we have increased energy trade with India. We have thus progressed in deepening connectivity with India. We lack reliable north-south highways. Therefore, the prime minister should make connectivity a major agenda of his China visit. Given the lacklustre performance of past projects, can we be optimistic about big cross-border infra projects under Chinese help?Nepal and China have committed to run some projects under the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) concept. A key component of this concept is to upgrade connectivity between Kathmandu and Kerung that includes roads as well as a railway. The concept also envisions operating other border points. The railway project requires more study and investment and needs to consider various other factors. For now, we should prioritise opening the aforementioned border points. The Korala border point at Mustang has huge potential. Nepal is making a road that connects Mustang with the Sunauli border point with India. Centuries ago, people from Banaras used to travel to Tibet via Mustang through this route. It can be revived and made a trilateral trade route between Nepal, India and China. Similarly, Limi in Humla, Olangchugola in Taplejung, among others places, can be developed as alternative routes. As far as Kerung-Kathmandu connection is concerned, let’s first give priority to building a reliable highway. The railway project should be developed with a broader understanding between Nepal, India and China. Beijing will develop such a big project only with the big Indian markets in mind. More importantly, there are some signs of improvements in India-China relations. We have to use this as an opportunity.There are differences in the way we work and the Chinese do and there are systemic and linguistic differences as well. These factors are often blamed for lack of progress in development activities carried out with Chinese support. Can Nepalis work closely with Chinese, just like we do with Indians?Until a decade ago, several projects developed under Indian support were left in limbo. In 2015, India imposed a blockade against Nepal and that sparked anti-India sentiment. Then, India expedited several projects. This drastic change became possible as the political leadership in India realised its mistake and showed the commitment to improve things.But the same thing is not happening with China because there is a “great wall” between Nepal and China when it comes to understanding each other. The Chinese haven’t understood Nepali context. The northern neighbour should be more open and liberal in helping Nepal. Second, Nepal should also stop approaching China only when our relations with India sour. We have left this impression on the Chinese psyche. First, we should be clear about what exactly we want from China, forge consensus among major political forces and hold talks with the Chinese leaders. Then, we should be equally committed to implementing the agreements reached this way. People now take announcements of building big projects under Chinese support as propaganda. Therefore, this time the prime minister should stress on pushing the pending projects. The prime minister should tell them that even the projects announced during President Xi’s visit have not progressed and that has created a bad impression of China in Nepal.There are some differences between the coalition partners—the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress—about the funding modality of projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). Do you think this may cause a problem?The UML wants to expedite the BRI projects while the Congress has insisted that we should accept only grants and not loans under the BRI. The prime minister should clear such dilemmas and come up with common views before he leaves for Beijing. Once they come up with a common view on such key issues, it will give a positive and strong message. The Chinese side will take it more seriously because the strong government led by the two largest parties can implement bilateral agreements.We have instances of Nepal’s political parties standing for and against important projects funded by other countries. This was seen in the case of the US-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and China’s BRI. Moreover, in the past, the Chinese leaders created an impression that they preferred working with communist parties and leaders. This is neither in the interest of Nepal nor of China.There are also discussions on signing the BRI implementation plan during the visit. What are the things Nepal should be careful about while signing BRI-related agreements?Trying to get grants instead of loans is in itself good. But there is no need to be prejudiced against the BRI per se. Nepal reportedly wants to include some points specifying waivers in specific projects. We should be very careful while signing project-based agreements. For instance, what will be the conditions and funding modality of a project, will it be developed under grants or loans etcetera. All our technical experts and other brains should be engaged while signing project-based agreements and specifying conditions and other nitty-gritty to ensure that we will not have unnecessary liability and debt burden in the future. Over time, Nepal has rightly adopted a steadfast position saying that we don’t join a strategic alliance proposed by any country. It stayed away from the US government’s State Partnership Programme (SPP) and China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI) as well as from India’s security umbrella. But we can’t be isolated in development initiatives. We have to take support from India, China, the US and other countries based on our needs.Do you think the Chinese side will show magnanimity on Nepal’s requests, for instance on waiving off the loan to develop Pokhara international airport?Though the Chinese ambassador to Nepal last year claimed the airport project to be under the BRI, the case is different because it was signed years before we joined the BRI. And, converting that loan into a grant is not a big deal for China. They should show magnanimity given the support we have been providing to China for a long time. If you see things historically, Nepal has helped China by suppressing Khampa revolt, preventing free Tibet movements on our soil and showing a steadfast commitment to One-China policy. China, which is now prosperous, should definitely show magnanimity and waive off loan of Pokhara airport. They shouldn’t see relations with Nepal through a purely transactional lens.In your book, you describe 2008 as a watershed after which the engagements between Nepal and China increased drastically. But why couldn’t we benefit from the northern neighbour in terms of development?The Chinese side looks more interested in increasing engagement. They like to showcase their development before foreigners. But more than lavish hospitality, we need substantive support from the neighbour, which has emerged as the world’s second-largest economy. But we should be clear about what we want from our engagements with China.  The Nepali side doesn’t present its proposals clearly. On certain issues, our politicians give mixed signals. This time, if this government of two largest parties reaches a certain agreement with China and remains committed to implement it, other forces can’t hinder it. The same approach can be replicated while dealing with India, the US, Japan or other friendly countries.Is difficult geography still a barrier in developing cross-border infrastructure projects and deepening relations between Nepal and China?In our textbooks we read that the Himalayan range is a natural barrier between the two countries. In my book ‘Bhikshu Byapar ra Bidroha’, I have explored and described how people from Nepal and northern India had been traversing through these mountains and there were interactions and engagements between the people in this part of the world since the 5th and 6th centuries. So, the mountains weren’t barriers even at that time. Now technology has made things easier. We have to think about how to connect with these two big economies. We have multiple east-west highways. Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries. \nOn Thursday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi and Gandaki Province.
