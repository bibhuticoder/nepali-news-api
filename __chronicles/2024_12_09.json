Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAs the CPN (Maoist Centre) gears up to bring Nanda Bahadur Pun, Nepal’s two-term former Vice-president, into active party politics, the move has reignited the longstanding debate over whether former Presidents and Vice Presidents should rejoin politics.Earlier, former President Bidya Devi Bhandari was said to be considering returning to active politics, but this has yet to materialise. Bhandari relinquished her party role as vice chair when she became the country’s first female President. According to Maoist Centre leaders, the party is also considering involving Amik Sherchan, a former provincial head, in active politics. Sherchan, however, said the party is yet to discuss the matter with him. “Whether people who have previously held constitutional positions like President, Vice President, and Provincial head can join active politics should be decided only after a vigorous debate,” Sherchan said.“You occupy the constitutional position by relinquishing party membership. So after completing your constitutional role, should you be allowed to return to the party’s fold?” Sherchan told the Post. “What precedent do we want to set? We need to consider these questions.” While Sherchan says there has been no official discussion on his return to active politics, Pun, the former Vice-president, claims that he has already rejoined his former party. According to Maoist Centre leaders, Pun has been participating in many party functions and events, and a formal announcement will soon be made. There are multiple examples of leaders returning to politics after completing their tenures in high state offices. But a Maoist Centre leader says this should not be allowed in the case of former Presidents, Vice-presidents, or even Provincial heads.“If we make such decisions, other political parties could follow suit, which may backfire for our party in the long run,” the leader said on the condition of anonymity. The leader believes such a practice should be discouraged to preserve the democratic spirit even though the constitution does not explicitly prohibit it. A section of the Maoist Centre also believes that by bringing back Pun, party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who of late has enjoyed good relations with former President Bidya Devi Bhandari, is trying to facilitate her return to the CPN-UML. “Former President Bhandari, who is trying to return to active politics, however, is facing hurdles, as her possible return came to be widely criticised, including by UML leaders,” another Maoist Centre leader said on the condition of anonymity. “Bringing back Pun, who was Vice-President when Bhandari was the President, can smoothen her way into the party politics.” If Bhandari rejoins active politics and becomes the UML head, Dahal might consider unifying the Maoist Centre and the UML, as happened in 2018. The Nepal Communist Party, born of the merger, split in 2021. However, Maoist Centre Secretary Ram Karki says when people are clamouring for new faces in politics, old faces rejoining politics will be meaningless. “Even a unification of the UML and Maoist Centre will have no impact on the communist movement, as neither party is truly communist anymore,” Karki said.Mahesh Bartaula, the UML chief whip, says it is up to the respective former President or Vice-President to make the call, as there is no constitutional bar. “That being the case, I also need no need for one former politician to facilitate the re-entry into politics of another former politician,” Bartaula said. Maoist Centre politburo member Yubraj Chaulagain denies that the party is considering bringing back Pun into active politics in order to help Bhandari. But he believes that should the party make such a decision, it could set a bad precedent. “The Maoist Centre should not make such decisions that could have long-term repercussions for the party,” Chaulagain told the Post. “Other parties could benefit from the Maoist Centre's decision by using it as a justification for similar moves that may be unpopular or controversial, but serve their own interests.”Chaulagain said there had been no such discussions in the party on the issue. Bhandari and Pun became the country’s President and Vice-President soon after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. They held their positions for almost seven years before Ram Chandra Paudel and Ram Saya Yadav, respectively, succeeded them in early 2023. Nepal’s Constitution does not explicitly bar a former head of state from engaging in active politics after leaving office. However, constitutional experts say this is a matter of moral ethics. “In other countries, former heads and deputy heads of state do not return to active politics. It is a question of ethics,” Raman Shrestha, a former attorney general, said.But some Maoist leaders believe Dahal is trying to bring Pun into active politics to strengthen his own position in the party. Deputy general secretaries Barshaman Pun and Janardan Sharma, who used to be stalwarts of Dahal, have now become harsh critics of the party leader. They even questioned Dahal's working style and raised the issue of leadership transfer within the party. Maoist Centre chair Dahal has long been navigating internal conflicts, using strategic manoeuvres to maintain control. Earlier, he played rivals Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya against each other. When Bahattrai and Baidya left the party, Dahal played Barshaman and Janardhan against each other, but this too did not last. During the party’s standing committee meeting in August, deputy general secretary Barshaman and Janardhan stood against the party chair. A Maoist leader said that to counter the growing challenge within the party, Dahal is considering giving former Vice-preisdent Pun an important role. The possibility is that former vice-president Pun will be given the role of senior-vice-president, said the leader. “Chairman Dahal does not want to lose the majority in the party. He is trying to gain control in various ways, including by bringing back Pun and Amik Sherchan,” another party leader said on the condition of anonymity.  \nNepal appears desperate to build a multi-million dollar cross-border liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline project and has started serious homework for the same.However, there is a paradox in the policy.Nepal is also preparing a 12-year plan to boost energy production and expand the market. The target is to produce over 28,000MW of electricity by 2035.Electric stoves are considered safer than LPG stoves as they do not have an open flame or combustible fuel source. The clear winner, however, will be LPG, as, according to experts, politicians have been lobbying for the gas pipeline without proper homework on the future of hydro and its investment.Nepal's petroleum import bill stood at Rs337.34 billion in the last fiscal, of which Rs55.61 billion was spent on cooking gas.Last week, Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari visited New Delhi, India, where a discussion was held on building a cross-border gas pipeline with Hardeep S Puri, India’s Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas.The ministers agreed ‘in principle’ to move forward with the project.Nepal has already chosen a site in Sarlahi, and the pipeline will come there from Motihari, India. “Once the project’s estimated cost is finalised, the two governments will decide on the funding modality,” said Baburam Adhikari, joint secretary of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. Nepal had requested the Indian government to build the LPG pipeline on grant. However, insiders say, as in the case of petroleum supply, Nepal should sign a long-term LPG supply agreement with India to make the project viable.If the government pushes for the LPG pipeline, what will be the future of hydropower, and what will happen to the government plan to use hydroelectricity in households?“That’s is not a good idea,” said Ganesh Karki, president of the Independent Power Producers’ Association, Nepal. The government should instead focus on increasing the country's power production and its domestic consumption, he said.Experts say reducing LPG imports by around Rs50 billion will help narrow the ballooning trade deficit.“We should not be dependent on LPG from India. We need to reduce its imports by prioritising electricity consumption,” said Karki.“Such LPG pipeline projects will take Nepal nowhere. We are spending billions to import LPG, which will obviously impact Nepal’s hydropower development,” said Karki. “If we promote fossil fuels and LPG imports, why would investors inject funds into hydro development?”The industry ministry and Nepal Oil Corporation officials say India is positive about supporting the construction of the Motihari-Sarlahi LPG project.Nepal buys all of its cooking gas from India, supplied by gas bullets.Nepal has been approaching India for the LPG pipeline construction since 2015 when the southern neighbour imposed a trade blockade.The India blockade, which began on September 23, 2015, and lasted about six months, was an economic and humanitarian crisis that severely affected Nepal and its economy.The cross-border LPG and oil pipelines were envisaged when Nepal suffered from an acute power shortage.In January 2015, the then Commerce Minister Sunil Bahadur Thapa and then Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan of India agreed to send an Indian technical team to Nepal to study the feasibility of setting up LPG and natural gas pipeline infrastructure from India to Nepal.Construction on the project began in April 2018 and was completed in April 2020.Now, with a hydro energy surplus, Nepal no longer needs an LPG pipeline, warn hydro investors.Observers say the LPG pipeline project could make Nepal more dependent on fossil fuels. In the coming years, the country will have abundant renewable energy to power the transport sector as well as energy-efficient electric stoves in its kitchens.An energy expert working on a government project, who wished not to be named, told the Post in August that building an LPG pipeline is another blunder. “Nepal will soon see a considerable amount of electricity generation that could substitute cooking gas and reduce trade deficit.”Environmentalists, too, have been saying that Nepal’s private sector is aggressively investing in hydropower, and the government’s investment in petroleum infrastructure could be a setback for them and the country.The government also has a goal of installing 500,000 improved cooking stoves, primarily in rural areas, and an additional 200,000 household biogas plants and 500 large-scale biogas plants.Nepal’s strategy is to have electric stoves as the primary cooking method in 25 percent of households by 2030.To meet this target, Nepal would need to invest $25 billion, according to estimates.According to Nepal’s National Statistics Office, among the 6.66 million households in the country, 51 percent use firewood and 44.3 percent use LPG in their kitchens.Among other types of cooking fuels, 0.5 percent of the families use electricity, 2.9 percent use dung cakes, 1.2 percent use biogas and 0.1 percent use kerosene or other fuels.Bagmati province, which contains Kathmandu Valley and has 1.56 million households, leads in LPG consumption, with 69.8 percent of the families using it for cooking.Besides the proposed LPG pipeline, in August, Nepal and India agreed on projects for an oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa, a greenfield tank terminal in Charali, and on an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan. \nNepal has banned additional three hazardous pesticides—paraquat dichloride, chlorpyrifos and phorate—which are not only being used to kill pests but are also being misused for suicide.“The Pesticide Management Committee has decided to prohibit the production, synthesis, export, import, transport, commercial use, storage, and sale of the said pesticides in the country,” reads the order published in the Nepal Gazette on Thursday.Poison ingestion, mostly involving pesticides, is the second leading cause of suicide in Nepal after hanging. According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 952 people killed themselves by consuming poison in the fiscal year 2023-24. “Poison is easily available in every household in rural areas across the country, as farmers often keep it in the house to use in crops,” said Dr Dilli Ram Sharma, former director general at the Department of Agriculture. “These hazardous substances are easily available in agri-veterinary shops and are not only being used in plants but also for suicide in our country.”Earlier, in 2018, the country banned eight pesticides—carbofuran, dichlorvos, triazophos, carbaryl, benomyl, carbosulfan, dicofol, and aluminum phosphide. Following the ban, suicides by poison ingestion have dramatically declined, according to Nepal Police report.Police data show that 1,320 people died by poison ingestion in 2018-19, the year authorities banned eight pesticides commonly used for suicide. The numbers dropped to 1,136 in 2019-20; 1,276 in 2020-21; 1040 in 2021-22 and 932 in 2022-23. Sharma said that traders can sell their existing stock of banned poisonous substances for up to two years, but cannot import more.“These pesticides are so hazardous that they can cause cancer, paralysis, renal failure, heart diseases in children, and deformities in newborn babies if used for a long time,” said Sharma. “Many countries, including India, have banned these pesticides.”After the ban on aluminium phosphide in 2018, people in crisis began ingesting chlorpyrifos, which is widely available on the market. Studies show that banning highly hazardous pesticides is a cost-effective and affordable intervention to reduce suicide rates. Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates. The country witnessed an alarming rise in suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year. “Restricting access to commonly used hazardous pesticides will help reduce deaths from suicides,” said Dr Rakesh Ghimire, principal investigator of Nepal for the Center for Pesticide Suicide Prevention at the University of Edinburgh of the United Kingdom, which has been carrying out research on suicides by poison ingestion in Nepal. “Many people who are in a moment of crisis can change their minds if they do not have access to poisonous substances.”Studies show that a ban on a few highly hazardous pesticides in Bangladesh, South Korea, and Sri Lanka, among others, led to sharp reductions in overall suicide rates. Pesticides are commonly used to get rid of insects, fungi, weeds and diseases which damage plants and crops. Every year more than 1,300 metric tons of 135 types of pesticides, including insecticide, fungicide, herbicide and biopesticide, are brought into Nepal, according to the Plant Protection Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.Doctors say high levels of pesticides in fruits and vegetables cause nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dizziness and anxiety. Long-term consumption of fruits and vegetables with high levels of pesticides can lead to kidney failure, lung disease and mental health problems, and can even cause cancer. According to health experts, the consumption of such fruits and vegetables may also affect pregnant women and harm the foetus. \nNepal and China signed a Belt and Road Initiative Framework Cooperation agreement, outlining principles, objectives, and implementation mechanisms for future projects involving grant aids and project-specific financing.\nRSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, arrested for fraud and money laundering, transferred to Birgunj for further investigation along with Chhabilal Joshi, accused of embezzling funds from Birgunj cooperative.\nUS Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu met with Nepal's Deputy Prime Minister to discuss US economic assistance, MCC implementation, and USAID-supported initiatives.\nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has lodged a complaint at the National Human Rights Commission seeking its intervention in protecting the human rights of its president, Rabi Lamichhane, a two-time home minister.The fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives has been accusing the KP Sharma Oli government of misusing the state apparatus to harass and defame Lamichhane. In the complaint lodged at the constitutional human rights watchdog, the party’s acting general secretary, Kabindra Burlakoti, has accused the state machinery of engaging in media trials against his party chief and vilifying him as a criminal while he is just an accused so far.“They are providing secret documents to various media outlets to create a negative public image of Lamichhane,” the complaint reads.The party has claimed that the only intention of the abrupt transfer of its president from Chitwan to Pokhara on Thursday midnight without prior notice was to torture him. Lamichhane, who was transferred to Chitwan from Pokhara to record his statement on cooperative fraud charges, was taken back at 11 pm on Thursday without allowing him to sleep, the complaint states.The police, however, have been claiming he was transferred at night after a security assessment. Ever since he was taken to Chitwan, the party cadres had been resorting to protest against the arrest. At least a dozen people, including police personnel, were injured in the clashes on Thursday afternoon.“The police have been torturing Lamichhane on different pretexts,” reads the complaint. “His personal diary, too, has been confiscated by the police in a blatant violation of privacy rights.”Through the complaint, the party has demanded the commission’s immediate action to protect his fundamental rights. Demanding a fair investigation on the matter, the party has asked the commission “to ensure proper actions are taken against the culprits.” It has also urged the national human rights watchdog to become proactive in protecting human rights and ensuring the rule of law.The officials at the commission say they have already asked their Pokhara regional office to investigate the matter. “We are also inquiring with the Nepal Police top officials to learn whether they directed the Chitwan police to transfer Lamichhane at midnight or was the decision of the local police after analysis of the situation there,” Yagya Adhikari, a joint-secretary at the commission, told the Post. “We will investigate the matter fairly and come up with a report.”Along with the RSP, leaders from other opposition parties have also started raising questions over “never-ending” custody against Lamichhane. After meeting him in police custody in Pokhara on Saturday, Rastriya Prajatantra Party chief whip Gyan Bahadur Shahi claimed that the police had treated him inhumanely. “There is no reason to keep him in custody for so long,” Shahi said. “It is clear that the government is biased against him.”Nepal Samajbadi Party chair and former prime minister Baburam Bhattarai and Rastriya Prajatantra Party (Nepal) chief Kamal Thapa, among others, have raised similar concerns in the past. Arrested on October 18 from the RSP office in Kathmandu, Lamichhane has already spent 51 days in custody. On Sunday, the Kaski District Court granted permission to the police to hold Lamichhane in custody for four more days to continue investigating cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering allegations against him.This is the latest remand extension, following previous approvals of six, seven, ten, thirteen, and fifteen days for police to conduct inquiries.Alongside Lamichhane, the court extended the remand for former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, Leela Pachhai, and Ram Bahadur Khanal, who face similar charges.Lamichhane and Rai have been accused of misappropriating Rs142.9 million from Supreme Cooperative and diverting it to Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd. Investigations indicate Lamichhane had borrowed Rs19.6 million in personal loans from the cooperative.Further probes revealed that Gorkha Media Network’s vice chairman, Joshi, took an additional Rs24.5 million loan, which was transferred to Gorkha Media’s Global IME Bank account. Records show Supreme Cooperative’s manager, Sagar KC, authorised a loan voucher for Lamichhane, with Roshani Gurung allegedly moving funds into Gorkha Media’s account. Gurung has since been released on bail, while Cooperative chairman Om Prakash Gurung remains in custody.An investigation into Supreme Cooperative revealed that Rs780 million of members’ deposits had been diverted to other organisations. Along with cooperative frauds, Lamichhane is being investigated on organised crime and money laundering. \nThe Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) on Monday filed a corruption case against Surya Prasad Silwal, chairperson of Nepal Insurance Authority, accusing him of misusing his position, submitting false documents, and carrying out fraudulent practices.According to CIAA Spokesperson Narahari Ghimire, Silwal manipulated official documents, including citizenship and passport records, to alter his date of birth, enabling him to extend his tenure and receive undue benefits. Despite reaching the mandatory retirement age of 66 on July 31, 2023, Silwal allegedly continued in his role, misusing his position and enjoying state-sponsored privileges for an additional nine months.The investigation revealed discrepancies in Silwal's documents, citizenship and academic records and passport application. His citizenship issued by the Parsa District Administration Office on March 7, 1976 indicated he was 16 years old at the time. However, another citizenship copy from Kathmandu Administration, issued on April 30, 2009, recorded the date of his birth as November 8, 1959. Similarly, Tribhuvan University transcripts mentioned July 30, 1958 as his birthdate.Silwal falsified the date of his birth as November 9, 1961 to obtain diplomatic and special passports.CIAA argued that Silwal’s actions breach sections 15 and 16(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002 and demanded the recovery of Rs3.66 million which Silwal allegedly received in salaries and benefits since July 31, 2023. The chargesheet was filed in the Special Court, Kathmandu, on Monday.Silwal, who had retired on July 30, 2016 based on the official birthdate of July 30, 1958, reportedly altered his records to continue his service. \nProvincial assembly parliamentary committees are pivotal to strengthening federalism in Nepal. These committees work to hold provincial governments accountable. Even when the assembly is not in session, the committees can continue working. As the provincial assemblies cannot manage all the tasks, these committees, with various thematic jurisdiction and expertise, work by often rising above partisan interest to save the parliament’s time; they simplify work and conduct various studies. Article 193 of the Constitution of Nepal specifies that “the State Assembly may, as per its rules, form committees or special committees, as required, to manage its working procedures”. Thus, the number of thematic areas varies in each province. However, the functioning of these committees is undermined in several provinces. In Karnali, three of the four parliamentary committees—the Finance and Natural Resources Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Social Development Committee—are currently without heads. While the first committee has had no chief since April this year, the latter two have been vacant for three months. The prolonged leadership vacuum in important committees is also something that is routinely seen in other provinces. The five committees in Bagmati were at a standstill without chairpersons for more than a year since the first session of the start of the second term of the Bagmati Provincial Assembly in January 2023. The parliamentary committees in Lumbini and Sudurpaschim have been without their chairs after the formation of their respective assemblies last year. The absence of chiefs of these key provincial assembly parliamentary committees makes it difficult to hold the provincial governments accountable. These governments fail on governance, budget implementation and role assignment to the provincial assemblies. Passage of essential bills is also hampered. Four critical bills are stuck in various committees in Karnali. Meetings to facilitate dialogue between assembly members and ministers are yet to be convened. Moreover, the provincial government, taking advantage of the committee’s ineffectiveness and lack of monitoring, has been working arbitrarily, bypassing essential checks and balances.This in turn has added to the woes of Karnali, a geographically remote and severely underdeveloped region in western Nepal. The inactivity of the Social Development Committee is particularly concerning in a province where basic social indicators, such as health and literacy, lag far behind the national average. As the committee also deals with ministries of land management, agriculture and cooperatives, labour and social justice and human rights commission, works related to these areas are also affected. Despite the province’s rich natural resources, their potential remains untapped. Lack of development activities, particularly road-related infrastructure, has affected the province’s tourism prospects. The inactivity of the Finance and Natural Resources Committee is, therefore, troubling. More worryingly, another leaderless committee—Public Accounts—which oversees the financial discipline of the province, could fail to monitor corruption activities.Provincial governments were envisioned as significant drivers of localised development and accountability, but they have often become battlegrounds for political manoeuvring. Because of this, appointments for the leadership positions in these committees, as has happened in Bagmati in the past, have been deliberately delayed by the political parties. Even though Karnali’s assembly regulations allow the eldest member of the assembly committee to act as an interim chief, this provision has not been invoked. The political parties would do well to appoint the chairs immediately to stop the erosion of public trust in provincial governments—unless that is precisely their intent.    \nThe recent ‘framework agreement for BRI cooperation’ could be the perfect impetus for Nepal and China to kickstart the stalled BRI projects. Notably, the deal has the backing of both of Nepal’s major political forces, which together constitute nearly two-third parliamentary majority. China’s strained relations with the Nepali Congress, the country’s biggest political party, has been a hurdle to closer bilateral ties. While Beijing sees the Congress doing the bidding of Washington and New Delhi, the Congress feels China, going beyond the bounds of diplomacy, wants to cultivate exclusive ties with Nepal’s communist parties. The framework agreement could help change such unhelpful mutual suspicions. It was signed with the consent of the Congress. Beijing will take note. Some may argue that there is still disgruntlement in the Congress over the agreement. But then, was the entire party on board even when the Congress leadership took the monumental decision to form a government under KP Sharma Oli’s leadership?The other day, I bumped into a senior leader from the ‘rival’ Congress camp. As we both sipped masala tea while soaking in the winter sun, I started picking his brain. “The Congress is divided over the new BRI agreement, isn't it?” I asked. “These are useless murmurs of discontent inside the party,” he replied without missing a beat. “As the party functions today, if daju-bhauju want something, they get it.”Just like the CPN-UML is a one-man Oli show these days, the Congress too is firmly under the control of the Deubas—Sher Bahadur and Arzu Rana. It was the couple who dragged the party willy-nilly into the government, and they also had the final say from the Congress on the BRI deal. “If it’s fait accompli, why are some Kanresis still making hue and cry about the deal?” I pressed the Congress leader.“I will tell you in one word: India.” The southern neighbour is not happy with Nepal’s participation in the BRI. The initiative, with the China Pakistan Economic Corridor as its centerpiece, is seen as inimical to Indian interests. Kathmandu’s participation in it also threatens to yank Nepal out of India’s orbit.A Nepal-based Indian diplomat chose to put it thus: “Look how the MCC deal progressed in Nepal. The relevant document was in public domain and the compact was vigorously debated in your parliament. Shouldn’t the same metric apply to the Belt and Road Initiative? You guys haven’t even seen any of the vital BRI documents!”As the Congress leader suggested, if there are no new irritants in Congress-UML relations, the disagreement within the Congress over the new BRI deal could soon blow over. It should. The Deubas may have backed the framework for their personal goals. More importantly, it is also in Nepal’s interest. If India’s repeated blockades have taught us something, it is not to rely too heavily on our southern neighbour. This, among other things, means reaching out to Beijing to build vital connectivity projects and develop new economic links. But Nepal cannot lean too far towards China as well: We are two different societies with vastly different political cultures. This is why we must strike a careful balance between the two neighbours—and with the new sky neighbour in the United States. But this again will be impossible if the Congress and the UML continue to wield Nepal’s foreign policy as a domestic political bludgeon. Traditionally, the Nepali communists have cottoned to China. On the other hand, the Nepali Congress has been a staunch backer of close ties with India. These party-wise leanings have done great harm to Nepal. For this reason, the need for a consensus based foreign policy has long been felt. The country’s two biggest parties often (and naturally) found themselves in opposite benches in parliament and fought tooth and nail on foreign policy, particularly over India and China. The debates around the American MCC compact were rather acrimonious too. Now, by sheer luck, the Congress and the UML are together in the government. This presents a rare opportunity to build broad consensus on foreign policy. Oli has gone to China and stitched together an important deal. Perhaps he can do the same with India and with Nepal’s other important international friends—again with the support of the Congress. In this way, this ‘coalition of convenience’ for Oli and Deuba could herald an era of a more coordinated foreign policy approach. The new China deal has already given an encouraging message that Nepali political parties are capable of acting together on vital foreign policy issues.Some may reckon many aspects of the BRI are still vague and as such Nepal should be cautious. True. Yet the current agreement also gives Nepal enough wiggle room to back out of unwanted proposals from Beijing. The ‘aid financing modalities’ can include both soft loans and grants. Based on the deal, it would be impossible for Beijing to insist that Nepal accept high-interest Chinese loans. This possibility will be further mitigated if negotiations take place on a case-by-case basis. Principally, Nepal cannot refuse any and all kinds of loans from China—as some in the Congress argue it should—while it eagerly laps up such loans from the rest of the world. In any case, under three percent of the foreign loans Nepal has taken comes from China—less than what Japan or India have lent it. By contrast, the World Bank and the ADB contribute over 80 percent of Nepal’s loans. As the BRI is the centrepiece of China’s foreign engagement under President Xi Jinping, Nepal cannot reject the initiative and still maintain healthy relations with Beijing. If we can agree on the right projects, there is no harm in taking some soft loans under the BRI. Again, going beyond the BRI, the Congress and the UML should take the lead in preparing a common white paper on foreign policy—while they are still a part of the ruling coalition. History suggests this will be difficult to do when the parties are in opposition camps.  \nBritish philosopher Bertrand Russell in his famous essay about the idea of a university says that a university is, first and foremost, a place. He stresses that a university—though it is a concept, an idea, a poetics of space and a metaphor of culture and life—is, in the final analysis, a place. We should be clear about that. This famous essay in the English textbook, The English We Use, was discussed with Bachelor level students at Tribhuvan University. It represents Russell's concept of space as a sanctuary of a university. The period when we taught this essay was marked by a certain shift in educational innovations and what the university claimed “a quest for a new educational system”. It happened sometime in the early 1970s. The experiment was called the New Education System Plan introduced by Tribhuvan University. The plan, among other things, tried to shuffle or deconstruct the concept of “university” as a place and introduce an idea that used new technologies in education to diffuse certain fixed notions about it and invent ways to make educational experiments. I want to cite from a keynote address that I delivered at the 34th Annual Conference of the Linguistic Society of Nepal on November 26, 2013. “When the New Education System Plan used computer for screening applications for admission in colleges the news spread like Australian bush fire. I remember one senior citizen who turned up at a working centre located in Padmakanya campus seeking admission of his daughter-in-law at the proficiency certificate level some time in 1972, asking … ‘Sir, I want to meet computer sir because they say he has taken the entire responsibility of admitting or rejecting students’ bharnaa’”. As a young teacher at the university, I was also assigned to work as a member of that team meeting on the campus. Professor Shiva Gopal Risal had tried to seek to sort out the senior man’s question respectfully. Did the computer come as a toy to confound people, create wonder and deprive them of educational opportunities, or promote true education? No responsible agency addressed that question.A straight answer is that Tribhuvan University, the sole higher educational institution in the country, was seeking to pluralise the concept of place as a university. It wanted to do so by challenging the concept of a fixed space and substituting in its place the idea of education as a concept that could be shared across the campuses. But that concept did bring problems with it. It came as a double whammy—educational spaces lost their unique identities and failed to use the new syllabuses and technologies that were few and far between. That varied according to the nature of the institutions. However, the idea of using new technologies to teach humanities and social sciences did not work. The following period saw the emergence of several universities and higher educational institutions. Spaces multiplied. Opportunities came to open plural centres and locations to impart higher education understood under different geographical and cultural rubrics. One can easily guess that the period had brought some euphoric moments. People who took up the cudgel to start new institutional centres under this euphoria were doing admirable work. But things do not appear to have worked to fulfil the good dreams of the good people. Tribhuvan University continued to grow larger and attract more students. I am dismayed by the smaller number of students at other higher educational institutions or universities in Nepal. Sudip Kaini of Kantipur presents some important figures in his survey of students’ enrollment. The students enrolling for university education appear to go mostly to TU (more than 77 percent). Of the 16 universities, hardly one percent get admitted to 10 universities. According to one University Grants Commission report, out of more than 0.6 million students, almost 0.5 million go to TU. In terms of percentage, the rate of admission in Pokhara University is 5.56, Kathmandu University is 3.33, Far Western University is 3.06, Mid Western University is 1.61, University of Forest and Agriculture is 0.64, Nepal Sanskrit University is 0.52 and Lumbini Baudha University is 0.29. All these universities were established over a decade ago. The figures speak volumes. The onus of higher education lies on the largest and the oldest TU.Reports about the land grabbing of Tribhuvan University's central location are emerging. Reportedly, out of the 3,613 ropanis of the University's land, 900 ropanis are occupied by 19 outer organisations. (Naya Patrika, June 29, 2022). That is a stunning report. The figures and reports are easily available now. Other universities in the country have their own narratives about their lands. The land story shows the centrality of the TU in terms of its size, location and spread. It has become more crucial to address the question of land because of the needs of universities other than TU. Universities tell their stories about acquiring spaces, with the theme of politics and power, which have become an essential subject of discussion today. For instance, Kathmandu University acquired spaces inside Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur metropolis and outside to open its various institutions and departments; it is unique in many ways.We return to the mega story of TU trying to track its land, which people and institutions grabbed over a long period. Evoking Russell's idea of a university as a place, we can say that TU, far from finding its spaces and cogently using them to create sanctuaries, is fighting on two fronts—restoring ownership of its land and using that for academic purposes by making the institution stronger and more important. To take an eloquent example, the euphoric activities of good sports and the noise and crowd generated by it indicate the centrality and importance of TU's space in Kirtipur. It is natural for a university that gives higher education to the 77 percent of the students of this land, irrespective of the fact that there are other functioning universities, to find its space, its land, and to seek to function with dignity and a system. The whole thing is related to the question of space, prestige and the creation of a permanent operation system. I believe now is the right time to work on all these fronts. I want to repeat a popular Nepali expression—sabailai chetana bhaya.  \nIt is no secret that Nepal is teetering on the scale of economic fragility. Even though the government has introduced some progressive policies and economic benchmarks, the country still struggles to stabilise its economy. This is partly due to an excessive reliance on remittances and policies favouring their growth. Remittances may appear beneficial but can lead to instability in various other sectors. Such a phenomenon is known as the Dutch disease effect. In the 1960s, the Dutch economy grew as they discovered large swathes of oil deposits in the Northern Sea. An oil boom of this calibre can speed up the economic growth of any nation. However, such shallow development led to inflation, eventually sickening their economy. Subsequently, non-petroleum commodities became less competitive and more expensive. In other words, overly depending on a single export source led to the erosion of the value of other commodities. Nepal isn’t known for having oil reserves and deposits like that of the Netherlands. However, several experts and policymakers have highlighted that the burgeoning inflow of remittances can cause a series of Dutch disease-like impacts akin to that of commodity booms. Since the disease affects any economy that is heavily reliant on foreign currency, foreign assistance and foreign direct investments, Nepal, in particular, becomes vulnerable. As the gap in the remittance-to-nation ratio continues to widen, the national currency value is likely to diminish. The latest report from Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) states that Nepal’s remittance for the fiscal year 2023-24 totalled Rs1,445.32 billion, a 15 percent increase compared to the previous fiscal year. In contrast, the data on remittance in 2016 was Rs679 billion, which is less than half the remittance as of this year. Such a level of dependency can exacerbate inflation, drive up consumption prices and intensify the real estate bubbles. When the value of properties becomes far more than its worth, it creates a mass trickle-down effect that continues to pour over other productive sectors. The symptoms of Dutch disease continue to strain the Nepali economy for two main reasons. First, there is a significant exodus of labour migrants. Many Nepalis flock to foreign countries, either temporarily or permanently. This is encouraged by the government as well as political leaders. Second, Nepali consumers often have a preference for imported commodities. As the country becomes less independent, it relies far more than necessary on imports. Several macroeconomic reports indicate a negative trade-off for Nepal in its exports of labour migrants and skilled manpower, with many opting to reside abroad in search of a better life. No amount of Riyals, Ringgits, or Dirhams can compensate for the loss of a long-term sustainable development. Production doesn’t become feasible for the general populace, leading to overreliance on imports. In a nation where the balance of payments is consistently stretching towards the negative bottom, the lack of adequate labour force participation has become a hindrance in productive sectors. NRB’s empirical analysis suggests that further reliance on remittance at an increasing level can widen the trade deficits, both in the short and the long run. As consumer demand increases, the supply side can barely keep up, creating inflationary pressures and increasing prices.Further, a nation that prides itself on its so-called vision of independence is now at the mercy of remittances. A shift in policies or geopolitical instability, rising tensions within the Gulf nations, and the spread of the Israel-Palestine conflict to other nations can dramatically affect the prospects of labour migrants sending their hard-earned money home. There is no denying that remittance has played a significant role in Nepal’s economy. It has contributed considerably to economic growth and increased foreign exchange reserves. However, the concerned authorities shouldn’t forget that excess reliance on one economic sector can lead to a perpetual decline in other sectors. Given the threat of excess dependency on remittance, Nepal must diversify its economic portfolio. Concomitantly, with the help of effective plans and policies, the exodus of foreign labour migrants must be mitigated. Opportunities should be created and provided in the home country. Financial institutions that draft impactful policies must adhere to congenial policies. The need for macroprudential policies, whose primary goal is to maintain financial stability and limit fiscal vulnerabilities, becomes more crucial to minimise the possibility of carrying the symptoms of the Dutch disease. Only by acting prudently can Nepal safeguard its economy. \nNepal has been placed in a challenging Group F for the AFC Asian Cup 2027 Qualifiers following the draw held at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. Nepal will compete against Vietnam, Malaysia, and Laos, in what is expected to be a demanding group stage.Each team in the group will play home-and-away matches, starting on March 25, when Nepal faces Malaysia. Nepal will then play Malaysia again on November 18, Laos on June 10 and March 31 next year, and Vietnam on October 9 and 14.The qualifiers feature 24 teams divided into six groups, with the group winners securing a place in the AFC Asian Cup 2027 to be held in Saudi Arabia.Group A comprises Tajikistan, the Philippines, the Maldives, and Timor-Leste, while Group B includes Lebanon, Yemen, Bhutan, and Brunei. Group C features India, Hong Kong, and Bangladesh. Group D has Thailand, Turkmenistan, Chinese Taipei, and Sri Lanka, and Group E comprises Syria, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Pakistan. \nPolice arrested eight people on charge of gang-raping a 14-year-old girl in Bardiya. Three other accused are on the run.According to Rupesh Shah, Inspector at the Area Police Office in Motipur, the suspects were detained after the victim lodged a complaint against them. The Bardiya district court on Monday remanded the suspects in custody for five days for investigation. The victim claimed that the suspects repeatedly raped her three months ago. Investigation is underway into the case, said police.  \nIndia has appointed current revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra as the new Reserve Bank of India governor, a notification from the government’s cabinet appointments committee on Monday showed.Malhotra, who has previously also held the post of secretary in India’s financial services department, will take over from Shaktikanta Das whose six-year term concludes on Tuesday.The Indian Administrative Service Officer, who over the last three decades has worked across sectors including power, finance, taxation, information technology and mines, has been appointed for a three-year term.Das took over as central bank chief in 2018, after previous governor Urjit Patel resigned before the end of his term following a difficult relationship with the government.Das had helped stabilise relations with the government while also overseeing a period of recovery in India’s financial sector and most recently led an effort to prevent a build-up of risk, asking lenders to avoid all “forms of exuberance.”The central bank, under Das, has also been seen as more interventionist in financial markets, stamping out volatility in the exchange rate to decadal lows. \nIsrael will step up airstrikes on Syrian stores of advanced weaponry, Israeli officials said on Monday, and keep a ‘limited’ troop presence on the ground, hoping to head off any threat that could emerge in the fallout of president Bashar al-Assad’s overthrow.Israel has watched the upheaval in Syria with a mixture of hope and concern as it weighs the consequences of one of the most significant strategic shifts in the Middle East in years.While Assad's fall wiped out a bastion from which Israel’s arch-foe Iran had exercised influence in the region, the lightning advance of a disparate group of rebel forces with roots in the Islamist ideology of Al Qaeda poses risks.Defence Minister Israel Katz said the military would “destroy heavy strategic weapons throughout Syria, including surface-to-air missiles, air defence systems, surface-to-surface missiles, cruise missiles, long-range rockets, and coastal missiles.”A senior Israeli official said airstrikes would persist in the coming days, while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel had no interest in interfering in internal Syrian affairs and was concerned only with defending its citizens.“That’s why we attack strategic weapons systems like, for example, remaining chemical weapons or long-range missiles and rockets in order that they will not fall into the hands of extremists,” Saar told reporters in Jerusalem.Still reeling from the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ attack in October 2023, Israel is also looking to head off any future threat from its neighbour.Israeli forces had already cleared landmines and established new barriers on the frontier between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and a demilitarised strip bordering Syria in October.Early on Sunday, the military said it had sent ground forces into the demilitarised zone, a 400-sq-km (155-sq-mile) buffer created by a 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement and overseen by the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF).The military on Monday published photos of Israeli commandos in the Syrian Mount Hermon area.Saar said the troop presence was strictly limited. “It’s basically near our borders, sometimes a few hundred metres, sometimes one mile or two miles,” he said. “It is a very limited and temporary step we took for security reasons.” \nTaiwan raised its alert level on Monday saying China has set up seven zones of reserved airspace and deployed naval fleets and coast guard boats in what a security source described as the first military drills across a broad swathe of the region's waters.A senior Taiwan security official told Reuters that China currently has nearly 90 navy and coast guard ships in waters near Taiwan, the southern Japanese islands and the East and South China Seas, of which around two-thirds were navy vessels.Beijing’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, had been expected to launch another round of exercises in response to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te’s trip to the Pacific, which included stopovers in Hawaii and the US territory of Guam, security sources had told Reuters.China has set up seven “temporary reserved areas” of airspace to the east of its eastern Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, Taiwan’s defence ministry said in a statement, adding those zones are valid from Monday to Wednesday.Such zones are temporarily reserved and allocated for a particular user during a set period, though other flights can pass through with permission from controllers, according to international rules.In Washington, the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Taiwan security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the scale of China’s navy and coast guard deployment was larger than the previous two major drills around Taiwan this year, which were dubbed “Joint Sword 2024-A” and “Joint Sword 2024-B”.“For the first time they are targeting the entire island chain,” the source said, referring to an area that runs from Japan through Taiwan, the Philippines and onto Borneo, enclosing China’s coastal seas.\"They are meant to achieve total military intimidation by positioning to control the inner part of the island chain.\"Taiwan’s military said it has activated its “combat readiness exercises” at strategic locations and its naval and coast guard boats are closely monitoring Chinese military activities.“Any unilateral and irrational, provocative actions could seriously damage peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and that will not be welcomed by the international community,” Taiwan’s defence ministry said.‘Grey Zone Harassment’The reason behind China's reserved airspace zones was still unclear, said Wang Ting-yu, a senior lawmaker for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party.\"They are likely to run military activities, or it's only just a false alarm meant to exert political pressures,\" said Wang, who leads the parliament's defence and foreign affairs committee.“Please be a civilized neighbouring country. Don't be a troublemaker all the time.”Taiwan's coast guard, in a separate statement, said that seven Chinese coast guard ships have been carrying out “grey-zone harassment” against the island since earlier in the day.China does not have the right to carry out any intrusion or law enforcement actions in Taiwan’s waters, and Taipei has the right to take necessary measures in response, the coast guard said.Taipei says China has been using “grey-zone” tactics that stop short of actual combat to test and pressure Taiwanese forces, including daily air force and navy missions around the island and regular coast guard patrols.Beijing detests Lai as a “separatist” and has rebuffed his repeated calls for talks. Lai and his government reject Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying only Taiwan’s people can decide their future.China’s sabre rattling around Taiwan, as well as in the disputed South China Sea, has raised fears of possible conflict.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking to US sailors at the Yokosuka naval base in Japan on Monday, said China is the only country in the world that has the intent and increasingly the capability to change the rules-based international order.“And so we want to see this region, this area remain open to freedom of navigation and the ability to fly the skies and international airways whenever we want to,” he added. \nAt least 40 schools received a bomb threat by email in Delhi on Monday demanding $30,000, ANI news agency said, while police officials conducted initial searches on school premises.Schools, railway stations and airports this year have been subject to hundreds of bomb threats, which have later turned out to be hoaxes.Airlines and airports in India received 999 hoax bomb threats from the start of the year until mid-November, and 12 people had been arrested during the same period, government data shows.Two schools got the threatening email on Sunday night, which said multiple bombs were planted inside buildings and would be detonated if the sender was not paid $30,000, according to ANI.Many other schools received the emails on Monday morning, prompting school authorities to call parents to take the students home for the day.Parents were seen picking their children up from the gates of some schools as police checked school premises for suspicious items.Police officials in Delhi did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.In May, more than 50 schools in Delhi and the adjoining suburb of Noida received similar bomb threat emails that turned out to be hoaxes. \nThe Embassy of India in Nepal, in collaboration with the Lumbini Development Trust and Lumbini Buddhist University, organised the second edition of the India-Nepal Cultural Festival in Lumbini on Sunday.The festival celebrated the rich cultural heritage and traditions of both India and Nepal, with a special focus on Buddhism, read a press note issued by the Indian Embassy.The event was jointly inaugurated by Governor of Lumbini Province Krishna Bahadur Gharti Magar; Prachanda Bikram Neupane, minister for Industry, Tourism & Transport Management of Lumbini Province; Janmajay Timilsina, minister for Social Development of Lumbini Province; Lharkyal Lama, vice chairman of Lumbini Development Trust; and Prasanna Shrivastava, deputy chief of mission at the Embassy of India in Kathmandu. In the evening a cultural programme was held, highlighting a Kathak dance recital, themed around Buddhism, performed by an eight-member troupe from India led by Shikha Sharma and traditional Nepali dance performances by Swojan Raghubanshi and his group, said the embassy.Additionally, an academic seminar titled “Buddhist Cultural Heritage of India and Nepal” was organised at Lumbini Buddhist University. The seminar brought together eminent Buddhist scholars from India and Nepal, who shared their valuable insights on the cultural and historical significance of Buddhist heritage in both countries.This interaction aimed at promoting and strengthening the age-old cultural heritage, and close ties between India and Nepal with a deeper appreciation for Indian art forms among the young students of the school, the release stated. \nJust weeks after her groundbreaking Nobel Prize win, Han Kang’s books have sold millions of copies nationwide.Last week, annual sales reports from major Korean bookstores revealed that half of the year’s top-10 bestsellers were Han's works.Particularly noteworthy is that among her titles, “Human Acts” holds the No. 1 spot on both Kyobo Book Center, the country’s largest bookstore chain, and Yes24, the leading online retailer. With the global acclaim of “The Vegetarian,” which won the International Booker Prize in 2016, and the recent praise for her latest release, “We Do Not Part,” it is “Human Acts” that has resonated most profoundly with Korean readers.Coincidentally, the current political situation in Korea, sparked by President Yoon Seok Yeol’s proclamation of martial law on Tuesday evening, has drawn comparisons to the historical context depicted in “Human Acts.”The novel draws from the May 18 Gwangju Democratic Uprising of 1980, a brutal massacre by the South Korean military that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of students and unarmed civilians.The country’s previous martial law was declared on October 27, 1979, by then-Interim President Choi Kyu-hah, following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee. The 440 days of martial law saw numerous pro-democracy movements and the December 12, 1979, military coup that brought former President Chun Doo-hwan to power. Chun extended martial law nationwide at midnight, on May 18, and the Gwangju Democratic Uprising erupted as citizens protested Chun’s martial regime.Readers have filled online reviews with reflections linking the book to contemporary events.“I never wanted the events of this book to repeat, but now, after Tuesday, martial law has taken on a chilling relevance. Thankfully, it was lifted quickly, but democracy demands constant vigilance,” one comment reads.Another comment says, “Today (Tuesday) must not be forgotten. We saw how history can repeat itself if we let these stories fade. Please, don’t forget.”Han, who was born in Gwangju and lived there until just months before the uprising, acknowledged the parallels during a press conference in Stockholm on Friday.“Like everyone else that night, I was deeply shocked,” she said. “To write ‘Human Acts,’ I spent a lot of time studying the martial law events that happened back in 1979. For me to witness a similar situation unfold in real time in 2024 was startling. One difference between the situation in 1979 and the winter of 2024 is that this time it was broadcast live for everyone to witness.”Han also spoke about how the city holds special meaning for her as her hometown and its significance as the backdrop for the novel.“It is my wish that violence or coercion will not take place to suppress the press. We should not go back to the past where the press was oppressed by the government,” she continued.She underscored the critical role of literature in confronting violence and fostering resilience.“Language cannot be coerced. It cannot be stopped so no matter what happens in the future, the truth will continue to be told. The power of language cannot be stopped.”-In Association with ANN \nToday the weather is forecast to be generally to mostly cloudy in Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and partly to generally cloudy in the rest of the country.Light to moderate rain is likely to occur at some places of Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and light rain at a few areas of hilly regions of the rest of the country. The Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecasted chances of light to moderate snowfall at many places of the high hilly and mountainous regions of Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and at a few places of high hilly and mountainous regions of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki Province.Tonight the weather will be partly to generally cloudy in Karnali Province along with the hilly regions of the country and Partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country. Light rain is likely to occur in a few places of Karnali Province and at one or two places in hilly regions of the rest of the country. There is a chance of light snowfall at some places of the high hilly and mountainous regions of Gandaki, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and at one or two places of high hilly and mountainous regions of Koshi and Bagmati Province.On Sunday Janakpur experienced the maximum temperature of 26°C, while Jumla registered the minimum temperature at -7.4°C.  \nNabil Bank Limited has introduced an ‘appointment banking system’ aimed at busy professionals, business owners, and customers who value their time and seek efficient service.This service is now available at the bank’s Head Office, Teendhara, Kathmandu.According to the bank, the appointment banking system enables customers to schedule a visit for essential banking services such as cash and cheque transactions, ensuring a faster and hassle-free experience. “This initiative is part of Nabil Bank’s continuous efforts to embrace digital banking and leverage the power of digitisation for prompt service and enhancing customer experience,” said Krishna Prasad Subedi, chief marketing officer of the bank.The system's key features include ensuring faster and hassle-free service for time-sensitive customers and making convenient bookings under which appointments can be scheduled quickly through the Nabil Bank website or the NBank App.The dedicated service minimises waiting time with professional assistance for cash and cheque transactions.“At Nabil Bank, we are committed to delivering innovative solutions that prioritise our customers’ needs. This reflects our dedication to providing efficient, personalised, and time-saving services, especially for professionals and businesses managing packed schedules,” said Subedi. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nThree years after Sher Bahadur Deuba got re-elected to the party president of Nepali Congress, the issue of who is the party’s second in hierarchy after Deuba is yet to be resolved.It re-emerged as a serious issue in the party’s provincial conference on Saturday.The Nepali Congress organised the party’s Koshi provincial conference in Biratnagar, the first of its kind convened after the party adapted to the provincial structure. Some key leaders opted out though. Among those were Shekhar Koirala, who leads the party’s anti-establishment faction, and party general secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma.The boycott of Koirala and other leaders has triggered an intra-party debate. At the provincial level, the conference is considered the second most important event in the party’s organisational affairs after provincial convention, which elects provincial leadership.Party president Deuba, Senior Vice President Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, former general secretary duo Shashank Koirala and Krishna Prasad Sitaula including other second-rung leaders of the party took part in the conference. Koshi’s former chief minister Kedar Karki, who is close to Shekhar Koirala, gave two reasons why Koirala didn’t participate. The party had not consulted Koirala on the provincial conference and he got the invitation late, said Karki, “which is why Koirala instead took part in a pre-set function in Chitwan”. Contrary to Karki’s claim, other leaders close to Koirala said that the top leader skipped the conference for other reasons. “As Koirala’s supporters, we had asked the top party leadership to ensure Koirala’s hierarchy would be just below party president at the conference. But our demand was ignored,” a leader close to Shekhar Koirala told the Post. “This is why he skipped the meet.”Shekhar Koirala and his faction have been demanding that he be given the second position after the president in the party hierarchy. In Congress, the leader who is runner-up in the race for the party’s presidential election is usually given second position. Koirala is yet to be given that position. He was the closest contender for the post of president at the 14th general convention, when Deuba retained the party’s top post.Senior journalist Purushottam Dahal, who is close to Congress, said it is not mandatory for a leader in the Congress to be given the title of senior leader with second position in the hierarchy.“But that would also not be something abnormal,” Dahal added.Earlier, Ramchandra Paudel, who lost to Deuba in the race for party presidency in 2016, was given the second position and designated as senior leader. Shekhar Koirala is now asking for the same.At present, Purna Bahadur Khadka who is the party’s senior vice-president, is in the second position after party chief Deuba. Khadka was elected as vice-president at the party’s last general convention.Koirala, who opted out of the Saturday’s provincial gathering, however, had organised a separate meeting of his faction, which was attended by municipal-level chairmen in Biratnagar on December 3 by defying the party central committee’s circular.Leaders Shekhar Koirala, Sunil Sharma, Dig Bahadur Limbu, Minendra Rijal, and Gururaj Ghimire, among others, attended the closed session.Ghimire, a Congress leader from Koirala-led camp, said that Koirala did not participate in Saturday's conference “due to the incompetence of the party president and the provincial president”. Ghimire said that although Koirala was placed second in party hierarchy in the two provincial conferences organised earlier, he was not given that hierarchy in the Koshi provincial gathering—even though the event was being organised in his own constituency.Before Koshi province, the Congress held such provincial conferences in Lumbini and Gandaki. In both gatherings, Koirala was invited in the capacity as party leader after the president, said Ghimire. Koirala also had attended both the conferences. While Koirala reached Chitwan citing his engagement in an pre-arranged event, General Secretary Sharma went to Solukhumbu for a Khumbu trek. According to the secretariat of Sharma, Khubmu trek had been scheduled earlier. But it had to be postponed after Sharma was appointed the party’s commander for the December 1 bypolls. “It is the failure of the party president and provincial president to not be able to accommodate two influential party leaders in the provincial conference,” Ghimire said. In Koshi, Uddhav Thapa, who is close to Krishna Prasad Sitaula, is the provincial chief. Sitaula himself is now considered close to party president Deuba.“It would be easier for us if the party statute itself clearly defined the role and hierarchy of senior party leaders,” Thapa said. General Secretary Gagan Thapa said that everyone needs space and respect while addressing the conference.General Secretary Thapa, who participated in the conference organised in Koirala’s hometown Biratnagar, emphasised that leaders should put aside ‘technical issues’ and prioritise party unity. “Unity in the party is essential, and necessary to bring everyone together,” said General Secretary Thapa. “It is not enough to talk about technical unity, it is a political matter that needs to be resolved politically… everyone should be accommodated.” But Thapa, who was earlier with Koirala and jointly led the ‘Koirala-Thapa camp’, lambasted the factional gathering organised by Koirala in Biratnagar. Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa formed a panel and contested for the posts of party president and general secretary, respectively, in the last general convention. While Deuba defeated Koirala, Thapa got elected as a general secretary.Now, Deuba is out of the race as the party statute puts a two-term limit on party chief, while both Koirala and Thapa are aspirants for the top position. Of late, Thapa has been inching closer to Deuba while Koirala has been hardening his position against Deuba and his Saturday’s posture could be part of the same strategy, observers said.The 14th general convention of the Nepali Congress was held in December 2021. The party charter gives each elected body a tenure of four years. But if the general convention cannot be held within four years, the charter provides for a year’s extension.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has yet again postponed the general convention of its student wing All Nepal National Independent Students’ Union (Revolutionary).An office-bearers’ meeting of the party on Thursday decided to defer the 23rd general convention, which was slated to commence in the Capital on Sunday. After several postponements, the national jamboree of the union started in September. However, it was suspended without electing the leadership following a dispute over the selection of convention representatives and whether or not set up an age bar for the leadership.With no sign for the resumption of the convention, a team of party’s student leaders, led by vice-chair Keshab Rawal, staged a hunger strike demanding the national gathering be held in December second week and leadership elected through a vote. They withdrew their strike with the party leadership agreeing to hold the convention starting on December 8. However, the party meeting led by chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal decided to defer the convention citing lack of preparations due to the need for the party to focus on local by-polls.The next Standing Committee meeting called for December 12 will take a decision regarding its student wing’s convention, according to party leaders.The student leaders, however, seem unconvinced. Rawal, who also is a contender for the union’s presidency, accused the party leadership of treating students as their slaves, who must obey them without question.“This is not just interference in student affairs, it shows they see us as slaves,” Rawal told the Post. “This is unacceptable. I don’t believe the party’s next meeting will announce the date. I will stage a protest again.” Though the party has cited lack of preparation for the postponement, insiders suggest that Dahal is worried because his chosen candidate may not win the elections. “The second rung leaders do not agree with Dahal’s selection. Dahal is avoiding election because he fears his candidate might lose,” said a party leader. Around a dozen student leaders backed by different factions within the party are in the race for the union’s presidency. Party’s senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha supports Pawan Karki. Karki had been running a parallel organisation within the union after Dahal picked Pancha Singh as chair two years back. Barshaman Pun is pushing for Dipesh Pun or Tukman Mahara and Janardan Sharma wants Madan Bhul or Narayan Khanal. Both the leaders are deputy general secretaries in the Maoist Centre.Naresh Regmi has the backing of Pampha Bhusal and Dev Gurung, the party’s vice-chair and general secretary, respectively. Although Dahal hasn’t openly endorsed any candidate, he reportedly has a soft corner for Regmi. By supporting Regmi ahead, Dahal wants to please Bhusal and Gurung to garner their support to induct Netra Bikram Chand, who had earlier splintered from the Maoist Centre, in the party. But deputy general secretaries Pun and Sharma reportedly do not want Chand in the party.The deputy general secretaries, though they are rivals, have started coming together when it comes to challenging Dahal’s leadership. “They feel that Dahal is imposing his decision by dividing them. It is clear that Pun and Sharma will not accept Dahal’s candidate for the union’s chairperson. They might even field a common candidate to counter Dahal’s candidate if voting takes place,” said the leader. “Defeat of Dahal’s candidate would mean he is losing grip on the party organisation.”Some of the student leaders, however, believe the December 12 meeting would take a decision regarding the convention. “I believe the party will either decide to hold voting or will handpick the leadership,” said Regmi.For years, the Maoist Centre’s leadership has directly selected the leadership of its student union. As many as 2,323 representatives were handpicked for the national gathering in September.However, a section of the leaders raised questions over the legality of around 70 representatives, most of whom are enrolled to various institutions under the Council for Vocational Education and Training. The dissident group argues that these representatives were handpicked without following the proper selection process.The differences escalated to the extent where representatives smashed the furniture at the Kirtipur venue of the convention twice as they clashed. A group of student leaders, taking cue from Mahara, the son of Jokh Bahadur Mahara, former Lumbini chief minister, even brandished a khukuri (Gurkha knife). A large number of police personnel were deployed at the Tribhuvan University campus to contain the protest.Right from the commencement of the conference, there were strong calls to impose an age limit for student leaders. But not everyone agreed to that. Without consensus, the issue was to be decided through voting. However, the voting didn’t take place due to the lack of agreement over the representatives leading to the convention’s postponement. \nThe dispute between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Janamat Party has escalated as they engage in public accusations against each other through statements.For months, the party has been trying to remove its lawmaker Goma Labh Sapkota from the position claiming she was involved in an irregularity. The Madhesh-based party has been writing to the parliament secretariat and Speaker Devraj Ghimire urging them to remove Sapkota as a member of the lower house.In November first week, the party wrote to Ghimire for the third time claiming she needs to be sacked as a lawmaker alleging that she had received bribes from a contractor and was also conspiring to split the party. Ghimire on November 21 turned down the request arguing the charges the party has leveled against Sapkota don’t lead to her disqualification for the lawmaker post.He said the Political Parties Act has prescribed the conditions when a lawmaker loses his/her position, but the allegations against her don't fall under the conditions.Angered with the decision, the CK Raut-led party not only accused Ghimire of engaging in “criminal conduct” but also claimed that his decision was racist and reeked of bigotry. Issuing a press statement on Monday, it said the decision to continue Sapkota’s position was discriminatory and against the parliamentary norms.“By invalidating the party's disciplinary action, the Parliament Secretariat not only violated the party’s supremacy but also, by acting as a partisan of a particular party, went beyond its jurisdiction, engaging in unlawful, unconstitutional, and criminal acts that jeopardise the multi-party parliamentary system and democracy itself,” the Janamat Party’s statement reads. “If the Speaker is allowed to act beyond his jurisdiction with such arbitrary power, it will set a dangerous precedent and pose a significant threat to democracy.”The party also accused Ghimire of not taking action against Sapkota because she is his relative and had committed to joining the CPN-UML (after splitting the party). Ghimire was elected as the Speaker from the UML.Just because someone is a relative of the Speaker or has pledged to join the Speaker’s former party, he cannot defend a lawmaker even though the party’s central committee has taken action against her following all due legal process, the statement further reads.Further alleging Ghimire, the party claimed that the Speaker has been demonstrating extreme racist and discriminatory behavior in the past, especially regarding issues like the use of language and attire in Parliament, in allocating time and in other parliamentary proceedings.A day later, on Tuesday, the parliament secretariat issued a statement taking a serious exception to the party’s allegation against the Speaker. Through the statement, Anant Prasad Koirala, assistant spokesperson at the secretariat, rubbished the allegations claiming that there has been no discrimination on the grounds of caste, ethnicity, colour, gender, community, language, religion, or physical condition.He said the party requested for Sapkota dismissal as a lawmaker citing in accordance with the Section 35(2) of the Political Parties Act but the allegations aren’t in line with the prescribed conditions for the lawmaker’s dismissal.“The federal parliament secretariat, upon receiving the letter, presented the matter in accordance with the provisions of Nepal’s Constitution and relevant laws (the House of Representatives Rules, 2079 and the Political Parties Act, 2073), and the Speaker has made a decision in accordance with the law,” the Secretariat’s statement said. “The secretariat wants to inform that all the details of the Speaker’s decision are clear and, as always, will ensure that all actions are carried out in accordance with the law.”Sapkota has been refuting the allegations of corruption and conspiring against the party. She has claimed that she is being targetted because she didn’t appoint her personal assistant as dictated by her party leadership. \nOn December 1, when by-elections were underway for 41 vacant local level positions across 32 districts in seven provinces, Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) President Rajendra Lingden claimed that his party could win big in the next general elections, citing growing public disenchantment with the big political parties.Speaking at the inauguration of the party’s municipal convention in Birtamod, Jhapa President Lingden said, “There is no alternative to the RPP in Nepal, and the party should move forward accordingly.” However, when the complete results of the by-elections came on December 2, the RPP failed to win any of the contested posts. It could secure only 26 votes in the election for chair in ward 6 of Kankai Municipality in Jhapa, also Lingden’s hometown. Similarly, in the election for chair in ward 5 of Molung Rural Municipality in Okhaldhunga, the hometown of the party’s general secretary, Rajendra Gurung, the RPP garnered just three votes. However, the party spokesperson Mohan Shrestha later claimed that Lingden’s December 1 remarks referred to the 2027 general elections, not Sunday’s by-elections.But not all RPP leaders agree with Shrestha. Although some of them admit that the RPP’s agenda is drawing public interest, they blame the by-election losses on the party’s poor strategy and call for introspection. “When smaller parties, like the CPN (Unified Socialist) and Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party managed to win local unit positions, the RPP, the fifth largest party in the House of Representatives, failed to attract public support,” an RPP leader said talking to the Post.The party’s poor show has prompted some leaders to question Lingden’s leadership.“The candidates for the by-polls were selected without a formal discussion in the party,” said one of the party leaders requesting anonymity. “It is the failure of the party chief, and he should take responsibility for the setbacks.” The leader also said the party had performed poorly in the last year’s by-elections for federal and provincial positions.Party spokesperson Shrestha, however, dismisses these claims and allegations, arguing that the party did not lose any local level seats it previously held. “There is no question of the party chief taking responsibility for the outcome,” he said, talking to the Post. Some party leaders, however, allege that Lingden’s arbitrary decisions have caused setbacks for the party on many occasions. They say that Lingden did bring changes during the 2021 general convention, but he has failed to maintain the decorum of a party chief.Lately, internal strife has also intensified within the party. In October, while party general secretary Dhawal Shamsher Rana was undergoing treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, India, Lingden removed him as head of the organisation department and replaced him with senior leader Buddhiman Tamang. Also, Lingden has changed the responsibilities of other senior leaders during the same period. “The party chief’s decision to replace the organisation department chief is tied to the party’s poor show in the by-polls,” a dissident in the party told the Post. The party’s another spokesperson, Sagun Lawoti, thinks the RPP should analyse the by-election results thoroughly. “It is high time the party introspected its strategy,” Lawoti said. Political analysts, meanwhile, say that the RPP's failure in byelections reflects the public’s lack of support for its agenda of reinstating Hindu kingdom. “RPP is clinging to a redundant agenda which has no traction with the people,” Mumaram Khanal, a left-leaning political analyst, said.Below is the RPP’s vote tallies in Sunday’s by-elections, according to the Election Commission website: \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nThe Rs7.34 billion Siddhababa tunnel project is all set for a breakthrough.According to project officials, the 1.12-kilometre tunnel project on the landslide- and rockslide-prone Butwal-Palpa section of the Siddhartha Highway is set to achieve its final breakthrough in the first week of January. Two of the three bypass cross passages have been completed along this busy highway, which connects the hill districts of Lumbini and Gandaki provinces to Butwal and several Tarai districts.According to the project, the first bypass, spanning 151 metres, and the third bypass, measuring 130 metres, have been completed, and 165 metres of the major tunnel work remains to be completed.The project office said that 961 meters of digging on the north and south ends of the main tunnel were completed by Wednesday. Work on the main tunnel is being carried out simultaneously from both ends.“Workers are busy in the main tunnel,” said Krishna Raj Adhikari, the project's chief. The first bypass links the upper Siddhababa temple, and the third bypass connects to the Dobhan dam side. The section, notorious for its dangers, has claimed many lives, prompting the government to construct the tunnel. Over the last decade, at least 421 travellers have lost their lives, and many others have sustained injuries in numerous accidents on the treacherous 4-km road section, according to the District Traffic Office, Palpa.More than 10,000 vehicles ply the road section every day.The China State Construction Engineering Corporation signed the contract in March 2022 with a completion deadline of five years.The project is being constructed under the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) model, where a single contractor is responsible for all components, such as design, engineering, construction, and procurement.The contract binds the contractor to deliver the project within the stipulated timeframe and at the predetermined price, regardless of any possible cost overruns.According to the project office, the tunnel's physical progress has reached 33.59 percent, and its financial progress is at 32.2 percent. “As we are actively working for the main tunnel breakthrough within a month, we have ramped up manpower and resources,” said Adhikari.He said the project has sufficient blasting material in stock, and the construction company has deployed around 150 workers at the construction site to keep the project on track.The tunnel design has progressed as planned. “We have also strictly followed safety measures while widening the road,” said Adhikari. “The work inside the tunnel is progressing rapidly, but work on the outside has yet to start as efforts are underway to control landslides outside the tunnel.”“Rock shed and road designing works are also moving ahead smoothly,” said Adhikari. A rock shed is a protective structure built over a road or tunnel to shield it from falling rocks and debris. This protective covering redirects the falling material safely away, reducing the risk of accidents in landslide-prone areas.To stabilise the hillside around the tunnel in the Siddhababa area, a rock shed has been constructed over 1495 square metres, and work is underway to protect an additional 495 square metres on the northern side. The China State Construction Engineering Corporation was awarded the tender worth Rs7.34 billion. Besides a rock shed, the contractor will also construct rock fall netting and slope protection structures on the outer side of the tunnel.As per the detailed project report prepared with assistance from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the 1.12-kilometre tunnel will have double lanes with a width of 8.5 metres along with sidewalks. Around 900 meters of the double-lane road will link to the Chidiya River on the Butwal side and 560 meters will connect to the Palpa side.The Siddhababa-Dovan road section is the main link between more than a dozen districts in the plains and hills such as Palpa, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, Syangja, Kaski, Parbat, and Baglung.The tunnel is expected to provide safer and easier travel along the highway between the distrticts of Lumbini and Gandaki provinces. \nBarahi Kathmandu hosted an exclusive Christmas cake-mixing event on Thursday in its elegant private lounge, offering stunning panoramic city views.The event saw the presence of several high-profile guests, including celebrities, socialites, high corporate profiles and travel influencers who came together to celebrate the joy of the season, the hotel said in a press statement. Guests participated in the lively activity of blending a rich assortment of dried fruits, nuts, and aromatic spices to create the base for Barahi’s signature Christmas cakes. The private lounge’s luxurious ambience and breathtaking views of Kathmandu’s skyline set the perfect stage for this festive celebration. Roshan Sapkota, general manager of Barahi Kathmandu, expressed his delight at the successful event: “We are honoured to have hosted such an esteemed gathering for our Christmas Cake Mixing Event. This tradition is about more than just creating delicious treats; it’s about fostering connections and spreading festive cheer.With our distinguished guests’ support and our city’s unmatched views, this year’s celebration has been truly extraordinary.” \nOn Thursday, the Special Court convicted 11 individuals, including four top Nepali officials, in a corruption case involving the purchase of two Airbus A330s in 2017 for the national flag carrier, Nepal Airlines.However, Special Court officials say the case is still wide open. More people could be involved in the dubious deal, as cases and investigations in other countries are ongoing.This follows an investigation transcript document on Nepali-born British citizen Deepak Sharma, the former executive of AAR, a US-based aviation services provider, who was the plane supplier. Sharma admitted to the US Department of Justice that he had bribed Nepali officials.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed the possibility of Sharma’s violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act’s anti-bribery provisions.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentencing in the US court is yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.“The Special Court has ordered the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, the anti-graft body, to launch a separate investigation into Sharma,” said Gyanendra Raj Regmi, spokesperson for the Special Court. “The case is still ongoing and open.”The Special Court bench, with Tek Narayan Kunwar as chair and Tej Narayan Singh Rai and Ritendra Thapa as members, convicted 11 individuals. It concluded that procurement of the two wide-body Airbus jets caused the government a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million). The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the payment of the last instalment in 2018.The court has sentenced Sugat Ratna Kansakar, the former managing director of Nepal Airlines, to two years and nine months in prison and ordered the recovery of Rs122.59 million from him. However, since he is 74, he will receive a 50 percent waiver of sentence under the Senior Citizens Act.The court has sentenced former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari, who acted as the chairman of the Nepal Airlines board, to a year and 9 months in prison and asked him to forfeit Rs122.59 million.Likewise, the court has sentenced former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana and tourism joint secretary Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, who were on the Nepal Airlines board, to a year and six months in jail each, and asked them to forfeit Rs122.59 million each. The bench, however, acquitted the then tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, among others, who had been named as defendants by the anti-corruption body.The court has also sentenced former AAR executive Sharma; Christian Nuehlen, a German citizen and former director of Hi Fly X Ireland Limited, Dublin; and Oleg Calistru, a citizen of Romania and Moldova and former finance director of German Aviation Capital; to a year and six months in prison and asked them to forfeit Rs122.59 million each.Similarly, the court has sentenced John M Holmes, president and chief executive officer of AAR International; Ana Topa, managing director of German Aviation Capital; Paulo Mirpuri, president of Hi Fly Airlines Portugal; and Gerald Thornton, director of Hifly X Ireland Limited a year and six months in prison and asked them to forfeit Rs122.59 million each.The court’s verdict, however, highlights jurisdictional complexities.Regmi, the special court’s spokesperson, said the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002 mandates investigations into bribery involving foreign officials could be conducted by Nepali authorities like the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority.Trials, if any, would also fall under Nepal’s jurisdiction.“If both the countries in question are signatories to mutual legal assistance treaties, they can cooperate in evidence-sharing and issue a formal extradition request to bring the accused to Nepal for a trial,” he said. “In this case, the judgment execution body will begin the trial in absentia and issue lookout notices to the defendants if they do not present themselves in a defined period set by a jury at the time of trial.”However, if neither country is a signatory to mutual legal assistance treaties or extradition treaties, there is also an option. Lawyers say the sentence execution body can send ‘letters rogatory’ to obtain judicial assistance from countries where the people charged with crime live.According to Regmi, if they have an agent, office, or assets in Nepal, they will be seized to recover the financial penalty. “Financial penalty can be recovered if Nepal has a treaty or other agreement with the countries. In the absence of a treaty or other agreement, it is difficult to do so.”In the case of Sharma, the former executive of US-based AAR, it’s unclear how Nepal’s court verdict will be implemented as his case [sentencing] is ongoing in the US, too. Sharma pleaded guilty in the US court and agreed to forfeit around $130,000.Regmi said Nepal can issue international arrest warrants against Sharma and other defendants. In the event of a lookout notice or international warrant, they could be arrested outside Nepal through Interpol.According to the charge sheet filed by the anti-graft body in August, the government officials violated the procurement law by accepting the supplier’s escalation condition to purchase second-hand aircraft, which amounted to $6.78 million (Rs745.8 million) of the $209.6 million valuation.Escalation condition is a rule in a contract that says if certain things change, like prices, the contract terms can also change. Investigators suspect the condition was included in the $209.6 million deal to covertly generate kickbacks for the officials involved.The charge sheet states that while finalising the major technical specifications, the aircraft's maximum takeoff mass (MTOM) was decreased from 242 tonnes to 230 tonnes. Investigators suspect financial embezzlement here.The maximum takeoff mass (weight) affects an aircraft’s takeoff distance, rate of climb, payload capacity, and range.The probe found that the Nepali officials made payment for 242 tonnes but ordered aircraft with a capacity of only 230 tonnes, with a cost difference of $6.6 million (Rs72.5 million).Kansakar has been named the mastermind of the scam.In August 2015, under the leadership of Kansakar, Nepal Airlines began the process of acquiring two wide-body aircraft from the European plane maker. On September 11, 2016, the Finance Ministry agreed to act as a guarantor on a loan Nepal Airlines took to procure the two wide-body jets.On September 24, 2016, the Nepal Airlines’ board unanimously approved its management’s plan to procure two Airbus A330-200 wide-body jets. Subsequently, on September 26, 2016, the national flag carrier invited sealed requests for proposal (RFP) from aircraft manufacturing companies, airlines, aircraft leasing companies, and bankers to purchase two A330-200 jets.Separately, the documents made public by the US court show that Sharma had a close connection with a top Nepal Airlines official. A month before the national flag carrier invited sealed requests for proposals (RFP), or on September 1, 2016, a top Nepal Airlines official sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify the MOU signing date, purchase agreement date, and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, the Nepal Airlines official texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”When everything was moving swiftly, Kansakar held a press conference in Kathmandu to say they had found cheaper planes, resulting in considerable savings, which raised many eyebrows.Later, the bid documents said the minimum age of the proposed aircraft cannot be more than 1,000 flight hours, and the date of manufacture should not be before January 2014.In the verdict text, the court argued that Airbus could not sell used planes and that the motive for the dubious deal was evident right from the start.It was informed that the board’s decision to allow Nepal Airlines to buy the jets from the European aviation giant followed the management’s recommendation to switch from Boeing to Airbus, as a one-family aircraft strategy would reduce maintenance and crew training costs. \nThe Health Foundation Nepal (HFN), a non-profit established in 2013 by Nepali doctors in the United States, hosted its 12th annual conference on December 7 in Greensboro, North Carolina.Committed to improving healthcare for underserved communities in Nepal, HFN has been instrumental in addressing disparities in community and mental health and combating non-communicable diseases through its programmes in the Dang and Chitwan districts.One of its notable initiatives, Khushi Ba Ama, provides comprehensive support to senior citizens over 60, addressing both their healthcare and social needs.During the Annual Scientific Meeting, Dr. Shreedhar Paudel, HFN’s chairperson, underscored the organisation's achievements and outlined plans to expand collaborations with the Nepali government and other stakeholders to enhance healthcare initiatives.The conference also featured discussions on global and mental health advancements, with presentations covering topics such as cultural competence in mental health care and the prevalence of depression among Nepali medical students, reflecting HFN’s decade-long impact. \nNearly 30 percent of doctors who completed their master’s degree and sat a recent licensing test of the Nepal Medical Council failed to score the pass mark.According to the council, the national regulatory body of medical doctors, only 175 out of 275 doctors who appeared for the exam passed the licensing test held on Thursday.“Only those who secure the pass mark become specialist doctors,” said Dr Chop Lal Bhusal, chairman of the council. “Those who fail the licensing test have to retake the exam.”The council conducts the licensing test for postgraduate doctors every four months. Those who fail can retake the exam until they pass.This is not the first time such a large number of doctors have failed to secure the minimum pass mark needed to practise as consultant doctors. Officials at the council said the average pass percentage for postgraduate doctors is around 70.“Only 50 to 55 percent of doctors with an MBBS degree pass the licensing test, while around 70 percent of postgraduate doctors pass,” said Bhusal. “What is worrying is a lot of doctors with master’s degrees are failing to secure even the pass marks.”To qualify as a medical practitioner, a doctor must secure at least 50 percent in the licensing exam. Experts say the quality of medical education is being compromised by underachievers who do not deserve to practise medicine entering the profession. “Universities and colleges must pay closer attention to the results of the doctors they produce,” said Bhusal. Licensing tests for medical doctors are a routine procedure in every country. Nepal’s licensing test focuses only on doctors’ knowledge. Some countries also conduct skill tests. Council officials said they had also planned to conduct skill tests in the past, but could not due to the lack of skill labs.“Only the National Academy of Medical Sciences;, Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine; and Kathmandu University’s Dhulikhel Hospital have skill labs,” said Dr Krishna Prasad Adhikari, former registrar of the Council. “We had planned to set up skill labs with support from various agencies, including the World Health Organisation, but things didn’t go as planned.”The World Health Organisation said inaccurate diagnosis, medical errors, inappropriate or unnecessary treatment, inadequate or unsafe clinical facilities and practices, and healthcare providers who lack adequate training and expertise are present in all countries. The UN health body says low-quality health care is increasing the burden of illness and health costs globally. \nThe Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, which has been running a human milk bank, is now providing breast milk to vulnerable infants born in other hospitals.Doctors at the hospital said the purpose of the milk bank is to save infants' lives, regardless of where they are born.“Human breast milk is required for vulnerable infants—those whose mothers died during or after giving birth, critically ill newborns in neonatal intensive care units, premature babies with low birth weights,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, director at the hospital. “We have been supplying breast milk to such infants in other hospitals, including Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Patan Hospital, Norvic Hospital, and B&B Hospital, among others.”The human milk bank, launched some two years ago at the hospital, aims to reduce neonatal deaths, which remains constantly high. Since 2016, neonatal deaths have not declined, despite various measures implemented by health authorities.According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births.Doctors say feeding low-weight babies and critically ill neonates in intensive care units can significantly reduce the risk of infections. The bank collects, tests, pasteurises and stores donor milk from lactating mothers.“The milk is collected mostly from the mothers of ailing babies, who cannot breastfeed their infants admitted to the intensive care units,” said Dr Sailendra Bir Karmacharya, a senior consultant paediatrician of the hospital. “We provide milk only to infants weighing less than 1,000 grams.”According to doctors, human breast milk contains the best source of nutrition and ensures the survival and healthy growth of babies. It bolsters brain development and has lifelong benefits for both the baby and the mother.Karmacharya said that human milk helps in reducing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal problem that mostly affects premature babies. Officials said the hospital needs 1.5 to 2.5 litres of breast milk for babies admitted to the intensive care unit. The human milk bank collects milk directly from mothers of hospitalised babies, but it collects only surplus milk from other lactating mothers, which is then tested, pasteurised and stored at minus 40 degrees Celsius. The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. The 16th five-year periodic plan, which ends in 2029, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from 21 per 1,000 live births. The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes, including hiring staff nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding has the potential to prevent 13 percent of under-five deaths. Studies show that Nepal's exclusive breastfeeding rate has steadily declined over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022, exclusive breastfeeding dropped consistently from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It stated that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), compared to 12 percent of those born at home.Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is prone to contamination and increases the risk of diseases in children, according to the World Health Organisation.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to breastfeed their babies, as studies show. The report shows that the proportion of children who are bottle-fed increases with mothers’ education, rising from 12 percent among children of mothers with no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Bottle-feeding is most common in the highest wealth quintile—46 percent—and least common in the lowest wealth quintile—11 percent.Among the seven provinces of Nepal, exclusive breastfeeding rates are the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest at 11 percent in Karnali Province, 12 percent in Madhesh Province and the highest at 43 percent in Bagmati Province.Doctors recommend breastfeeding for the first two years of a baby’s life or longer, as breast milk lowers the risk of illness in children, promotes their recovery during illness, and provides important nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nEminent city doctors and health experts today gave a call for caution, mass awareness and improved government policies to minimise the use of microplastics that can cause several health hazards, including cancer.Tiny plastic particles that are less than 5 mm are called microplastics and are being attributed to severe respiratory diseases or even some types of cancer. According to Dr Monidipa Mondal, an eminent radiation oncologist, when microplastics enter the body through food or other sources, they first encounter the immune cells. “Being micro-mini in size, they can easily enter the immune cells after which a biochemical agent called cyclophane is released. The cyclophanes prepare chronic information inside the cells. “As we know if chronic information continues to get stored in the cells, it can lead to cancer. Apart from this, cancer is also related to free radicals. Therefore, it also creates oxidative stress in the cells and free radicals in the cells due to which cell multiplication occurs,” informed the doctor.As reiterated by Dr Mondal, recent studies have revealed an increased number of colorectal cancers among people. “It has been found in some studies that microplastics could be a possible driver of colorectal cancer. Another observation reveals a link between breast cancer and microplastic. We have also heard about BPA-free plastic. BPA or Bisphenol-A is an agent that can mimic estrogen. In some cancer cases, estrogen has been found. It can, therefore, be said that if it can mimic estrogen, it could also be a possible cause of breast cancer,” she added.According to research by India Clean Air Network (India CAN), degraded plastic from waste and wastewater discharge due to inefficient treatment processes are two of the major sources of microplastics in West Bengal entering the human body in various ways. The health experts recommended stronger and improved government policies to curb the menace of plastic. As pointed out by Professor Sadhan K Ghosh, mass awareness, particularly among young students is the need of the hour. “The first need is waste segregation. Second, the governance should be such that microplastics are not created for which legislation and its implementation must be done. Also, as plastic becomes brittle and enters our body while swimming or is even consumed by fish that we eat, littering sea beaches should be prohibited,” pointed out the professor.-In Association with ANN \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nJanakpur Bolts continued their unbeaten run in the Nepal Premier League T20 cricket tournament as they overcame Lumbini Lions by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Sunday.Defending a modest 136, Janakpur narrowly held off Lumbini’s pursuit, restricting them to 135-8, with Canadian allrounder Harsh Thaker emerging as the hero to deliver a sensational final over to deny Sundeep Jora the winning run in the morning.Thaker returned astonishing match figures of 5-23 in his magical four-over spell that also included the key wickets of skipper Rohit Paudel (35 off 38), Tom Moores (31 off 23), Bibek Yadav (0) and Saad Bin Zafar (0).The clash reached its climax with Lumbini needing just two runs off the final ball. Jora, who had brought Lumbini tantalisingly close hammering 13 runs off Kishore Mahato in the 19th over, should have overhauled the target or at least collected a run to push the match into the Super Over. Instead, the wicketkeeper-batter attempted an ambitious boundary (or six) and was caught in the deep by Kishore Mahato after Thaker top-edged him.Jora had earlier escaped a run-out on the penultimate ball and was offered a chance to give Lumbini their first victory due to a misfield by Sher Malla but fell heartbreakingly short.Earlier, Anil Sah and Aasif Sheikh added 48 runs for the opening wicket to give Janakpur a strong start after being invited to bat first.Sheikh fell to Zafar (2-11) in the 5.3 overs after scoring 16 runs off 10 balls.Sah then partnered with Lahiru Milantha to share a 47-run partnership for the second wicket to continue the momentum.However, Lumbini’s bowlers hit back hard as Janakpur lost six wickets for just 15 runs, thanks to Abhishesh Gautam’s triple strike and two crucial scalps from skipper Paudel.A late cameo from Shubh Kansakar (22 not out off 24) ensured Janakpur post 136-9.The outcome gave Janakpur a fourth victory on the trot and helped them reclaim the top spot with eight points.Meanwhile, Lumbini’s fourth consecutive loss leaves them rooted at the bottom of the eight-team table, still searching for their first win.Missed chance Sudurpaschim missed their chance to go level on points with Janakpur after Chitwan Rhinos inflicted them their first loss of the tournament, winning by 33 runs later in the afternoon.Chasing 165 for win, Sudupraschim crumbled under pressure and were bowled out for 131.Sudurpaschim started their innings aggressively, with Saif Zaib cracking three fours in a quickfire 18 off 11 balls.Sudurpaschim’s troubles began when Rijan Dhakal (2-33) dismissed Zaib in the last ball of the second over.Binod Bhandari and Brandon McMullen tried to stabilise the innings but Kushal Malla (2-18) dismantled their efforts, removing both batters in the fifth over to leave Sudurpaschim teetering at 45-3.Aarif Sheikh also departed cheaply for four, trapped lbw by Ranjit Kumar.Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton then inflicted critical damage, dismissing Dilpreet Dajwa (12) and Dipendra Singh Airee (1) to reduce Sudurpaschim to 73-6.Ishan Pandey’s spirited 35 runs off 28 balls pushed the chase past the 100-run mark but Amar Routela halted the progress with a double strike in the 16th over, dispatching Naresh Budayair (5) and Pandey.A late effort from Naren Saud (10 off 8) and Scott Kuggeleijn (16 off 10) provided some hope but Dhakal’s catch-and-bowl dismissal of Saud and Tanvir’s lbw to Kuggeleijn sealed the game for Chitwan.Earlier, a half-century from Hassan Eisakhil helped Chitwan, who opted to bat first, post 164-5 from their 20 overs.Eisakhil steadied the innings with a well-crafted 65 off 52 balls after the early loss of opener Santosh Karki (9).Bipin Rawan supported Eisakhil with 17 off 20 in their 50-run stand, and Malla later assisted him with 13 off 16.Kuggeleijn removed both Rawal, Eisakhil and Malla to halt the progress.But Ravi Bopara added late fireworks with a blistering 36 off 18 to propel Chitwan to a competitive total.The result places Chitwan third in the standings, tied on points with Sudurpaschim, who remain in second place despite their defeat. \nChitwan Rhinos handed Sudurpaschim Royals their first defeat in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) on Sunday, securing a 33-run victory in the second match of the day at Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.Batting first after winning the toss, Chitwan posted a competitive total of 164 runs for the loss of five wickets in their allotted 20 overs. Opener Hassan Eisakhil led the charge with an impressive 65 runs off 52 balls, smashing six fours and three sixes. Ravi Bopara contributed 36 runs off 18 balls, including two sixes and two fours.For Sudurpaschim, Scott Kuggeleijn took two wickets, while Dipendra Singh Airee, Brandon McMullen, and Saif Zaib each claimed one.In reply, Sudurpaschim were bowled out for 131 runs in 18.2 overs. Ishan Pandey top-scored with 35 runs off 28 balls, hitting four fours and a six, before being caught off Amar Routela’s bowling. Contributions from Saif Zaib (18), Brandon McMullen (13), and Dilpreet Bajwa (12) fell short as the batting lineup struggled against Chitwan’s disciplined bowling attack.Chitwan’s bowlers shared the spoils, with Kushal Malla, Jean Nicol Leask, Rijan Dhakal, and Amar Rautela taking two wickets each. Sohail Tanvir and Ranjit Kumar chipped in with a wicket apiece.,The win places Chitwan Rhinos in third position on the points table with six points from four matches, while Sudurpaschim Royals hold the second spot due to a superior net run rate. Janakpur Bolts remain unbeaten at the top with eight points.In the earlier match, Janakpur Bolts narrowly defeated Lumbini Lions by one run in a thrilling contest. \nChitwan Rhinos posted a total of 164 runs for the loss of 5 wickets in their allotted 20 overs against Sudurpaschim Royals in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) match at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.Winning the toss and opting to bat first, Chitwan were led by opener Hassan Eishakhil’s impressive knock of 65 runs off 52 balls, which included 6 boundaries and 3 sixes. Hassan was dismissed by Scott Kuggeleijn, caught by Naresh Budhayer.Ravi Bopara added 36 runs off just 18 balls with 2 fours and 2 sixes before being caught by Naren Saud off Dipendra Singh Airee’s delivery. Bipin Rawal contributed 17 runs but fell to Kuggeleijn, caught by Saif Zaib.Among other batters, Santosh Karki scored 9 runs, while captain Kushal Malla managed 13 before being bowled by Kuggeleijn. Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton (2*) and Amar Routela (6*) remained unbeaten.For Sudurpaschim, Scott Kuggeleijn was the standout bowler, claiming 2 wickets. Dipendra Singh Airee, Brandon McMullen, and Saif Zaib picked up one wicket each.Chitwan made two changes to their squad, bringing in Hassan Eishakhil and Ranjit Kumar in place of Sharad Vesawkar and Luke Wankekestain. Sudurpaschim replaced Basant Khatri with Dilpreet Bajwa in their playing XI. \nJanakpur Bolts clinched a dramatic 1-run victory against Lumbini Lions in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) match at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, strengthening their playoff prospects while leaving Lumbini’s hopes hanging by a thread.Chasing a target of 137 runs set by Janakpur, Lumbini managed only 135 runs for the loss of 7 wickets in their allotted 20 overs. With 2 runs needed off the final ball, Sundeep Jora was caught out, sealing Janakpur’s fourth consecutive win.Lumbini’s captain Rohit Paudel top-scored with 35 runs off 38 balls, including three boundaries, but lacked sufficient support. Tom Moores added 31 runs, while Arjun Saud chipped in with 20. Harsh Thaker led Janakpur’s bowling attack with a remarkable 5-wicket haul, conceding just 23 runs. Lalit Rajbanshi, Kishore Mahato, and Sher Malla claimed a wicket each.Earlier, Janakpur, after being put to bat, posted 136 runs for the loss of 9 wickets. Captain Anil Kumar Sah was the standout performer with 45 runs off 39 balls, smashing four sixes and one boundary. Shubh Kansakar remained unbeaten on 22.Lumbini debutant Abhishesh Gautam impressed with a triple strike in one over, dismissing Lahiru Milantha (24), Harsh Thaker (1), and James Neesham (0). He conceded 20 runs in his full quota of 4 overs. Captain Rohit Paudel and Saad Zafar claimed two wickets each, while Jora contributed one.With this win, Janakpur now leads the points table with 8 points from 4 matches, boosting their playoff chances. Meanwhile, Lumbini, still winless after four games, are at the bottom of the standings, making their road to the playoffs extremely difficult.Lumbini must win all their remaining three matches and hope for favourable results from other fixtures to keep their slim playoff hopes alive. \nIn Kathmandu, kite flying, a centuries-old tradition with religious and cultural significance, once flourished during Dashain and Nag Panchami seasons, but has declined due to urbanization, technology, and limited open spaces.\nSince 13th century, Kumaris, young girls from the Shakya/Bajracharya community, have been worshipped as goddesses in Nepal; a tradition with modern reforms including education and later life support, despite ongoing legal challenges.\nJuddha Shumsher Rana built a private zoo in the mid-1930s at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, featuring a diverse collection of mammals, reptiles, fishes, and birds, including tigers, rhinoceroses, leopards, deer, bears, and peacocks. Under government management since 1956, the zoo has expanded and now houses numerous animal species for entertainment, conservation, and educational purposes.\nHealthy plants repel pests and diseases due to high Brix levels, which are maintained by beneficial soil microbes; chemical pesticides disrupt these microbial systems, leading to plant vulnerability and increased pest attacks.\nThe Government of Nepal's draft National Book Policy aims to improve book quality and availability through a National Book Council and financial support for book production and libraries, but critics argue that existing institutions and stakeholders should be supported instead of creating new entities.\nTo its credit, the team of KP Sharma Oli in Beijing somehow convinced the Chinese to sign the BRI framework agreement on Wednesday. The Chinese don’t do hasty negotiations. A day earlier, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had met his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang. On the same evening, there was a meeting between Oli and Chinese President Xi Jinping. A joint statement was issued later in the day, outlining all the major developments of Oli’s trip. The much-hyped framework for BRI cooperation had found no mention in the statement. China watchers back home started bemoaning the ‘abject failure’ of Oli’s China trip. But then Team Oli, which included his chief advisor Bishnu Rimal and chief economic advisor Yubaraj Khatiwada, pulled a rabbit out of the bag.The final terminology used to describe the money that will come into Nepal under the BRI rubric has some ambiguity, as ‘aid financing modalities’ can include both grants and loans. But then, such in-between terminologies are common in bilateral negotiations where each side is looking to keep certain constituencies back home happy. The important thing is that both the top leaders of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties in the country, agreed on the term. And when it was presented to the Chinese, so did they. The ‘aid financing modalities’ do not preclude all kinds of loans. In fact, the understanding seems to be that the term means that Nepal will consider low-interest loans such as it was getting from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. That is how it should be. How can Nepal accept loans from the rest of the world but shun it from China? The Congress leadership also seems to have realised the flaw in its earlier reasoning that no kind of loan from China was acceptable. The good thing is that the agreement with China is likely to last as it has the backing of the country’s two major parties, who together make nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority. It was the differences between these two on loans from China that helped them flesh out the outstanding issues over the BRI framework. This in turn added clarity to the issues. (Some differences on the BRI persist inside the Congress, but that is to be expected in a democratic party.) Perhaps the Chinese this time thought that even though they were being asked to hurry, the proposal on the table, which had the backing of Nepal’s two major political parties, was worth signing. There are still many unknowns about the BRI. But at least Nepal stood its ground when necessary, while also not being rigid. This signals a maturing of Nepali diplomacy. After the BRI framework agreement, we again hope that the Congress and the UML and other parties can come to similar understandings on Nepal’s relations with India and the US–and on Nepal’s other vital ties. Consensual foreign policy is the need of the hour. Right now, it is worth celebrating that China, which harboured deep suspicions of the Congress, will be more amenable to dealing with Nepal’s biggest party. Their mutual suspicions were poisoning Nepal-China relations. Perhaps the long-stuck train of the BRI in Nepal will now finally start chugging.  \nWith the by-elections to elect 44 local representatives in 32 districts done and dusted, reviews and analysis of the final results are pouring in thick and fast. Given the palpable discontent against the parties from across the political spectrum, predicting the bypolls results was not easy. Leaders from the CPN (Maoist Centre) have been in a celebratory mood since Tuesday after winning a couple of important seats after years of electoral setbacks. The former rebel outfit that emerged the clear first party in the 2008 general elections had been consistently losing votes and seats in subsequent polls.On the other hand, leaders from the CPN-UML don’t appear excited despite the party winning some important office bearer positions in different local units. The Nepali Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, lost some key positions in a few units as well. Unhappy with the results, the two largest parties have decided to review the outcomes through the respective party mechanisms.One noteworthy feature of the recent bypolls was that voters this time showed little faith in the new forces, unlike in the previous polls. Traditional fringe parties like the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party and the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist) that failed to get national party status in parliament in the last general elections picked up a seat each this time. But new forces such as the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Janamat Party didn’t do well. The RSP won only a ward chair in Kathmandu while the votes garnered by its candidates in other local units were negligible. The RSP, which emerged the fourth largest force in 2022 barely six months after its formation, had done better in the by-elections in April 2023. However, it couldn’t maintain the momentum when a by-election was held to elect a federal lawmaker from Ilam in April this year. The Janamat Party, another outfit that emerged from the last general election, failed to get even a single seat this time. Interestingly, the voters also discarded forces like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party that champions revival of the Hindu monarchy. The pro-monarchy party, the fifth largest in the federal legislature, didn’t win a single seat in Sunday by-polls.For long-term success, a political party needs to have clarity in its agenda and vision, a robust organisation, and strong bond with the general people. Elections are key yardsticks to gauge whether a political party has these strengths. There is broad consensus that the public is disenchanted with major political forces like the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre that have ruled this country by turns for the past two decades. People in previous elections gave a chance to new outfits as they were frustrated by the old forces’ failure to deliver. The level of support these new forces got was perhaps not an endorsement of their vision and agenda, which are sketchy. While these forces succeeded in fanning anger against the incumbents, they failed to offer anything better. Experts caution against drawing hasty conclusions based on the results of elections held for just 44 local level seats. Yet the by-polls were held across all seven provinces, and covered the capital city Kathmandu to remote villages, hills to plains, east to west. In sum, Nepalis are giving a clear message to the political forces old and new: do not take our support for granted.  \nIn under four months, tenth graders all over Nepal will appear in the School Education Examination (SEE). This is a time for students to focus on final preparations. Sadly, hard work alone won’t yield better results when the schools and curriculum fail to cater to their needs. Every year, when the results are out, many students have to endure crushing failure. However, as in previous years, the authorities have failed to learn from their mistakes. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is making baseless predictions of a 70 percent pass rate in the upcoming SEE. How will this be achieved in a country where pass rates have for years hovered below 50 percent?Among 464,785 students who appeared in the last SEE, only 222,472—47.87 percent—secured a Grade Point Average (GPA) above 1.60, which is necessary to study at a higher level. However, 242,313 students—52.13 percent—were categorised as non-graded. After the supplementary exams, over a third of them were graded, qualifying them to study in grade 11. Oli’s forecast is only plausible if the results improve by around 50 percent, which is unlikely. The grading system was introduced in 2016 to reform the examination system, focusing less on marks and more on interactive learning. But the hangover of the old School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exams persists. While the system has been upgraded, the teaching and learning are still the same. Schools are grappling with a shortage of teachers for major subjects like Science, Mathematics and English. Rural provinces like Karnali have suffered the most and some schools are hiring under-qualified teachers to fill the gaps. With teachers unable to address their problems, students have no choice but to rely on rote learning. To cope, the government is focusing on extra online classes. But such online classes for school students hold only symbolic value. In Nepal, fear has always been a tool for teaching and learning. Most schools do not foster an environment where students enjoy learning. This mentality also applies to how the education system views examinations like SEE. Students are put under pressure to perform well, as if it were a “do or die” situation. The shame of failure scars students for life. Some private schools take advantage of this fragile emotional state of students by enforcing mandatory tuition classes. Further, as schools in rural areas can’t complete the syllabus on time, it creates an opportunity for private tuition centres to generate profit as students migrate a few months before SEE to study in such centres. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres.Schedule 8 of the constitution gives local units the authority to manage school education. But the lack of a Federal Education Act, a must to implement constitutional provisions, is a big hurdle towards this laudable goal. Among its various flaws, the controversial Education Bill, registered in Parliament last year, fails to establish minimum criteria for establishing schools. The government must realise that the basics must be fulfilled before setting lofty goals. There must be mechanisms to recruit qualified teachers and retain them. It is also imperative to update the pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. The SEE marks the culmination of over a decade of schooling. Therefore, it is unfair to blame the students who have trusted the system for long. The poor SEE results are a direct reflection of the system’s failure. Whether we have the SEE or the SLC, the flawed education system will continue to jeopardise the future of hundreds of thousands of young students.  \nThe Nepal Premier League, which kicked off on Saturday, has taken the country by storm. Never before had a national-level tournament created such buzz among domestic and international audiences. Nepali cricket fanbase, who grew up watching the Indian Premier League, are now ecstatic to have their own truly international franchise league comprising no less than eight teams. The fact that people from different parts of the country are travelling to the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground to cheer on their favourite teams speaks volumes about the tournament’s mass appeal.The ‘Festival of Himalayas’ features big cricketing names like former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham, Dutch Michael Levitt, Namibia’s Gerhard Erasmus, and Australia’s Ben Cutting. Nepali cricketers—both national players and newcomers—will now get to rub shoulders with these global cricket superstars, which will greatly boost their confidence. The NPL will also hopefully offer these players enough financial incentives to pursue cricket as a profession. In fact, the recent all-format international success of the Indian national team is often attributed to the IPL, for some of the same reasons. The start of the NPL this year could thus mark a sea-change in Nepal’s success in international cricket. The league will have a global audience after getting the Star Sports Network, an internationally established TV network, as the official broadcaster; and after partnering with the Twenty-first Century Media Sports, a company that has managed many international events. They will help showcase Nepal as a global cricket destination. No wonder Nepali cricket fans are upbeat. As one fan placard during Saturday’s opening match between Janakpur Bolts and Biratnagar Kings put it: “No matter who wins it is the victory of Nepali cricket.”Done well, the NPL’s success will resonate much beyond the international sports scene. The vast majority of Nepali youths are looking to leave the country the first opportunity they get. They see no hope in their country. But when they see that cricketers and commentators and organisers from around the world are coming to their homeland to play as professionals, perhaps this feeling of disenchantment with their native country will go down a bit. Additionally, if Nepal can successfully pull off an international tournament like the NPL, there is no reason this welcoming country cannot host tournaments like the cricket Asia Cup. But there will also be challenges. The Cricket Association of Nepal has taken up the monumental task of organising an eight-team tournament. The association’s history of managing similar tournaments is checkered. For instance, the CAN-organised Nepal T20 League in 2022-23 was marred by controversies even before it kicked off due to allegations about match-fixing. The body has also faced criticisms for negligence, delayed payments and incompetence. Even in the opening match of the NPL on Saturday, the association failed to manage the crowd, which in turn led to injuries. The next day, fans were seen running on to the cricket pitch at the completion of a match. In order to maintain the integrity of Nepali cricket, it is vital to minimise such incidents. Hopefully, the CAN is learning with every match. The CAN must get the NPL right, for the tournament’s benefits are potentially limitless. The millions of international TV viewers of the NPL will get to see what a beautiful country Nepal is and this in turn could boost the country’s tourism prospects. The NPL itself, linked to a multitude of stakeholders, can create many profitable jobs, especially as other stadiums are built and the tournament expands to other parts of Nepal. Exciting times, indeed.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nOn Sunday the weather in Koshi Province along with the hilly regions of the country is forecast to be partly cloudy while the rest of the province is to remain partly cloudy to mainly fair.Light rain is likely to occur at one or two places of hilly regions of Koshi, Gandaki, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAs the CPN (Maoist Centre) gears up to bring Nanda Bahadur Pun, Nepal’s two-term former Vice-president, into active party politics, the move has reignited the longstanding debate over whether former Presidents and Vice Presidents should rejoin politics.Earlier, former President Bidya Devi Bhandari was said to be considering returning to active politics, but this has yet to materialise. Bhandari relinquished her party role as vice chair when she became the country’s first female President. According to Maoist Centre leaders, the party is also considering involving Amik Sherchan, a former provincial head, in active politics. Sherchan, however, said the party is yet to discuss the matter with him. “Whether people who have previously held constitutional positions like President, Vice President, and Provincial head can join active politics should be decided only after a vigorous debate,” Sherchan said.“You occupy the constitutional position by relinquishing party membership. So after completing your constitutional role, should you be allowed to return to the party’s fold?” Sherchan told the Post. “What precedent do we want to set? We need to consider these questions.” While Sherchan says there has been no official discussion on his return to active politics, Pun, the former Vice-president, claims that he has already rejoined his former party. According to Maoist Centre leaders, Pun has been participating in many party functions and events, and a formal announcement will soon be made. There are multiple examples of leaders returning to politics after completing their tenures in high state offices. But a Maoist Centre leader says this should not be allowed in the case of former Presidents, Vice-presidents, or even Provincial heads.“If we make such decisions, other political parties could follow suit, which may backfire for our party in the long run,” the leader said on the condition of anonymity. The leader believes such a practice should be discouraged to preserve the democratic spirit even though the constitution does not explicitly prohibit it. A section of the Maoist Centre also believes that by bringing back Pun, party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who of late has enjoyed good relations with former President Bidya Devi Bhandari, is trying to facilitate her return to the CPN-UML. “Former President Bhandari, who is trying to return to active politics, however, is facing hurdles, as her possible return came to be widely criticised, including by UML leaders,” another Maoist Centre leader said on the condition of anonymity. “Bringing back Pun, who was Vice-President when Bhandari was the President, can smoothen her way into the party politics.” If Bhandari rejoins active politics and becomes the UML head, Dahal might consider unifying the Maoist Centre and the UML, as happened in 2018. The Nepal Communist Party, born of the merger, split in 2021. However, Maoist Centre Secretary Ram Karki says when people are clamouring for new faces in politics, old faces rejoining politics will be meaningless. “Even a unification of the UML and Maoist Centre will have no impact on the communist movement, as neither party is truly communist anymore,” Karki said.Mahesh Bartaula, the UML chief whip, says it is up to the respective former President or Vice-President to make the call, as there is no constitutional bar. “That being the case, I also need no need for one former politician to facilitate the re-entry into politics of another former politician,” Bartaula said. Maoist Centre politburo member Yubraj Chaulagain denies that the party is considering bringing back Pun into active politics in order to help Bhandari. But he believes that should the party make such a decision, it could set a bad precedent. “The Maoist Centre should not make such decisions that could have long-term repercussions for the party,” Chaulagain told the Post. “Other parties could benefit from the Maoist Centre's decision by using it as a justification for similar moves that may be unpopular or controversial, but serve their own interests.”Chaulagain said there had been no such discussions in the party on the issue. Bhandari and Pun became the country’s President and Vice-President soon after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. They held their positions for almost seven years before Ram Chandra Paudel and Ram Saya Yadav, respectively, succeeded them in early 2023. Nepal’s Constitution does not explicitly bar a former head of state from engaging in active politics after leaving office. However, constitutional experts say this is a matter of moral ethics. “In other countries, former heads and deputy heads of state do not return to active politics. It is a question of ethics,” Raman Shrestha, a former attorney general, said.But some Maoist leaders believe Dahal is trying to bring Pun into active politics to strengthen his own position in the party. Deputy general secretaries Barshaman Pun and Janardan Sharma, who used to be stalwarts of Dahal, have now become harsh critics of the party leader. They even questioned Dahal's working style and raised the issue of leadership transfer within the party. Maoist Centre chair Dahal has long been navigating internal conflicts, using strategic manoeuvres to maintain control. Earlier, he played rivals Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya against each other. When Bahattrai and Baidya left the party, Dahal played Barshaman and Janardhan against each other, but this too did not last. During the party’s standing committee meeting in August, deputy general secretary Barshaman and Janardhan stood against the party chair. A Maoist leader said that to counter the growing challenge within the party, Dahal is considering giving former Vice-preisdent Pun an important role. The possibility is that former vice-president Pun will be given the role of senior-vice-president, said the leader. “Chairman Dahal does not want to lose the majority in the party. He is trying to gain control in various ways, including by bringing back Pun and Amik Sherchan,” another party leader said on the condition of anonymity.  \nNepal appears desperate to build a multi-million dollar cross-border liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline project and has started serious homework for the same.However, there is a paradox in the policy.Nepal is also preparing a 12-year plan to boost energy production and expand the market. The target is to produce over 28,000MW of electricity by 2035.Electric stoves are considered safer than LPG stoves as they do not have an open flame or combustible fuel source. The clear winner, however, will be LPG, as, according to experts, politicians have been lobbying for the gas pipeline without proper homework on the future of hydro and its investment.Nepal's petroleum import bill stood at Rs337.34 billion in the last fiscal, of which Rs55.61 billion was spent on cooking gas.Last week, Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari visited New Delhi, India, where a discussion was held on building a cross-border gas pipeline with Hardeep S Puri, India’s Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas.The ministers agreed ‘in principle’ to move forward with the project.Nepal has already chosen a site in Sarlahi, and the pipeline will come there from Motihari, India. “Once the project’s estimated cost is finalised, the two governments will decide on the funding modality,” said Baburam Adhikari, joint secretary of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. Nepal had requested the Indian government to build the LPG pipeline on grant. However, insiders say, as in the case of petroleum supply, Nepal should sign a long-term LPG supply agreement with India to make the project viable.If the government pushes for the LPG pipeline, what will be the future of hydropower, and what will happen to the government plan to use hydroelectricity in households?“That’s is not a good idea,” said Ganesh Karki, president of the Independent Power Producers’ Association, Nepal. The government should instead focus on increasing the country's power production and its domestic consumption, he said.Experts say reducing LPG imports by around Rs50 billion will help narrow the ballooning trade deficit.“We should not be dependent on LPG from India. We need to reduce its imports by prioritising electricity consumption,” said Karki.“Such LPG pipeline projects will take Nepal nowhere. We are spending billions to import LPG, which will obviously impact Nepal’s hydropower development,” said Karki. “If we promote fossil fuels and LPG imports, why would investors inject funds into hydro development?”The industry ministry and Nepal Oil Corporation officials say India is positive about supporting the construction of the Motihari-Sarlahi LPG project.Nepal buys all of its cooking gas from India, supplied by gas bullets.Nepal has been approaching India for the LPG pipeline construction since 2015 when the southern neighbour imposed a trade blockade.The India blockade, which began on September 23, 2015, and lasted about six months, was an economic and humanitarian crisis that severely affected Nepal and its economy.The cross-border LPG and oil pipelines were envisaged when Nepal suffered from an acute power shortage.In January 2015, the then Commerce Minister Sunil Bahadur Thapa and then Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan of India agreed to send an Indian technical team to Nepal to study the feasibility of setting up LPG and natural gas pipeline infrastructure from India to Nepal.Construction on the project began in April 2018 and was completed in April 2020.Now, with a hydro energy surplus, Nepal no longer needs an LPG pipeline, warn hydro investors.Observers say the LPG pipeline project could make Nepal more dependent on fossil fuels. In the coming years, the country will have abundant renewable energy to power the transport sector as well as energy-efficient electric stoves in its kitchens.An energy expert working on a government project, who wished not to be named, told the Post in August that building an LPG pipeline is another blunder. “Nepal will soon see a considerable amount of electricity generation that could substitute cooking gas and reduce trade deficit.”Environmentalists, too, have been saying that Nepal’s private sector is aggressively investing in hydropower, and the government’s investment in petroleum infrastructure could be a setback for them and the country.The government also has a goal of installing 500,000 improved cooking stoves, primarily in rural areas, and an additional 200,000 household biogas plants and 500 large-scale biogas plants.Nepal’s strategy is to have electric stoves as the primary cooking method in 25 percent of households by 2030.To meet this target, Nepal would need to invest $25 billion, according to estimates.According to Nepal’s National Statistics Office, among the 6.66 million households in the country, 51 percent use firewood and 44.3 percent use LPG in their kitchens.Among other types of cooking fuels, 0.5 percent of the families use electricity, 2.9 percent use dung cakes, 1.2 percent use biogas and 0.1 percent use kerosene or other fuels.Bagmati province, which contains Kathmandu Valley and has 1.56 million households, leads in LPG consumption, with 69.8 percent of the families using it for cooking.Besides the proposed LPG pipeline, in August, Nepal and India agreed on projects for an oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa, a greenfield tank terminal in Charali, and on an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan. \nNepal has banned additional three hazardous pesticides—paraquat dichloride, chlorpyrifos and phorate—which are not only being used to kill pests but are also being misused for suicide.“The Pesticide Management Committee has decided to prohibit the production, synthesis, export, import, transport, commercial use, storage, and sale of the said pesticides in the country,” reads the order published in the Nepal Gazette on Thursday.Poison ingestion, mostly involving pesticides, is the second leading cause of suicide in Nepal after hanging. According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 952 people killed themselves by consuming poison in the fiscal year 2023-24. “Poison is easily available in every household in rural areas across the country, as farmers often keep it in the house to use in crops,” said Dr Dilli Ram Sharma, former director general at the Department of Agriculture. “These hazardous substances are easily available in agri-veterinary shops and are not only being used in plants but also for suicide in our country.”Earlier, in 2018, the country banned eight pesticides—carbofuran, dichlorvos, triazophos, carbaryl, benomyl, carbosulfan, dicofol, and aluminum phosphide. Following the ban, suicides by poison ingestion have dramatically declined, according to Nepal Police report.Police data show that 1,320 people died by poison ingestion in 2018-19, the year authorities banned eight pesticides commonly used for suicide. The numbers dropped to 1,136 in 2019-20; 1,276 in 2020-21; 1040 in 2021-22 and 932 in 2022-23. Sharma said that traders can sell their existing stock of banned poisonous substances for up to two years, but cannot import more.“These pesticides are so hazardous that they can cause cancer, paralysis, renal failure, heart diseases in children, and deformities in newborn babies if used for a long time,” said Sharma. “Many countries, including India, have banned these pesticides.”After the ban on aluminium phosphide in 2018, people in crisis began ingesting chlorpyrifos, which is widely available on the market. Studies show that banning highly hazardous pesticides is a cost-effective and affordable intervention to reduce suicide rates. Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates. The country witnessed an alarming rise in suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year. “Restricting access to commonly used hazardous pesticides will help reduce deaths from suicides,” said Dr Rakesh Ghimire, principal investigator of Nepal for the Center for Pesticide Suicide Prevention at the University of Edinburgh of the United Kingdom, which has been carrying out research on suicides by poison ingestion in Nepal. “Many people who are in a moment of crisis can change their minds if they do not have access to poisonous substances.”Studies show that a ban on a few highly hazardous pesticides in Bangladesh, South Korea, and Sri Lanka, among others, led to sharp reductions in overall suicide rates. Pesticides are commonly used to get rid of insects, fungi, weeds and diseases which damage plants and crops. Every year more than 1,300 metric tons of 135 types of pesticides, including insecticide, fungicide, herbicide and biopesticide, are brought into Nepal, according to the Plant Protection Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.Doctors say high levels of pesticides in fruits and vegetables cause nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dizziness and anxiety. Long-term consumption of fruits and vegetables with high levels of pesticides can lead to kidney failure, lung disease and mental health problems, and can even cause cancer. According to health experts, the consumption of such fruits and vegetables may also affect pregnant women and harm the foetus. \nNepal and China signed a Belt and Road Initiative Framework Cooperation agreement, outlining principles, objectives, and implementation mechanisms for future projects involving grant aids and project-specific financing.\nRSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, arrested for fraud and money laundering, transferred to Birgunj for further investigation along with Chhabilal Joshi, accused of embezzling funds from Birgunj cooperative.\nUS Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu met with Nepal's Deputy Prime Minister to discuss US economic assistance, MCC implementation, and USAID-supported initiatives.\nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has lodged a complaint at the National Human Rights Commission seeking its intervention in protecting the human rights of its president, Rabi Lamichhane, a two-time home minister.The fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives has been accusing the KP Sharma Oli government of misusing the state apparatus to harass and defame Lamichhane. In the complaint lodged at the constitutional human rights watchdog, the party’s acting general secretary, Kabindra Burlakoti, has accused the state machinery of engaging in media trials against his party chief and vilifying him as a criminal while he is just an accused so far.“They are providing secret documents to various media outlets to create a negative public image of Lamichhane,” the complaint reads.The party has claimed that the only intention of the abrupt transfer of its president from Chitwan to Pokhara on Thursday midnight without prior notice was to torture him. Lamichhane, who was transferred to Chitwan from Pokhara to record his statement on cooperative fraud charges, was taken back at 11 pm on Thursday without allowing him to sleep, the complaint states.The police, however, have been claiming he was transferred at night after a security assessment. Ever since he was taken to Chitwan, the party cadres had been resorting to protest against the arrest. At least a dozen people, including police personnel, were injured in the clashes on Thursday afternoon.“The police have been torturing Lamichhane on different pretexts,” reads the complaint. “His personal diary, too, has been confiscated by the police in a blatant violation of privacy rights.”Through the complaint, the party has demanded the commission’s immediate action to protect his fundamental rights. Demanding a fair investigation on the matter, the party has asked the commission “to ensure proper actions are taken against the culprits.” It has also urged the national human rights watchdog to become proactive in protecting human rights and ensuring the rule of law.The officials at the commission say they have already asked their Pokhara regional office to investigate the matter. “We are also inquiring with the Nepal Police top officials to learn whether they directed the Chitwan police to transfer Lamichhane at midnight or was the decision of the local police after analysis of the situation there,” Yagya Adhikari, a joint-secretary at the commission, told the Post. “We will investigate the matter fairly and come up with a report.”Along with the RSP, leaders from other opposition parties have also started raising questions over “never-ending” custody against Lamichhane. After meeting him in police custody in Pokhara on Saturday, Rastriya Prajatantra Party chief whip Gyan Bahadur Shahi claimed that the police had treated him inhumanely. “There is no reason to keep him in custody for so long,” Shahi said. “It is clear that the government is biased against him.”Nepal Samajbadi Party chair and former prime minister Baburam Bhattarai and Rastriya Prajatantra Party (Nepal) chief Kamal Thapa, among others, have raised similar concerns in the past. Arrested on October 18 from the RSP office in Kathmandu, Lamichhane has already spent 51 days in custody. On Sunday, the Kaski District Court granted permission to the police to hold Lamichhane in custody for four more days to continue investigating cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering allegations against him.This is the latest remand extension, following previous approvals of six, seven, ten, thirteen, and fifteen days for police to conduct inquiries.Alongside Lamichhane, the court extended the remand for former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, Leela Pachhai, and Ram Bahadur Khanal, who face similar charges.Lamichhane and Rai have been accused of misappropriating Rs142.9 million from Supreme Cooperative and diverting it to Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd. Investigations indicate Lamichhane had borrowed Rs19.6 million in personal loans from the cooperative.Further probes revealed that Gorkha Media Network’s vice chairman, Joshi, took an additional Rs24.5 million loan, which was transferred to Gorkha Media’s Global IME Bank account. Records show Supreme Cooperative’s manager, Sagar KC, authorised a loan voucher for Lamichhane, with Roshani Gurung allegedly moving funds into Gorkha Media’s account. Gurung has since been released on bail, while Cooperative chairman Om Prakash Gurung remains in custody.An investigation into Supreme Cooperative revealed that Rs780 million of members’ deposits had been diverted to other organisations. Along with cooperative frauds, Lamichhane is being investigated on organised crime and money laundering. \nThe Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) on Monday filed a corruption case against Surya Prasad Silwal, chairperson of Nepal Insurance Authority, accusing him of misusing his position, submitting false documents, and carrying out fraudulent practices.According to CIAA Spokesperson Narahari Ghimire, Silwal manipulated official documents, including citizenship and passport records, to alter his date of birth, enabling him to extend his tenure and receive undue benefits. Despite reaching the mandatory retirement age of 66 on July 31, 2023, Silwal allegedly continued in his role, misusing his position and enjoying state-sponsored privileges for an additional nine months.The investigation revealed discrepancies in Silwal's documents, citizenship and academic records and passport application. His citizenship issued by the Parsa District Administration Office on March 7, 1976 indicated he was 16 years old at the time. However, another citizenship copy from Kathmandu Administration, issued on April 30, 2009, recorded the date of his birth as November 8, 1959. Similarly, Tribhuvan University transcripts mentioned July 30, 1958 as his birthdate.Silwal falsified the date of his birth as November 9, 1961 to obtain diplomatic and special passports.CIAA argued that Silwal’s actions breach sections 15 and 16(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002 and demanded the recovery of Rs3.66 million which Silwal allegedly received in salaries and benefits since July 31, 2023. The chargesheet was filed in the Special Court, Kathmandu, on Monday.Silwal, who had retired on July 30, 2016 based on the official birthdate of July 30, 1958, reportedly altered his records to continue his service. \nProvincial assembly parliamentary committees are pivotal to strengthening federalism in Nepal. These committees work to hold provincial governments accountable. Even when the assembly is not in session, the committees can continue working. As the provincial assemblies cannot manage all the tasks, these committees, with various thematic jurisdiction and expertise, work by often rising above partisan interest to save the parliament’s time; they simplify work and conduct various studies. Article 193 of the Constitution of Nepal specifies that “the State Assembly may, as per its rules, form committees or special committees, as required, to manage its working procedures”. Thus, the number of thematic areas varies in each province. However, the functioning of these committees is undermined in several provinces. In Karnali, three of the four parliamentary committees—the Finance and Natural Resources Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Social Development Committee—are currently without heads. While the first committee has had no chief since April this year, the latter two have been vacant for three months. The prolonged leadership vacuum in important committees is also something that is routinely seen in other provinces. The five committees in Bagmati were at a standstill without chairpersons for more than a year since the first session of the start of the second term of the Bagmati Provincial Assembly in January 2023. The parliamentary committees in Lumbini and Sudurpaschim have been without their chairs after the formation of their respective assemblies last year. The absence of chiefs of these key provincial assembly parliamentary committees makes it difficult to hold the provincial governments accountable. These governments fail on governance, budget implementation and role assignment to the provincial assemblies. Passage of essential bills is also hampered. Four critical bills are stuck in various committees in Karnali. Meetings to facilitate dialogue between assembly members and ministers are yet to be convened. Moreover, the provincial government, taking advantage of the committee’s ineffectiveness and lack of monitoring, has been working arbitrarily, bypassing essential checks and balances.This in turn has added to the woes of Karnali, a geographically remote and severely underdeveloped region in western Nepal. The inactivity of the Social Development Committee is particularly concerning in a province where basic social indicators, such as health and literacy, lag far behind the national average. As the committee also deals with ministries of land management, agriculture and cooperatives, labour and social justice and human rights commission, works related to these areas are also affected. Despite the province’s rich natural resources, their potential remains untapped. Lack of development activities, particularly road-related infrastructure, has affected the province’s tourism prospects. The inactivity of the Finance and Natural Resources Committee is, therefore, troubling. More worryingly, another leaderless committee—Public Accounts—which oversees the financial discipline of the province, could fail to monitor corruption activities.Provincial governments were envisioned as significant drivers of localised development and accountability, but they have often become battlegrounds for political manoeuvring. Because of this, appointments for the leadership positions in these committees, as has happened in Bagmati in the past, have been deliberately delayed by the political parties. Even though Karnali’s assembly regulations allow the eldest member of the assembly committee to act as an interim chief, this provision has not been invoked. The political parties would do well to appoint the chairs immediately to stop the erosion of public trust in provincial governments—unless that is precisely their intent.    \nThe recent ‘framework agreement for BRI cooperation’ could be the perfect impetus for Nepal and China to kickstart the stalled BRI projects. Notably, the deal has the backing of both of Nepal’s major political forces, which together constitute nearly two-third parliamentary majority. China’s strained relations with the Nepali Congress, the country’s biggest political party, has been a hurdle to closer bilateral ties. While Beijing sees the Congress doing the bidding of Washington and New Delhi, the Congress feels China, going beyond the bounds of diplomacy, wants to cultivate exclusive ties with Nepal’s communist parties. The framework agreement could help change such unhelpful mutual suspicions. It was signed with the consent of the Congress. Beijing will take note. Some may argue that there is still disgruntlement in the Congress over the agreement. But then, was the entire party on board even when the Congress leadership took the monumental decision to form a government under KP Sharma Oli’s leadership?The other day, I bumped into a senior leader from the ‘rival’ Congress camp. As we both sipped masala tea while soaking in the winter sun, I started picking his brain. “The Congress is divided over the new BRI agreement, isn't it?” I asked. “These are useless murmurs of discontent inside the party,” he replied without missing a beat. “As the party functions today, if daju-bhauju want something, they get it.”Just like the CPN-UML is a one-man Oli show these days, the Congress too is firmly under the control of the Deubas—Sher Bahadur and Arzu Rana. It was the couple who dragged the party willy-nilly into the government, and they also had the final say from the Congress on the BRI deal. “If it’s fait accompli, why are some Kanresis still making hue and cry about the deal?” I pressed the Congress leader.“I will tell you in one word: India.” The southern neighbour is not happy with Nepal’s participation in the BRI. The initiative, with the China Pakistan Economic Corridor as its centerpiece, is seen as inimical to Indian interests. Kathmandu’s participation in it also threatens to yank Nepal out of India’s orbit.A Nepal-based Indian diplomat chose to put it thus: “Look how the MCC deal progressed in Nepal. The relevant document was in public domain and the compact was vigorously debated in your parliament. Shouldn’t the same metric apply to the Belt and Road Initiative? You guys haven’t even seen any of the vital BRI documents!”As the Congress leader suggested, if there are no new irritants in Congress-UML relations, the disagreement within the Congress over the new BRI deal could soon blow over. It should. The Deubas may have backed the framework for their personal goals. More importantly, it is also in Nepal’s interest. If India’s repeated blockades have taught us something, it is not to rely too heavily on our southern neighbour. This, among other things, means reaching out to Beijing to build vital connectivity projects and develop new economic links. But Nepal cannot lean too far towards China as well: We are two different societies with vastly different political cultures. This is why we must strike a careful balance between the two neighbours—and with the new sky neighbour in the United States. But this again will be impossible if the Congress and the UML continue to wield Nepal’s foreign policy as a domestic political bludgeon. Traditionally, the Nepali communists have cottoned to China. On the other hand, the Nepali Congress has been a staunch backer of close ties with India. These party-wise leanings have done great harm to Nepal. For this reason, the need for a consensus based foreign policy has long been felt. The country’s two biggest parties often (and naturally) found themselves in opposite benches in parliament and fought tooth and nail on foreign policy, particularly over India and China. The debates around the American MCC compact were rather acrimonious too. Now, by sheer luck, the Congress and the UML are together in the government. This presents a rare opportunity to build broad consensus on foreign policy. Oli has gone to China and stitched together an important deal. Perhaps he can do the same with India and with Nepal’s other important international friends—again with the support of the Congress. In this way, this ‘coalition of convenience’ for Oli and Deuba could herald an era of a more coordinated foreign policy approach. The new China deal has already given an encouraging message that Nepali political parties are capable of acting together on vital foreign policy issues.Some may reckon many aspects of the BRI are still vague and as such Nepal should be cautious. True. Yet the current agreement also gives Nepal enough wiggle room to back out of unwanted proposals from Beijing. The ‘aid financing modalities’ can include both soft loans and grants. Based on the deal, it would be impossible for Beijing to insist that Nepal accept high-interest Chinese loans. This possibility will be further mitigated if negotiations take place on a case-by-case basis. Principally, Nepal cannot refuse any and all kinds of loans from China—as some in the Congress argue it should—while it eagerly laps up such loans from the rest of the world. In any case, under three percent of the foreign loans Nepal has taken comes from China—less than what Japan or India have lent it. By contrast, the World Bank and the ADB contribute over 80 percent of Nepal’s loans. As the BRI is the centrepiece of China’s foreign engagement under President Xi Jinping, Nepal cannot reject the initiative and still maintain healthy relations with Beijing. If we can agree on the right projects, there is no harm in taking some soft loans under the BRI. Again, going beyond the BRI, the Congress and the UML should take the lead in preparing a common white paper on foreign policy—while they are still a part of the ruling coalition. History suggests this will be difficult to do when the parties are in opposition camps.  \nBritish philosopher Bertrand Russell in his famous essay about the idea of a university says that a university is, first and foremost, a place. He stresses that a university—though it is a concept, an idea, a poetics of space and a metaphor of culture and life—is, in the final analysis, a place. We should be clear about that. This famous essay in the English textbook, The English We Use, was discussed with Bachelor level students at Tribhuvan University. It represents Russell's concept of space as a sanctuary of a university. The period when we taught this essay was marked by a certain shift in educational innovations and what the university claimed “a quest for a new educational system”. It happened sometime in the early 1970s. The experiment was called the New Education System Plan introduced by Tribhuvan University. The plan, among other things, tried to shuffle or deconstruct the concept of “university” as a place and introduce an idea that used new technologies in education to diffuse certain fixed notions about it and invent ways to make educational experiments. I want to cite from a keynote address that I delivered at the 34th Annual Conference of the Linguistic Society of Nepal on November 26, 2013. “When the New Education System Plan used computer for screening applications for admission in colleges the news spread like Australian bush fire. I remember one senior citizen who turned up at a working centre located in Padmakanya campus seeking admission of his daughter-in-law at the proficiency certificate level some time in 1972, asking … ‘Sir, I want to meet computer sir because they say he has taken the entire responsibility of admitting or rejecting students’ bharnaa’”. As a young teacher at the university, I was also assigned to work as a member of that team meeting on the campus. Professor Shiva Gopal Risal had tried to seek to sort out the senior man’s question respectfully. Did the computer come as a toy to confound people, create wonder and deprive them of educational opportunities, or promote true education? No responsible agency addressed that question.A straight answer is that Tribhuvan University, the sole higher educational institution in the country, was seeking to pluralise the concept of place as a university. It wanted to do so by challenging the concept of a fixed space and substituting in its place the idea of education as a concept that could be shared across the campuses. But that concept did bring problems with it. It came as a double whammy—educational spaces lost their unique identities and failed to use the new syllabuses and technologies that were few and far between. That varied according to the nature of the institutions. However, the idea of using new technologies to teach humanities and social sciences did not work. The following period saw the emergence of several universities and higher educational institutions. Spaces multiplied. Opportunities came to open plural centres and locations to impart higher education understood under different geographical and cultural rubrics. One can easily guess that the period had brought some euphoric moments. People who took up the cudgel to start new institutional centres under this euphoria were doing admirable work. But things do not appear to have worked to fulfil the good dreams of the good people. Tribhuvan University continued to grow larger and attract more students. I am dismayed by the smaller number of students at other higher educational institutions or universities in Nepal. Sudip Kaini of Kantipur presents some important figures in his survey of students’ enrollment. The students enrolling for university education appear to go mostly to TU (more than 77 percent). Of the 16 universities, hardly one percent get admitted to 10 universities. According to one University Grants Commission report, out of more than 0.6 million students, almost 0.5 million go to TU. In terms of percentage, the rate of admission in Pokhara University is 5.56, Kathmandu University is 3.33, Far Western University is 3.06, Mid Western University is 1.61, University of Forest and Agriculture is 0.64, Nepal Sanskrit University is 0.52 and Lumbini Baudha University is 0.29. All these universities were established over a decade ago. The figures speak volumes. The onus of higher education lies on the largest and the oldest TU.Reports about the land grabbing of Tribhuvan University's central location are emerging. Reportedly, out of the 3,613 ropanis of the University's land, 900 ropanis are occupied by 19 outer organisations. (Naya Patrika, June 29, 2022). That is a stunning report. The figures and reports are easily available now. Other universities in the country have their own narratives about their lands. The land story shows the centrality of the TU in terms of its size, location and spread. It has become more crucial to address the question of land because of the needs of universities other than TU. Universities tell their stories about acquiring spaces, with the theme of politics and power, which have become an essential subject of discussion today. For instance, Kathmandu University acquired spaces inside Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur metropolis and outside to open its various institutions and departments; it is unique in many ways.We return to the mega story of TU trying to track its land, which people and institutions grabbed over a long period. Evoking Russell's idea of a university as a place, we can say that TU, far from finding its spaces and cogently using them to create sanctuaries, is fighting on two fronts—restoring ownership of its land and using that for academic purposes by making the institution stronger and more important. To take an eloquent example, the euphoric activities of good sports and the noise and crowd generated by it indicate the centrality and importance of TU's space in Kirtipur. It is natural for a university that gives higher education to the 77 percent of the students of this land, irrespective of the fact that there are other functioning universities, to find its space, its land, and to seek to function with dignity and a system. The whole thing is related to the question of space, prestige and the creation of a permanent operation system. I believe now is the right time to work on all these fronts. I want to repeat a popular Nepali expression—sabailai chetana bhaya.  \nIt is no secret that Nepal is teetering on the scale of economic fragility. Even though the government has introduced some progressive policies and economic benchmarks, the country still struggles to stabilise its economy. This is partly due to an excessive reliance on remittances and policies favouring their growth. Remittances may appear beneficial but can lead to instability in various other sectors. Such a phenomenon is known as the Dutch disease effect. In the 1960s, the Dutch economy grew as they discovered large swathes of oil deposits in the Northern Sea. An oil boom of this calibre can speed up the economic growth of any nation. However, such shallow development led to inflation, eventually sickening their economy. Subsequently, non-petroleum commodities became less competitive and more expensive. In other words, overly depending on a single export source led to the erosion of the value of other commodities. Nepal isn’t known for having oil reserves and deposits like that of the Netherlands. However, several experts and policymakers have highlighted that the burgeoning inflow of remittances can cause a series of Dutch disease-like impacts akin to that of commodity booms. Since the disease affects any economy that is heavily reliant on foreign currency, foreign assistance and foreign direct investments, Nepal, in particular, becomes vulnerable. As the gap in the remittance-to-nation ratio continues to widen, the national currency value is likely to diminish. The latest report from Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) states that Nepal’s remittance for the fiscal year 2023-24 totalled Rs1,445.32 billion, a 15 percent increase compared to the previous fiscal year. In contrast, the data on remittance in 2016 was Rs679 billion, which is less than half the remittance as of this year. Such a level of dependency can exacerbate inflation, drive up consumption prices and intensify the real estate bubbles. When the value of properties becomes far more than its worth, it creates a mass trickle-down effect that continues to pour over other productive sectors. The symptoms of Dutch disease continue to strain the Nepali economy for two main reasons. First, there is a significant exodus of labour migrants. Many Nepalis flock to foreign countries, either temporarily or permanently. This is encouraged by the government as well as political leaders. Second, Nepali consumers often have a preference for imported commodities. As the country becomes less independent, it relies far more than necessary on imports. Several macroeconomic reports indicate a negative trade-off for Nepal in its exports of labour migrants and skilled manpower, with many opting to reside abroad in search of a better life. No amount of Riyals, Ringgits, or Dirhams can compensate for the loss of a long-term sustainable development. Production doesn’t become feasible for the general populace, leading to overreliance on imports. In a nation where the balance of payments is consistently stretching towards the negative bottom, the lack of adequate labour force participation has become a hindrance in productive sectors. NRB’s empirical analysis suggests that further reliance on remittance at an increasing level can widen the trade deficits, both in the short and the long run. As consumer demand increases, the supply side can barely keep up, creating inflationary pressures and increasing prices.Further, a nation that prides itself on its so-called vision of independence is now at the mercy of remittances. A shift in policies or geopolitical instability, rising tensions within the Gulf nations, and the spread of the Israel-Palestine conflict to other nations can dramatically affect the prospects of labour migrants sending their hard-earned money home. There is no denying that remittance has played a significant role in Nepal’s economy. It has contributed considerably to economic growth and increased foreign exchange reserves. However, the concerned authorities shouldn’t forget that excess reliance on one economic sector can lead to a perpetual decline in other sectors. Given the threat of excess dependency on remittance, Nepal must diversify its economic portfolio. Concomitantly, with the help of effective plans and policies, the exodus of foreign labour migrants must be mitigated. Opportunities should be created and provided in the home country. Financial institutions that draft impactful policies must adhere to congenial policies. The need for macroprudential policies, whose primary goal is to maintain financial stability and limit fiscal vulnerabilities, becomes more crucial to minimise the possibility of carrying the symptoms of the Dutch disease. Only by acting prudently can Nepal safeguard its economy. \nNepal has been placed in a challenging Group F for the AFC Asian Cup 2027 Qualifiers following the draw held at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. Nepal will compete against Vietnam, Malaysia, and Laos, in what is expected to be a demanding group stage.Each team in the group will play home-and-away matches, starting on March 25, when Nepal faces Malaysia. Nepal will then play Malaysia again on November 18, Laos on June 10 and March 31 next year, and Vietnam on October 9 and 14.The qualifiers feature 24 teams divided into six groups, with the group winners securing a place in the AFC Asian Cup 2027 to be held in Saudi Arabia.Group A comprises Tajikistan, the Philippines, the Maldives, and Timor-Leste, while Group B includes Lebanon, Yemen, Bhutan, and Brunei. Group C features India, Hong Kong, and Bangladesh. Group D has Thailand, Turkmenistan, Chinese Taipei, and Sri Lanka, and Group E comprises Syria, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Pakistan. \nPolice arrested eight people on charge of gang-raping a 14-year-old girl in Bardiya. Three other accused are on the run.According to Rupesh Shah, Inspector at the Area Police Office in Motipur, the suspects were detained after the victim lodged a complaint against them. The Bardiya district court on Monday remanded the suspects in custody for five days for investigation. The victim claimed that the suspects repeatedly raped her three months ago. Investigation is underway into the case, said police.  \nIndia has appointed current revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra as the new Reserve Bank of India governor, a notification from the government’s cabinet appointments committee on Monday showed.Malhotra, who has previously also held the post of secretary in India’s financial services department, will take over from Shaktikanta Das whose six-year term concludes on Tuesday.The Indian Administrative Service Officer, who over the last three decades has worked across sectors including power, finance, taxation, information technology and mines, has been appointed for a three-year term.Das took over as central bank chief in 2018, after previous governor Urjit Patel resigned before the end of his term following a difficult relationship with the government.Das had helped stabilise relations with the government while also overseeing a period of recovery in India’s financial sector and most recently led an effort to prevent a build-up of risk, asking lenders to avoid all “forms of exuberance.”The central bank, under Das, has also been seen as more interventionist in financial markets, stamping out volatility in the exchange rate to decadal lows. \nIsrael will step up airstrikes on Syrian stores of advanced weaponry, Israeli officials said on Monday, and keep a ‘limited’ troop presence on the ground, hoping to head off any threat that could emerge in the fallout of president Bashar al-Assad’s overthrow.Israel has watched the upheaval in Syria with a mixture of hope and concern as it weighs the consequences of one of the most significant strategic shifts in the Middle East in years.While Assad's fall wiped out a bastion from which Israel’s arch-foe Iran had exercised influence in the region, the lightning advance of a disparate group of rebel forces with roots in the Islamist ideology of Al Qaeda poses risks.Defence Minister Israel Katz said the military would “destroy heavy strategic weapons throughout Syria, including surface-to-air missiles, air defence systems, surface-to-surface missiles, cruise missiles, long-range rockets, and coastal missiles.”A senior Israeli official said airstrikes would persist in the coming days, while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel had no interest in interfering in internal Syrian affairs and was concerned only with defending its citizens.“That’s why we attack strategic weapons systems like, for example, remaining chemical weapons or long-range missiles and rockets in order that they will not fall into the hands of extremists,” Saar told reporters in Jerusalem.Still reeling from the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ attack in October 2023, Israel is also looking to head off any future threat from its neighbour.Israeli forces had already cleared landmines and established new barriers on the frontier between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and a demilitarised strip bordering Syria in October.Early on Sunday, the military said it had sent ground forces into the demilitarised zone, a 400-sq-km (155-sq-mile) buffer created by a 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement and overseen by the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF).The military on Monday published photos of Israeli commandos in the Syrian Mount Hermon area.Saar said the troop presence was strictly limited. “It’s basically near our borders, sometimes a few hundred metres, sometimes one mile or two miles,” he said. “It is a very limited and temporary step we took for security reasons.” \nTaiwan raised its alert level on Monday saying China has set up seven zones of reserved airspace and deployed naval fleets and coast guard boats in what a security source described as the first military drills across a broad swathe of the region's waters.A senior Taiwan security official told Reuters that China currently has nearly 90 navy and coast guard ships in waters near Taiwan, the southern Japanese islands and the East and South China Seas, of which around two-thirds were navy vessels.Beijing’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, had been expected to launch another round of exercises in response to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te’s trip to the Pacific, which included stopovers in Hawaii and the US territory of Guam, security sources had told Reuters.China has set up seven “temporary reserved areas” of airspace to the east of its eastern Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, Taiwan’s defence ministry said in a statement, adding those zones are valid from Monday to Wednesday.Such zones are temporarily reserved and allocated for a particular user during a set period, though other flights can pass through with permission from controllers, according to international rules.In Washington, the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Taiwan security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the scale of China’s navy and coast guard deployment was larger than the previous two major drills around Taiwan this year, which were dubbed “Joint Sword 2024-A” and “Joint Sword 2024-B”.“For the first time they are targeting the entire island chain,” the source said, referring to an area that runs from Japan through Taiwan, the Philippines and onto Borneo, enclosing China’s coastal seas.\"They are meant to achieve total military intimidation by positioning to control the inner part of the island chain.\"Taiwan’s military said it has activated its “combat readiness exercises” at strategic locations and its naval and coast guard boats are closely monitoring Chinese military activities.“Any unilateral and irrational, provocative actions could seriously damage peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and that will not be welcomed by the international community,” Taiwan’s defence ministry said.‘Grey Zone Harassment’The reason behind China's reserved airspace zones was still unclear, said Wang Ting-yu, a senior lawmaker for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party.\"They are likely to run military activities, or it's only just a false alarm meant to exert political pressures,\" said Wang, who leads the parliament's defence and foreign affairs committee.“Please be a civilized neighbouring country. Don't be a troublemaker all the time.”Taiwan's coast guard, in a separate statement, said that seven Chinese coast guard ships have been carrying out “grey-zone harassment” against the island since earlier in the day.China does not have the right to carry out any intrusion or law enforcement actions in Taiwan’s waters, and Taipei has the right to take necessary measures in response, the coast guard said.Taipei says China has been using “grey-zone” tactics that stop short of actual combat to test and pressure Taiwanese forces, including daily air force and navy missions around the island and regular coast guard patrols.Beijing detests Lai as a “separatist” and has rebuffed his repeated calls for talks. Lai and his government reject Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying only Taiwan’s people can decide their future.China’s sabre rattling around Taiwan, as well as in the disputed South China Sea, has raised fears of possible conflict.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking to US sailors at the Yokosuka naval base in Japan on Monday, said China is the only country in the world that has the intent and increasingly the capability to change the rules-based international order.“And so we want to see this region, this area remain open to freedom of navigation and the ability to fly the skies and international airways whenever we want to,” he added. \nAt least 40 schools received a bomb threat by email in Delhi on Monday demanding $30,000, ANI news agency said, while police officials conducted initial searches on school premises.Schools, railway stations and airports this year have been subject to hundreds of bomb threats, which have later turned out to be hoaxes.Airlines and airports in India received 999 hoax bomb threats from the start of the year until mid-November, and 12 people had been arrested during the same period, government data shows.Two schools got the threatening email on Sunday night, which said multiple bombs were planted inside buildings and would be detonated if the sender was not paid $30,000, according to ANI.Many other schools received the emails on Monday morning, prompting school authorities to call parents to take the students home for the day.Parents were seen picking their children up from the gates of some schools as police checked school premises for suspicious items.Police officials in Delhi did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.In May, more than 50 schools in Delhi and the adjoining suburb of Noida received similar bomb threat emails that turned out to be hoaxes. \nThe Embassy of India in Nepal, in collaboration with the Lumbini Development Trust and Lumbini Buddhist University, organised the second edition of the India-Nepal Cultural Festival in Lumbini on Sunday.The festival celebrated the rich cultural heritage and traditions of both India and Nepal, with a special focus on Buddhism, read a press note issued by the Indian Embassy.The event was jointly inaugurated by Governor of Lumbini Province Krishna Bahadur Gharti Magar; Prachanda Bikram Neupane, minister for Industry, Tourism & Transport Management of Lumbini Province; Janmajay Timilsina, minister for Social Development of Lumbini Province; Lharkyal Lama, vice chairman of Lumbini Development Trust; and Prasanna Shrivastava, deputy chief of mission at the Embassy of India in Kathmandu. In the evening a cultural programme was held, highlighting a Kathak dance recital, themed around Buddhism, performed by an eight-member troupe from India led by Shikha Sharma and traditional Nepali dance performances by Swojan Raghubanshi and his group, said the embassy.Additionally, an academic seminar titled “Buddhist Cultural Heritage of India and Nepal” was organised at Lumbini Buddhist University. The seminar brought together eminent Buddhist scholars from India and Nepal, who shared their valuable insights on the cultural and historical significance of Buddhist heritage in both countries.This interaction aimed at promoting and strengthening the age-old cultural heritage, and close ties between India and Nepal with a deeper appreciation for Indian art forms among the young students of the school, the release stated. \nJust weeks after her groundbreaking Nobel Prize win, Han Kang’s books have sold millions of copies nationwide.Last week, annual sales reports from major Korean bookstores revealed that half of the year’s top-10 bestsellers were Han's works.Particularly noteworthy is that among her titles, “Human Acts” holds the No. 1 spot on both Kyobo Book Center, the country’s largest bookstore chain, and Yes24, the leading online retailer. With the global acclaim of “The Vegetarian,” which won the International Booker Prize in 2016, and the recent praise for her latest release, “We Do Not Part,” it is “Human Acts” that has resonated most profoundly with Korean readers.Coincidentally, the current political situation in Korea, sparked by President Yoon Seok Yeol’s proclamation of martial law on Tuesday evening, has drawn comparisons to the historical context depicted in “Human Acts.”The novel draws from the May 18 Gwangju Democratic Uprising of 1980, a brutal massacre by the South Korean military that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of students and unarmed civilians.The country’s previous martial law was declared on October 27, 1979, by then-Interim President Choi Kyu-hah, following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee. The 440 days of martial law saw numerous pro-democracy movements and the December 12, 1979, military coup that brought former President Chun Doo-hwan to power. Chun extended martial law nationwide at midnight, on May 18, and the Gwangju Democratic Uprising erupted as citizens protested Chun’s martial regime.Readers have filled online reviews with reflections linking the book to contemporary events.“I never wanted the events of this book to repeat, but now, after Tuesday, martial law has taken on a chilling relevance. Thankfully, it was lifted quickly, but democracy demands constant vigilance,” one comment reads.Another comment says, “Today (Tuesday) must not be forgotten. We saw how history can repeat itself if we let these stories fade. Please, don’t forget.”Han, who was born in Gwangju and lived there until just months before the uprising, acknowledged the parallels during a press conference in Stockholm on Friday.“Like everyone else that night, I was deeply shocked,” she said. “To write ‘Human Acts,’ I spent a lot of time studying the martial law events that happened back in 1979. For me to witness a similar situation unfold in real time in 2024 was startling. One difference between the situation in 1979 and the winter of 2024 is that this time it was broadcast live for everyone to witness.”Han also spoke about how the city holds special meaning for her as her hometown and its significance as the backdrop for the novel.“It is my wish that violence or coercion will not take place to suppress the press. We should not go back to the past where the press was oppressed by the government,” she continued.She underscored the critical role of literature in confronting violence and fostering resilience.“Language cannot be coerced. It cannot be stopped so no matter what happens in the future, the truth will continue to be told. The power of language cannot be stopped.”-In Association with ANN \nToday the weather is forecast to be generally to mostly cloudy in Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and partly to generally cloudy in the rest of the country.Light to moderate rain is likely to occur at some places of Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and light rain at a few areas of hilly regions of the rest of the country.

This reflects our dedication to providing efficient, personalised, and time-saving services, especially for professionals and businesses managing packed schedules,” said Subedi. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nThree years after Sher Bahadur Deuba got re-elected to the party president of Nepali Congress, the issue of who is the party’s second in hierarchy after Deuba is yet to be resolved.It re-emerged as a serious issue in the party’s provincial conference on Saturday.The Nepali Congress organised the party’s Koshi provincial conference in Biratnagar, the first of its kind convened after the party adapted to the provincial structure. Some key leaders opted out though. Among those were Shekhar Koirala, who leads the party’s anti-establishment faction, and party general secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma.The boycott of Koirala and other leaders has triggered an intra-party debate. At the provincial level, the conference is considered the second most important event in the party’s organisational affairs after provincial convention, which elects provincial leadership.Party president Deuba, Senior Vice President Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, former general secretary duo Shashank Koirala and Krishna Prasad Sitaula including other second-rung leaders of the party took part in the conference. Koshi’s former chief minister Kedar Karki, who is close to Shekhar Koirala, gave two reasons why Koirala didn’t participate. The party had not consulted Koirala on the provincial conference and he got the invitation late, said Karki, “which is why Koirala instead took part in a pre-set function in Chitwan”. Contrary to Karki’s claim, other leaders close to Koirala said that the top leader skipped the conference for other reasons. “As Koirala’s supporters, we had asked the top party leadership to ensure Koirala’s hierarchy would be just below party president at the conference. But our demand was ignored,” a leader close to Shekhar Koirala told the Post. “This is why he skipped the meet.”Shekhar Koirala and his faction have been demanding that he be given the second position after the president in the party hierarchy. In Congress, the leader who is runner-up in the race for the party’s presidential election is usually given second position. Koirala is yet to be given that position. He was the closest contender for the post of president at the 14th general convention, when Deuba retained the party’s top post.Senior journalist Purushottam Dahal, who is close to Congress, said it is not mandatory for a leader in the Congress to be given the title of senior leader with second position in the hierarchy.“But that would also not be something abnormal,” Dahal added.Earlier, Ramchandra Paudel, who lost to Deuba in the race for party presidency in 2016, was given the second position and designated as senior leader. Shekhar Koirala is now asking for the same.At present, Purna Bahadur Khadka who is the party’s senior vice-president, is in the second position after party chief Deuba. Khadka was elected as vice-president at the party’s last general convention.Koirala, who opted out of the Saturday’s provincial gathering, however, had organised a separate meeting of his faction, which was attended by municipal-level chairmen in Biratnagar on December 3 by defying the party central committee’s circular.Leaders Shekhar Koirala, Sunil Sharma, Dig Bahadur Limbu, Minendra Rijal, and Gururaj Ghimire, among others, attended the closed session.Ghimire, a Congress leader from Koirala-led camp, said that Koirala did not participate in Saturday's conference “due to the incompetence of the party president and the provincial president”. Ghimire said that although Koirala was placed second in party hierarchy in the two provincial conferences organised earlier, he was not given that hierarchy in the Koshi provincial gathering—even though the event was being organised in his own constituency.Before Koshi province, the Congress held such provincial conferences in Lumbini and Gandaki. In both gatherings, Koirala was invited in the capacity as party leader after the president, said Ghimire. Koirala also had attended both the conferences. While Koirala reached Chitwan citing his engagement in an pre-arranged event, General Secretary Sharma went to Solukhumbu for a Khumbu trek. According to the secretariat of Sharma, Khubmu trek had been scheduled earlier. But it had to be postponed after Sharma was appointed the party’s commander for the December 1 bypolls. “It is the failure of the party president and provincial president to not be able to accommodate two influential party leaders in the provincial conference,” Ghimire said. In Koshi, Uddhav Thapa, who is close to Krishna Prasad Sitaula, is the provincial chief. Sitaula himself is now considered close to party president Deuba.“It would be easier for us if the party statute itself clearly defined the role and hierarchy of senior party leaders,” Thapa said. General Secretary Gagan Thapa said that everyone needs space and respect while addressing the conference.General Secretary Thapa, who participated in the conference organised in Koirala’s hometown Biratnagar, emphasised that leaders should put aside ‘technical issues’ and prioritise party unity. “Unity in the party is essential, and necessary to bring everyone together,” said General Secretary Thapa. “It is not enough to talk about technical unity, it is a political matter that needs to be resolved politically… everyone should be accommodated.” But Thapa, who was earlier with Koirala and jointly led the ‘Koirala-Thapa camp’, lambasted the factional gathering organised by Koirala in Biratnagar. Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa formed a panel and contested for the posts of party president and general secretary, respectively, in the last general convention. While Deuba defeated Koirala, Thapa got elected as a general secretary.Now, Deuba is out of the race as the party statute puts a two-term limit on party chief, while both Koirala and Thapa are aspirants for the top position. Of late, Thapa has been inching closer to Deuba while Koirala has been hardening his position against Deuba and his Saturday’s posture could be part of the same strategy, observers said.The 14th general convention of the Nepali Congress was held in December 2021. The party charter gives each elected body a tenure of four years. But if the general convention cannot be held within four years, the charter provides for a year’s extension.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has yet again postponed the general convention of its student wing All Nepal National Independent Students’ Union (Revolutionary).An office-bearers’ meeting of the party on Thursday decided to defer the 23rd general convention, which was slated to commence in the Capital on Sunday. After several postponements, the national jamboree of the union started in September. However, it was suspended without electing the leadership following a dispute over the selection of convention representatives and whether or not set up an age bar for the leadership.With no sign for the resumption of the convention, a team of party’s student leaders, led by vice-chair Keshab Rawal, staged a hunger strike demanding the national gathering be held in December second week and leadership elected through a vote. They withdrew their strike with the party leadership agreeing to hold the convention starting on December 8. However, the party meeting led by chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal decided to defer the convention citing lack of preparations due to the need for the party to focus on local by-polls.The next Standing Committee meeting called for December 12 will take a decision regarding its student wing’s convention, according to party leaders.The student leaders, however, seem unconvinced. Rawal, who also is a contender for the union’s presidency, accused the party leadership of treating students as their slaves, who must obey them without question.“This is not just interference in student affairs, it shows they see us as slaves,” Rawal told the Post. “This is unacceptable. I don’t believe the party’s next meeting will announce the date. I will stage a protest again.” Though the party has cited lack of preparation for the postponement, insiders suggest that Dahal is worried because his chosen candidate may not win the elections. “The second rung leaders do not agree with Dahal’s selection. Dahal is avoiding election because he fears his candidate might lose,” said a party leader. Around a dozen student leaders backed by different factions within the party are in the race for the union’s presidency. Party’s senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha supports Pawan Karki. Karki had been running a parallel organisation within the union after Dahal picked Pancha Singh as chair two years back. Barshaman Pun is pushing for Dipesh Pun or Tukman Mahara and Janardan Sharma wants Madan Bhul or Narayan Khanal. Both the leaders are deputy general secretaries in the Maoist Centre.Naresh Regmi has the backing of Pampha Bhusal and Dev Gurung, the party’s vice-chair and general secretary, respectively. Although Dahal hasn’t openly endorsed any candidate, he reportedly has a soft corner for Regmi. By supporting Regmi ahead, Dahal wants to please Bhusal and Gurung to garner their support to induct Netra Bikram Chand, who had earlier splintered from the Maoist Centre, in the party. But deputy general secretaries Pun and Sharma reportedly do not want Chand in the party.The deputy general secretaries, though they are rivals, have started coming together when it comes to challenging Dahal’s leadership. “They feel that Dahal is imposing his decision by dividing them. It is clear that Pun and Sharma will not accept Dahal’s candidate for the union’s chairperson. They might even field a common candidate to counter Dahal’s candidate if voting takes place,” said the leader. “Defeat of Dahal’s candidate would mean he is losing grip on the party organisation.”Some of the student leaders, however, believe the December 12 meeting would take a decision regarding the convention. “I believe the party will either decide to hold voting or will handpick the leadership,” said Regmi.For years, the Maoist Centre’s leadership has directly selected the leadership of its student union. As many as 2,323 representatives were handpicked for the national gathering in September.However, a section of the leaders raised questions over the legality of around 70 representatives, most of whom are enrolled to various institutions under the Council for Vocational Education and Training. The dissident group argues that these representatives were handpicked without following the proper selection process.The differences escalated to the extent where representatives smashed the furniture at the Kirtipur venue of the convention twice as they clashed. A group of student leaders, taking cue from Mahara, the son of Jokh Bahadur Mahara, former Lumbini chief minister, even brandished a khukuri (Gurkha knife). A large number of police personnel were deployed at the Tribhuvan University campus to contain the protest.Right from the commencement of the conference, there were strong calls to impose an age limit for student leaders. But not everyone agreed to that. Without consensus, the issue was to be decided through voting. However, the voting didn’t take place due to the lack of agreement over the representatives leading to the convention’s postponement. \nThe dispute between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Janamat Party has escalated as they engage in public accusations against each other through statements.For months, the party has been trying to remove its lawmaker Goma Labh Sapkota from the position claiming she was involved in an irregularity. The Madhesh-based party has been writing to the parliament secretariat and Speaker Devraj Ghimire urging them to remove Sapkota as a member of the lower house.In November first week, the party wrote to Ghimire for the third time claiming she needs to be sacked as a lawmaker alleging that she had received bribes from a contractor and was also conspiring to split the party. Ghimire on November 21 turned down the request arguing the charges the party has leveled against Sapkota don’t lead to her disqualification for the lawmaker post.He said the Political Parties Act has prescribed the conditions when a lawmaker loses his/her position, but the allegations against her don't fall under the conditions.Angered with the decision, the CK Raut-led party not only accused Ghimire of engaging in “criminal conduct” but also claimed that his decision was racist and reeked of bigotry. Issuing a press statement on Monday, it said the decision to continue Sapkota’s position was discriminatory and against the parliamentary norms.“By invalidating the party's disciplinary action, the Parliament Secretariat not only violated the party’s supremacy but also, by acting as a partisan of a particular party, went beyond its jurisdiction, engaging in unlawful, unconstitutional, and criminal acts that jeopardise the multi-party parliamentary system and democracy itself,” the Janamat Party’s statement reads. “If the Speaker is allowed to act beyond his jurisdiction with such arbitrary power, it will set a dangerous precedent and pose a significant threat to democracy.”The party also accused Ghimire of not taking action against Sapkota because she is his relative and had committed to joining the CPN-UML (after splitting the party). Ghimire was elected as the Speaker from the UML.Just because someone is a relative of the Speaker or has pledged to join the Speaker’s former party, he cannot defend a lawmaker even though the party’s central committee has taken action against her following all due legal process, the statement further reads.Further alleging Ghimire, the party claimed that the Speaker has been demonstrating extreme racist and discriminatory behavior in the past, especially regarding issues like the use of language and attire in Parliament, in allocating time and in other parliamentary proceedings.A day later, on Tuesday, the parliament secretariat issued a statement taking a serious exception to the party’s allegation against the Speaker. Through the statement, Anant Prasad Koirala, assistant spokesperson at the secretariat, rubbished the allegations claiming that there has been no discrimination on the grounds of caste, ethnicity, colour, gender, community, language, religion, or physical condition.He said the party requested for Sapkota dismissal as a lawmaker citing in accordance with the Section 35(2) of the Political Parties Act but the allegations aren’t in line with the prescribed conditions for the lawmaker’s dismissal.“The federal parliament secretariat, upon receiving the letter, presented the matter in accordance with the provisions of Nepal’s Constitution and relevant laws (the House of Representatives Rules, 2079 and the Political Parties Act, 2073), and the Speaker has made a decision in accordance with the law,” the Secretariat’s statement said. “The secretariat wants to inform that all the details of the Speaker’s decision are clear and, as always, will ensure that all actions are carried out in accordance with the law.”Sapkota has been refuting the allegations of corruption and conspiring against the party. She has claimed that she is being targetted because she didn’t appoint her personal assistant as dictated by her party leadership. \nOn December 1, when by-elections were underway for 41 vacant local level positions across 32 districts in seven provinces, Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) President Rajendra Lingden claimed that his party could win big in the next general elections, citing growing public disenchantment with the big political parties.Speaking at the inauguration of the party’s municipal convention in Birtamod, Jhapa President Lingden said, “There is no alternative to the RPP in Nepal, and the party should move forward accordingly.” However, when the complete results of the by-elections came on December 2, the RPP failed to win any of the contested posts. It could secure only 26 votes in the election for chair in ward 6 of Kankai Municipality in Jhapa, also Lingden’s hometown. Similarly, in the election for chair in ward 5 of Molung Rural Municipality in Okhaldhunga, the hometown of the party’s general secretary, Rajendra Gurung, the RPP garnered just three votes. However, the party spokesperson Mohan Shrestha later claimed that Lingden’s December 1 remarks referred to the 2027 general elections, not Sunday’s by-elections.But not all RPP leaders agree with Shrestha. Although some of them admit that the RPP’s agenda is drawing public interest, they blame the by-election losses on the party’s poor strategy and call for introspection. “When smaller parties, like the CPN (Unified Socialist) and Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party managed to win local unit positions, the RPP, the fifth largest party in the House of Representatives, failed to attract public support,” an RPP leader said talking to the Post.The party’s poor show has prompted some leaders to question Lingden’s leadership.“The candidates for the by-polls were selected without a formal discussion in the party,” said one of the party leaders requesting anonymity. “It is the failure of the party chief, and he should take responsibility for the setbacks.” The leader also said the party had performed poorly in the last year’s by-elections for federal and provincial positions.Party spokesperson Shrestha, however, dismisses these claims and allegations, arguing that the party did not lose any local level seats it previously held. “There is no question of the party chief taking responsibility for the outcome,” he said, talking to the Post. Some party leaders, however, allege that Lingden’s arbitrary decisions have caused setbacks for the party on many occasions. They say that Lingden did bring changes during the 2021 general convention, but he has failed to maintain the decorum of a party chief.Lately, internal strife has also intensified within the party. In October, while party general secretary Dhawal Shamsher Rana was undergoing treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, India, Lingden removed him as head of the organisation department and replaced him with senior leader Buddhiman Tamang. Also, Lingden has changed the responsibilities of other senior leaders during the same period. “The party chief’s decision to replace the organisation department chief is tied to the party’s poor show in the by-polls,” a dissident in the party told the Post. The party’s another spokesperson, Sagun Lawoti, thinks the RPP should analyse the by-election results thoroughly. “It is high time the party introspected its strategy,” Lawoti said. Political analysts, meanwhile, say that the RPP's failure in byelections reflects the public’s lack of support for its agenda of reinstating Hindu kingdom. “RPP is clinging to a redundant agenda which has no traction with the people,” Mumaram Khanal, a left-leaning political analyst, said.Below is the RPP’s vote tallies in Sunday’s by-elections, according to the Election Commission website: \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nThe Rs7.34 billion Siddhababa tunnel project is all set for a breakthrough.According to project officials, the 1.12-kilometre tunnel project on the landslide- and rockslide-prone Butwal-Palpa section of the Siddhartha Highway is set to achieve its final breakthrough in the first week of January. Two of the three bypass cross passages have been completed along this busy highway, which connects the hill districts of Lumbini and Gandaki provinces to Butwal and several Tarai districts.According to the project, the first bypass, spanning 151 metres, and the third bypass, measuring 130 metres, have been completed, and 165 metres of the major tunnel work remains to be completed.The project office said that 961 meters of digging on the north and south ends of the main tunnel were completed by Wednesday. Work on the main tunnel is being carried out simultaneously from both ends.“Workers are busy in the main tunnel,” said Krishna Raj Adhikari, the project's chief. The first bypass links the upper Siddhababa temple, and the third bypass connects to the Dobhan dam side. The section, notorious for its dangers, has claimed many lives, prompting the government to construct the tunnel. Over the last decade, at least 421 travellers have lost their lives, and many others have sustained injuries in numerous accidents on the treacherous 4-km road section, according to the District Traffic Office, Palpa.More than 10,000 vehicles ply the road section every day.The China State Construction Engineering Corporation signed the contract in March 2022 with a completion deadline of five years.The project is being constructed under the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) model, where a single contractor is responsible for all components, such as design, engineering, construction, and procurement.The contract binds the contractor to deliver the project within the stipulated timeframe and at the predetermined price, regardless of any possible cost overruns.According to the project office, the tunnel's physical progress has reached 33.59 percent, and its financial progress is at 32.2 percent. “As we are actively working for the main tunnel breakthrough within a month, we have ramped up manpower and resources,” said Adhikari.He said the project has sufficient blasting material in stock, and the construction company has deployed around 150 workers at the construction site to keep the project on track.The tunnel design has progressed as planned. “We have also strictly followed safety measures while widening the road,” said Adhikari. “The work inside the tunnel is progressing rapidly, but work on the outside has yet to start as efforts are underway to control landslides outside the tunnel.”“Rock shed and road designing works are also moving ahead smoothly,” said Adhikari. A rock shed is a protective structure built over a road or tunnel to shield it from falling rocks and debris. This protective covering redirects the falling material safely away, reducing the risk of accidents in landslide-prone areas.To stabilise the hillside around the tunnel in the Siddhababa area, a rock shed has been constructed over 1495 square metres, and work is underway to protect an additional 495 square metres on the northern side. The China State Construction Engineering Corporation was awarded the tender worth Rs7.34 billion. Besides a rock shed, the contractor will also construct rock fall netting and slope protection structures on the outer side of the tunnel.As per the detailed project report prepared with assistance from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the 1.12-kilometre tunnel will have double lanes with a width of 8.5 metres along with sidewalks. Around 900 meters of the double-lane road will link to the Chidiya River on the Butwal side and 560 meters will connect to the Palpa side.The Siddhababa-Dovan road section is the main link between more than a dozen districts in the plains and hills such as Palpa, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, Syangja, Kaski, Parbat, and Baglung.The tunnel is expected to provide safer and easier travel along the highway between the distrticts of Lumbini and Gandaki provinces. \nBarahi Kathmandu hosted an exclusive Christmas cake-mixing event on Thursday in its elegant private lounge, offering stunning panoramic city views.The event saw the presence of several high-profile guests, including celebrities, socialites, high corporate profiles and travel influencers who came together to celebrate the joy of the season, the hotel said in a press statement. Guests participated in the lively activity of blending a rich assortment of dried fruits, nuts, and aromatic spices to create the base for Barahi’s signature Christmas cakes. The private lounge’s luxurious ambience and breathtaking views of Kathmandu’s skyline set the perfect stage for this festive celebration. Roshan Sapkota, general manager of Barahi Kathmandu, expressed his delight at the successful event: “We are honoured to have hosted such an esteemed gathering for our Christmas Cake Mixing Event. This tradition is about more than just creating delicious treats; it’s about fostering connections and spreading festive cheer.With our distinguished guests’ support and our city’s unmatched views, this year’s celebration has been truly extraordinary.” \nOn Thursday, the Special Court convicted 11 individuals, including four top Nepali officials, in a corruption case involving the purchase of two Airbus A330s in 2017 for the national flag carrier, Nepal Airlines.However, Special Court officials say the case is still wide open. More people could be involved in the dubious deal, as cases and investigations in other countries are ongoing.This follows an investigation transcript document on Nepali-born British citizen Deepak Sharma, the former executive of AAR, a US-based aviation services provider, who was the plane supplier. Sharma admitted to the US Department of Justice that he had bribed Nepali officials.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed the possibility of Sharma’s violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act’s anti-bribery provisions.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentencing in the US court is yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.“The Special Court has ordered the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, the anti-graft body, to launch a separate investigation into Sharma,” said Gyanendra Raj Regmi, spokesperson for the Special Court. “The case is still ongoing and open.”The Special Court bench, with Tek Narayan Kunwar as chair and Tej Narayan Singh Rai and Ritendra Thapa as members, convicted 11 individuals. It concluded that procurement of the two wide-body Airbus jets caused the government a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million). The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the payment of the last instalment in 2018.The court has sentenced Sugat Ratna Kansakar, the former managing director of Nepal Airlines, to two years and nine months in prison and ordered the recovery of Rs122.59 million from him. However, since he is 74, he will receive a 50 percent waiver of sentence under the Senior Citizens Act.The court has sentenced former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari, who acted as the chairman of the Nepal Airlines board, to a year and 9 months in prison and asked him to forfeit Rs122.59 million.Likewise, the court has sentenced former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana and tourism joint secretary Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, who were on the Nepal Airlines board, to a year and six months in jail each, and asked them to forfeit Rs122.59 million each. The bench, however, acquitted the then tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, among others, who had been named as defendants by the anti-corruption body.The court has also sentenced former AAR executive Sharma; Christian Nuehlen, a German citizen and former director of Hi Fly X Ireland Limited, Dublin; and Oleg Calistru, a citizen of Romania and Moldova and former finance director of German Aviation Capital; to a year and six months in prison and asked them to forfeit Rs122.59 million each.Similarly, the court has sentenced John M Holmes, president and chief executive officer of AAR International; Ana Topa, managing director of German Aviation Capital; Paulo Mirpuri, president of Hi Fly Airlines Portugal; and Gerald Thornton, director of Hifly X Ireland Limited a year and six months in prison and asked them to forfeit Rs122.59 million each.The court’s verdict, however, highlights jurisdictional complexities.Regmi, the special court’s spokesperson, said the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002 mandates investigations into bribery involving foreign officials could be conducted by Nepali authorities like the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority.Trials, if any, would also fall under Nepal’s jurisdiction.“If both the countries in question are signatories to mutual legal assistance treaties, they can cooperate in evidence-sharing and issue a formal extradition request to bring the accused to Nepal for a trial,” he said. “In this case, the judgment execution body will begin the trial in absentia and issue lookout notices to the defendants if they do not present themselves in a defined period set by a jury at the time of trial.”However, if neither country is a signatory to mutual legal assistance treaties or extradition treaties, there is also an option. Lawyers say the sentence execution body can send ‘letters rogatory’ to obtain judicial assistance from countries where the people charged with crime live.According to Regmi, if they have an agent, office, or assets in Nepal, they will be seized to recover the financial penalty. “Financial penalty can be recovered if Nepal has a treaty or other agreement with the countries. In the absence of a treaty or other agreement, it is difficult to do so.”In the case of Sharma, the former executive of US-based AAR, it’s unclear how Nepal’s court verdict will be implemented as his case [sentencing] is ongoing in the US, too. Sharma pleaded guilty in the US court and agreed to forfeit around $130,000.Regmi said Nepal can issue international arrest warrants against Sharma and other defendants. In the event of a lookout notice or international warrant, they could be arrested outside Nepal through Interpol.According to the charge sheet filed by the anti-graft body in August, the government officials violated the procurement law by accepting the supplier’s escalation condition to purchase second-hand aircraft, which amounted to $6.78 million (Rs745.8 million) of the $209.6 million valuation.Escalation condition is a rule in a contract that says if certain things change, like prices, the contract terms can also change. Investigators suspect the condition was included in the $209.6 million deal to covertly generate kickbacks for the officials involved.The charge sheet states that while finalising the major technical specifications, the aircraft's maximum takeoff mass (MTOM) was decreased from 242 tonnes to 230 tonnes. Investigators suspect financial embezzlement here.The maximum takeoff mass (weight) affects an aircraft’s takeoff distance, rate of climb, payload capacity, and range.The probe found that the Nepali officials made payment for 242 tonnes but ordered aircraft with a capacity of only 230 tonnes, with a cost difference of $6.6 million (Rs72.5 million).Kansakar has been named the mastermind of the scam.In August 2015, under the leadership of Kansakar, Nepal Airlines began the process of acquiring two wide-body aircraft from the European plane maker. On September 11, 2016, the Finance Ministry agreed to act as a guarantor on a loan Nepal Airlines took to procure the two wide-body jets.On September 24, 2016, the Nepal Airlines’ board unanimously approved its management’s plan to procure two Airbus A330-200 wide-body jets. Subsequently, on September 26, 2016, the national flag carrier invited sealed requests for proposal (RFP) from aircraft manufacturing companies, airlines, aircraft leasing companies, and bankers to purchase two A330-200 jets.Separately, the documents made public by the US court show that Sharma had a close connection with a top Nepal Airlines official. A month before the national flag carrier invited sealed requests for proposals (RFP), or on September 1, 2016, a top Nepal Airlines official sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify the MOU signing date, purchase agreement date, and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, the Nepal Airlines official texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”When everything was moving swiftly, Kansakar held a press conference in Kathmandu to say they had found cheaper planes, resulting in considerable savings, which raised many eyebrows.Later, the bid documents said the minimum age of the proposed aircraft cannot be more than 1,000 flight hours, and the date of manufacture should not be before January 2014.In the verdict text, the court argued that Airbus could not sell used planes and that the motive for the dubious deal was evident right from the start.It was informed that the board’s decision to allow Nepal Airlines to buy the jets from the European aviation giant followed the management’s recommendation to switch from Boeing to Airbus, as a one-family aircraft strategy would reduce maintenance and crew training costs. \nThe Health Foundation Nepal (HFN), a non-profit established in 2013 by Nepali doctors in the United States, hosted its 12th annual conference on December 7 in Greensboro, North Carolina.Committed to improving healthcare for underserved communities in Nepal, HFN has been instrumental in addressing disparities in community and mental health and combating non-communicable diseases through its programmes in the Dang and Chitwan districts.One of its notable initiatives, Khushi Ba Ama, provides comprehensive support to senior citizens over 60, addressing both their healthcare and social needs.During the Annual Scientific Meeting, Dr. Shreedhar Paudel, HFN’s chairperson, underscored the organisation's achievements and outlined plans to expand collaborations with the Nepali government and other stakeholders to enhance healthcare initiatives.The conference also featured discussions on global and mental health advancements, with presentations covering topics such as cultural competence in mental health care and the prevalence of depression among Nepali medical students, reflecting HFN’s decade-long impact. \nNearly 30 percent of doctors who completed their master’s degree and sat a recent licensing test of the Nepal Medical Council failed to score the pass mark.According to the council, the national regulatory body of medical doctors, only 175 out of 275 doctors who appeared for the exam passed the licensing test held on Thursday.“Only those who secure the pass mark become specialist doctors,” said Dr Chop Lal Bhusal, chairman of the council. “Those who fail the licensing test have to retake the exam.”The council conducts the licensing test for postgraduate doctors every four months. Those who fail can retake the exam until they pass.This is not the first time such a large number of doctors have failed to secure the minimum pass mark needed to practise as consultant doctors. Officials at the council said the average pass percentage for postgraduate doctors is around 70.“Only 50 to 55 percent of doctors with an MBBS degree pass the licensing test, while around 70 percent of postgraduate doctors pass,” said Bhusal. “What is worrying is a lot of doctors with master’s degrees are failing to secure even the pass marks.”To qualify as a medical practitioner, a doctor must secure at least 50 percent in the licensing exam. Experts say the quality of medical education is being compromised by underachievers who do not deserve to practise medicine entering the profession. “Universities and colleges must pay closer attention to the results of the doctors they produce,” said Bhusal. Licensing tests for medical doctors are a routine procedure in every country. Nepal’s licensing test focuses only on doctors’ knowledge. Some countries also conduct skill tests. Council officials said they had also planned to conduct skill tests in the past, but could not due to the lack of skill labs.“Only the National Academy of Medical Sciences;, Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine; and Kathmandu University’s Dhulikhel Hospital have skill labs,” said Dr Krishna Prasad Adhikari, former registrar of the Council. “We had planned to set up skill labs with support from various agencies, including the World Health Organisation, but things didn’t go as planned.”The World Health Organisation said inaccurate diagnosis, medical errors, inappropriate or unnecessary treatment, inadequate or unsafe clinical facilities and practices, and healthcare providers who lack adequate training and expertise are present in all countries. The UN health body says low-quality health care is increasing the burden of illness and health costs globally. \nThe Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, which has been running a human milk bank, is now providing breast milk to vulnerable infants born in other hospitals.Doctors at the hospital said the purpose of the milk bank is to save infants' lives, regardless of where they are born.“Human breast milk is required for vulnerable infants—those whose mothers died during or after giving birth, critically ill newborns in neonatal intensive care units, premature babies with low birth weights,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, director at the hospital. “We have been supplying breast milk to such infants in other hospitals, including Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Patan Hospital, Norvic Hospital, and B&B Hospital, among others.”The human milk bank, launched some two years ago at the hospital, aims to reduce neonatal deaths, which remains constantly high. Since 2016, neonatal deaths have not declined, despite various measures implemented by health authorities.According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births.Doctors say feeding low-weight babies and critically ill neonates in intensive care units can significantly reduce the risk of infections. The bank collects, tests, pasteurises and stores donor milk from lactating mothers.“The milk is collected mostly from the mothers of ailing babies, who cannot breastfeed their infants admitted to the intensive care units,” said Dr Sailendra Bir Karmacharya, a senior consultant paediatrician of the hospital. “We provide milk only to infants weighing less than 1,000 grams.”According to doctors, human breast milk contains the best source of nutrition and ensures the survival and healthy growth of babies. It bolsters brain development and has lifelong benefits for both the baby and the mother.Karmacharya said that human milk helps in reducing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal problem that mostly affects premature babies. Officials said the hospital needs 1.5 to 2.5 litres of breast milk for babies admitted to the intensive care unit. The human milk bank collects milk directly from mothers of hospitalised babies, but it collects only surplus milk from other lactating mothers, which is then tested, pasteurised and stored at minus 40 degrees Celsius. The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. The 16th five-year periodic plan, which ends in 2029, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from 21 per 1,000 live births. The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes, including hiring staff nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding has the potential to prevent 13 percent of under-five deaths. Studies show that Nepal's exclusive breastfeeding rate has steadily declined over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022, exclusive breastfeeding dropped consistently from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It stated that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), compared to 12 percent of those born at home.Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is prone to contamination and increases the risk of diseases in children, according to the World Health Organisation.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to breastfeed their babies, as studies show. The report shows that the proportion of children who are bottle-fed increases with mothers’ education, rising from 12 percent among children of mothers with no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Bottle-feeding is most common in the highest wealth quintile—46 percent—and least common in the lowest wealth quintile—11 percent.Among the seven provinces of Nepal, exclusive breastfeeding rates are the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest at 11 percent in Karnali Province, 12 percent in Madhesh Province and the highest at 43 percent in Bagmati Province.Doctors recommend breastfeeding for the first two years of a baby’s life or longer, as breast milk lowers the risk of illness in children, promotes their recovery during illness, and provides important nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nEminent city doctors and health experts today gave a call for caution, mass awareness and improved government policies to minimise the use of microplastics that can cause several health hazards, including cancer.Tiny plastic particles that are less than 5 mm are called microplastics and are being attributed to severe respiratory diseases or even some types of cancer. According to Dr Monidipa Mondal, an eminent radiation oncologist, when microplastics enter the body through food or other sources, they first encounter the immune cells. “Being micro-mini in size, they can easily enter the immune cells after which a biochemical agent called cyclophane is released. The cyclophanes prepare chronic information inside the cells. “As we know if chronic information continues to get stored in the cells, it can lead to cancer. Apart from this, cancer is also related to free radicals. Therefore, it also creates oxidative stress in the cells and free radicals in the cells due to which cell multiplication occurs,” informed the doctor.As reiterated by Dr Mondal, recent studies have revealed an increased number of colorectal cancers among people. “It has been found in some studies that microplastics could be a possible driver of colorectal cancer. Another observation reveals a link between breast cancer and microplastic. We have also heard about BPA-free plastic. BPA or Bisphenol-A is an agent that can mimic estrogen. In some cancer cases, estrogen has been found. It can, therefore, be said that if it can mimic estrogen, it could also be a possible cause of breast cancer,” she added.According to research by India Clean Air Network (India CAN), degraded plastic from waste and wastewater discharge due to inefficient treatment processes are two of the major sources of microplastics in West Bengal entering the human body in various ways. The health experts recommended stronger and improved government policies to curb the menace of plastic. As pointed out by Professor Sadhan K Ghosh, mass awareness, particularly among young students is the need of the hour. “The first need is waste segregation. Second, the governance should be such that microplastics are not created for which legislation and its implementation must be done. Also, as plastic becomes brittle and enters our body while swimming or is even consumed by fish that we eat, littering sea beaches should be prohibited,” pointed out the professor.-In Association with ANN \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nJanakpur Bolts continued their unbeaten run in the Nepal Premier League T20 cricket tournament as they overcame Lumbini Lions by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Sunday.Defending a modest 136, Janakpur narrowly held off Lumbini’s pursuit, restricting them to 135-8, with Canadian allrounder Harsh Thaker emerging as the hero to deliver a sensational final over to deny Sundeep Jora the winning run in the morning.Thaker returned astonishing match figures of 5-23 in his magical four-over spell that also included the key wickets of skipper Rohit Paudel (35 off 38), Tom Moores (31 off 23), Bibek Yadav (0) and Saad Bin Zafar (0).The clash reached its climax with Lumbini needing just two runs off the final ball. Jora, who had brought Lumbini tantalisingly close hammering 13 runs off Kishore Mahato in the 19th over, should have overhauled the target or at least collected a run to push the match into the Super Over. Instead, the wicketkeeper-batter attempted an ambitious boundary (or six) and was caught in the deep by Kishore Mahato after Thaker top-edged him.Jora had earlier escaped a run-out on the penultimate ball and was offered a chance to give Lumbini their first victory due to a misfield by Sher Malla but fell heartbreakingly short.Earlier, Anil Sah and Aasif Sheikh added 48 runs for the opening wicket to give Janakpur a strong start after being invited to bat first.Sheikh fell to Zafar (2-11) in the 5.3 overs after scoring 16 runs off 10 balls.Sah then partnered with Lahiru Milantha to share a 47-run partnership for the second wicket to continue the momentum.However, Lumbini’s bowlers hit back hard as Janakpur lost six wickets for just 15 runs, thanks to Abhishesh Gautam’s triple strike and two crucial scalps from skipper Paudel.A late cameo from Shubh Kansakar (22 not out off 24) ensured Janakpur post 136-9.The outcome gave Janakpur a fourth victory on the trot and helped them reclaim the top spot with eight points.Meanwhile, Lumbini’s fourth consecutive loss leaves them rooted at the bottom of the eight-team table, still searching for their first win.Missed chance Sudurpaschim missed their chance to go level on points with Janakpur after Chitwan Rhinos inflicted them their first loss of the tournament, winning by 33 runs later in the afternoon.Chasing 165 for win, Sudupraschim crumbled under pressure and were bowled out for 131.Sudurpaschim started their innings aggressively, with Saif Zaib cracking three fours in a quickfire 18 off 11 balls.Sudurpaschim’s troubles began when Rijan Dhakal (2-33) dismissed Zaib in the last ball of the second over.Binod Bhandari and Brandon McMullen tried to stabilise the innings but Kushal Malla (2-18) dismantled their efforts, removing both batters in the fifth over to leave Sudurpaschim teetering at 45-3.Aarif Sheikh also departed cheaply for four, trapped lbw by Ranjit Kumar.Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton then inflicted critical damage, dismissing Dilpreet Dajwa (12) and Dipendra Singh Airee (1) to reduce Sudurpaschim to 73-6.Ishan Pandey’s spirited 35 runs off 28 balls pushed the chase past the 100-run mark but Amar Routela halted the progress with a double strike in the 16th over, dispatching Naresh Budayair (5) and Pandey.A late effort from Naren Saud (10 off 8) and Scott Kuggeleijn (16 off 10) provided some hope but Dhakal’s catch-and-bowl dismissal of Saud and Tanvir’s lbw to Kuggeleijn sealed the game for Chitwan.Earlier, a half-century from Hassan Eisakhil helped Chitwan, who opted to bat first, post 164-5 from their 20 overs.Eisakhil steadied the innings with a well-crafted 65 off 52 balls after the early loss of opener Santosh Karki (9).Bipin Rawan supported Eisakhil with 17 off 20 in their 50-run stand, and Malla later assisted him with 13 off 16.Kuggeleijn removed both Rawal, Eisakhil and Malla to halt the progress.But Ravi Bopara added late fireworks with a blistering 36 off 18 to propel Chitwan to a competitive total.The result places Chitwan third in the standings, tied on points with Sudurpaschim, who remain in second place despite their defeat. \nChitwan Rhinos handed Sudurpaschim Royals their first defeat in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) on Sunday, securing a 33-run victory in the second match of the day at Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.Batting first after winning the toss, Chitwan posted a competitive total of 164 runs for the loss of five wickets in their allotted 20 overs. Opener Hassan Eisakhil led the charge with an impressive 65 runs off 52 balls, smashing six fours and three sixes. Ravi Bopara contributed 36 runs off 18 balls, including two sixes and two fours.For Sudurpaschim, Scott Kuggeleijn took two wickets, while Dipendra Singh Airee, Brandon McMullen, and Saif Zaib each claimed one.In reply, Sudurpaschim were bowled out for 131 runs in 18.2 overs. Ishan Pandey top-scored with 35 runs off 28 balls, hitting four fours and a six, before being caught off Amar Routela’s bowling. Contributions from Saif Zaib (18), Brandon McMullen (13), and Dilpreet Bajwa (12) fell short as the batting lineup struggled against Chitwan’s disciplined bowling attack.Chitwan’s bowlers shared the spoils, with Kushal Malla, Jean Nicol Leask, Rijan Dhakal, and Amar Rautela taking two wickets each. Sohail Tanvir and Ranjit Kumar chipped in with a wicket apiece.,The win places Chitwan Rhinos in third position on the points table with six points from four matches, while Sudurpaschim Royals hold the second spot due to a superior net run rate. Janakpur Bolts remain unbeaten at the top with eight points.In the earlier match, Janakpur Bolts narrowly defeated Lumbini Lions by one run in a thrilling contest. \nChitwan Rhinos posted a total of 164 runs for the loss of 5 wickets in their allotted 20 overs against Sudurpaschim Royals in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) match at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.Winning the toss and opting to bat first, Chitwan were led by opener Hassan Eishakhil’s impressive knock of 65 runs off 52 balls, which included 6 boundaries and 3 sixes. Hassan was dismissed by Scott Kuggeleijn, caught by Naresh Budhayer.Ravi Bopara added 36 runs off just 18 balls with 2 fours and 2 sixes before being caught by Naren Saud off Dipendra Singh Airee’s delivery. Bipin Rawal contributed 17 runs but fell to Kuggeleijn, caught by Saif Zaib.Among other batters, Santosh Karki scored 9 runs, while captain Kushal Malla managed 13 before being bowled by Kuggeleijn. Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton (2*) and Amar Routela (6*) remained unbeaten.For Sudurpaschim, Scott Kuggeleijn was the standout bowler, claiming 2 wickets. Dipendra Singh Airee, Brandon McMullen, and Saif Zaib picked up one wicket each.Chitwan made two changes to their squad, bringing in Hassan Eishakhil and Ranjit Kumar in place of Sharad Vesawkar and Luke Wankekestain. Sudurpaschim replaced Basant Khatri with Dilpreet Bajwa in their playing XI. \nJanakpur Bolts clinched a dramatic 1-run victory against Lumbini Lions in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) match at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, strengthening their playoff prospects while leaving Lumbini’s hopes hanging by a thread.Chasing a target of 137 runs set by Janakpur, Lumbini managed only 135 runs for the loss of 7 wickets in their allotted 20 overs. With 2 runs needed off the final ball, Sundeep Jora was caught out, sealing Janakpur’s fourth consecutive win.Lumbini’s captain Rohit Paudel top-scored with 35 runs off 38 balls, including three boundaries, but lacked sufficient support. Tom Moores added 31 runs, while Arjun Saud chipped in with 20. Harsh Thaker led Janakpur’s bowling attack with a remarkable 5-wicket haul, conceding just 23 runs. Lalit Rajbanshi, Kishore Mahato, and Sher Malla claimed a wicket each.Earlier, Janakpur, after being put to bat, posted 136 runs for the loss of 9 wickets. Captain Anil Kumar Sah was the standout performer with 45 runs off 39 balls, smashing four sixes and one boundary. Shubh Kansakar remained unbeaten on 22.Lumbini debutant Abhishesh Gautam impressed with a triple strike in one over, dismissing Lahiru Milantha (24), Harsh Thaker (1), and James Neesham (0). He conceded 20 runs in his full quota of 4 overs. Captain Rohit Paudel and Saad Zafar claimed two wickets each, while Jora contributed one.With this win, Janakpur now leads the points table with 8 points from 4 matches, boosting their playoff chances. Meanwhile, Lumbini, still winless after four games, are at the bottom of the standings, making their road to the playoffs extremely difficult.Lumbini must win all their remaining three matches and hope for favourable results from other fixtures to keep their slim playoff hopes alive. \nIn Kathmandu, kite flying, a centuries-old tradition with religious and cultural significance, once flourished during Dashain and Nag Panchami seasons, but has declined due to urbanization, technology, and limited open spaces.\nSince 13th century, Kumaris, young girls from the Shakya/Bajracharya community, have been worshipped as goddesses in Nepal; a tradition with modern reforms including education and later life support, despite ongoing legal challenges.\nJuddha Shumsher Rana built a private zoo in the mid-1930s at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, featuring a diverse collection of mammals, reptiles, fishes, and birds, including tigers, rhinoceroses, leopards, deer, bears, and peacocks.

The Chinese don’t do hasty negotiations. A day earlier, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had met his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang. On the same evening, there was a meeting between Oli and Chinese President Xi Jinping. A joint statement was issued later in the day, outlining all the major developments of Oli’s trip. The much-hyped framework for BRI cooperation had found no mention in the statement. China watchers back home started bemoaning the ‘abject failure’ of Oli’s China trip. But then Team Oli, which included his chief advisor Bishnu Rimal and chief economic advisor Yubaraj Khatiwada, pulled a rabbit out of the bag.The final terminology used to describe the money that will come into Nepal under the BRI rubric has some ambiguity, as ‘aid financing modalities’ can include both grants and loans. But then, such in-between terminologies are common in bilateral negotiations where each side is looking to keep certain constituencies back home happy. The important thing is that both the top leaders of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties in the country, agreed on the term. And when it was presented to the Chinese, so did they. The ‘aid financing modalities’ do not preclude all kinds of loans. In fact, the understanding seems to be that the term means that Nepal will consider low-interest loans such as it was getting from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. That is how it should be. How can Nepal accept loans from the rest of the world but shun it from China? The Congress leadership also seems to have realised the flaw in its earlier reasoning that no kind of loan from China was acceptable. The good thing is that the agreement with China is likely to last as it has the backing of the country’s two major parties, who together make nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority. It was the differences between these two on loans from China that helped them flesh out the outstanding issues over the BRI framework. This in turn added clarity to the issues. (Some differences on the BRI persist inside the Congress, but that is to be expected in a democratic party.) Perhaps the Chinese this time thought that even though they were being asked to hurry, the proposal on the table, which had the backing of Nepal’s two major political parties, was worth signing. There are still many unknowns about the BRI. But at least Nepal stood its ground when necessary, while also not being rigid. This signals a maturing of Nepali diplomacy. After the BRI framework agreement, we again hope that the Congress and the UML and other parties can come to similar understandings on Nepal’s relations with India and the US–and on Nepal’s other vital ties. Consensual foreign policy is the need of the hour. Right now, it is worth celebrating that China, which harboured deep suspicions of the Congress, will be more amenable to dealing with Nepal’s biggest party. Their mutual suspicions were poisoning Nepal-China relations. Perhaps the long-stuck train of the BRI in Nepal will now finally start chugging.  \nWith the by-elections to elect 44 local representatives in 32 districts done and dusted, reviews and analysis of the final results are pouring in thick and fast. Given the palpable discontent against the parties from across the political spectrum, predicting the bypolls results was not easy. Leaders from the CPN (Maoist Centre) have been in a celebratory mood since Tuesday after winning a couple of important seats after years of electoral setbacks. The former rebel outfit that emerged the clear first party in the 2008 general elections had been consistently losing votes and seats in subsequent polls.On the other hand, leaders from the CPN-UML don’t appear excited despite the party winning some important office bearer positions in different local units. The Nepali Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, lost some key positions in a few units as well. Unhappy with the results, the two largest parties have decided to review the outcomes through the respective party mechanisms.One noteworthy feature of the recent bypolls was that voters this time showed little faith in the new forces, unlike in the previous polls. Traditional fringe parties like the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party and the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist) that failed to get national party status in parliament in the last general elections picked up a seat each this time. But new forces such as the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Janamat Party didn’t do well. The RSP won only a ward chair in Kathmandu while the votes garnered by its candidates in other local units were negligible. The RSP, which emerged the fourth largest force in 2022 barely six months after its formation, had done better in the by-elections in April 2023. However, it couldn’t maintain the momentum when a by-election was held to elect a federal lawmaker from Ilam in April this year. The Janamat Party, another outfit that emerged from the last general election, failed to get even a single seat this time. Interestingly, the voters also discarded forces like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party that champions revival of the Hindu monarchy. The pro-monarchy party, the fifth largest in the federal legislature, didn’t win a single seat in Sunday by-polls.For long-term success, a political party needs to have clarity in its agenda and vision, a robust organisation, and strong bond with the general people. Elections are key yardsticks to gauge whether a political party has these strengths. There is broad consensus that the public is disenchanted with major political forces like the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre that have ruled this country by turns for the past two decades. People in previous elections gave a chance to new outfits as they were frustrated by the old forces’ failure to deliver. The level of support these new forces got was perhaps not an endorsement of their vision and agenda, which are sketchy. While these forces succeeded in fanning anger against the incumbents, they failed to offer anything better. Experts caution against drawing hasty conclusions based on the results of elections held for just 44 local level seats. Yet the by-polls were held across all seven provinces, and covered the capital city Kathmandu to remote villages, hills to plains, east to west. In sum, Nepalis are giving a clear message to the political forces old and new: do not take our support for granted.  \nIn under four months, tenth graders all over Nepal will appear in the School Education Examination (SEE). This is a time for students to focus on final preparations. Sadly, hard work alone won’t yield better results when the schools and curriculum fail to cater to their needs. Every year, when the results are out, many students have to endure crushing failure. However, as in previous years, the authorities have failed to learn from their mistakes. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is making baseless predictions of a 70 percent pass rate in the upcoming SEE. How will this be achieved in a country where pass rates have for years hovered below 50 percent?Among 464,785 students who appeared in the last SEE, only 222,472—47.87 percent—secured a Grade Point Average (GPA) above 1.60, which is necessary to study at a higher level. However, 242,313 students—52.13 percent—were categorised as non-graded. After the supplementary exams, over a third of them were graded, qualifying them to study in grade 11. Oli’s forecast is only plausible if the results improve by around 50 percent, which is unlikely. The grading system was introduced in 2016 to reform the examination system, focusing less on marks and more on interactive learning. But the hangover of the old School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exams persists. While the system has been upgraded, the teaching and learning are still the same. Schools are grappling with a shortage of teachers for major subjects like Science, Mathematics and English. Rural provinces like Karnali have suffered the most and some schools are hiring under-qualified teachers to fill the gaps. With teachers unable to address their problems, students have no choice but to rely on rote learning. To cope, the government is focusing on extra online classes. But such online classes for school students hold only symbolic value. In Nepal, fear has always been a tool for teaching and learning. Most schools do not foster an environment where students enjoy learning. This mentality also applies to how the education system views examinations like SEE. Students are put under pressure to perform well, as if it were a “do or die” situation. The shame of failure scars students for life. Some private schools take advantage of this fragile emotional state of students by enforcing mandatory tuition classes. Further, as schools in rural areas can’t complete the syllabus on time, it creates an opportunity for private tuition centres to generate profit as students migrate a few months before SEE to study in such centres. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres.Schedule 8 of the constitution gives local units the authority to manage school education. But the lack of a Federal Education Act, a must to implement constitutional provisions, is a big hurdle towards this laudable goal. Among its various flaws, the controversial Education Bill, registered in Parliament last year, fails to establish minimum criteria for establishing schools. The government must realise that the basics must be fulfilled before setting lofty goals. There must be mechanisms to recruit qualified teachers and retain them. It is also imperative to update the pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. The SEE marks the culmination of over a decade of schooling. Therefore, it is unfair to blame the students who have trusted the system for long. The poor SEE results are a direct reflection of the system’s failure. Whether we have the SEE or the SLC, the flawed education system will continue to jeopardise the future of hundreds of thousands of young students.  \nThe Nepal Premier League, which kicked off on Saturday, has taken the country by storm. Never before had a national-level tournament created such buzz among domestic and international audiences. Nepali cricket fanbase, who grew up watching the Indian Premier League, are now ecstatic to have their own truly international franchise league comprising no less than eight teams. The fact that people from different parts of the country are travelling to the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground to cheer on their favourite teams speaks volumes about the tournament’s mass appeal.The ‘Festival of Himalayas’ features big cricketing names like former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham, Dutch Michael Levitt, Namibia’s Gerhard Erasmus, and Australia’s Ben Cutting. Nepali cricketers—both national players and newcomers—will now get to rub shoulders with these global cricket superstars, which will greatly boost their confidence. The NPL will also hopefully offer these players enough financial incentives to pursue cricket as a profession. In fact, the recent all-format international success of the Indian national team is often attributed to the IPL, for some of the same reasons. The start of the NPL this year could thus mark a sea-change in Nepal’s success in international cricket. The league will have a global audience after getting the Star Sports Network, an internationally established TV network, as the official broadcaster; and after partnering with the Twenty-first Century Media Sports, a company that has managed many international events. They will help showcase Nepal as a global cricket destination. No wonder Nepali cricket fans are upbeat. As one fan placard during Saturday’s opening match between Janakpur Bolts and Biratnagar Kings put it: “No matter who wins it is the victory of Nepali cricket.”Done well, the NPL’s success will resonate much beyond the international sports scene. The vast majority of Nepali youths are looking to leave the country the first opportunity they get. They see no hope in their country. But when they see that cricketers and commentators and organisers from around the world are coming to their homeland to play as professionals, perhaps this feeling of disenchantment with their native country will go down a bit. Additionally, if Nepal can successfully pull off an international tournament like the NPL, there is no reason this welcoming country cannot host tournaments like the cricket Asia Cup. But there will also be challenges. The Cricket Association of Nepal has taken up the monumental task of organising an eight-team tournament. The association’s history of managing similar tournaments is checkered. For instance, the CAN-organised Nepal T20 League in 2022-23 was marred by controversies even before it kicked off due to allegations about match-fixing. The body has also faced criticisms for negligence, delayed payments and incompetence. Even in the opening match of the NPL on Saturday, the association failed to manage the crowd, which in turn led to injuries. The next day, fans were seen running on to the cricket pitch at the completion of a match. In order to maintain the integrity of Nepali cricket, it is vital to minimise such incidents. Hopefully, the CAN is learning with every match. The CAN must get the NPL right, for the tournament’s benefits are potentially limitless. The millions of international TV viewers of the NPL will get to see what a beautiful country Nepal is and this in turn could boost the country’s tourism prospects. The NPL itself, linked to a multitude of stakeholders, can create many profitable jobs, especially as other stadiums are built and the tournament expands to other parts of Nepal. Exciting times, indeed.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nOn Sunday the weather in Koshi Province along with the hilly regions of the country is forecast to be partly cloudy while the rest of the province is to remain partly cloudy to mainly fair.Light rain is likely to occur at one or two places of hilly regions of Koshi, Gandaki, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province.
