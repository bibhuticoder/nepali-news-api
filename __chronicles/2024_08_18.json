Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nBarely a month after exiting from the government, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third-largest party in the House of Representatives, has faced a power struggle between party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma.The conflict between a wartime Maoist commander Sharma and his “supreme leader” Dahal, which had been simmering for quite a while, surfaced at the party’s standing committee meeting that concluded on Thursday.Sharma not only spoke against Dahal but also presented a written document to the standing committee. At the meeting, Sharma asked Dahal to step down as party chairman. Dahal has led the party uninterruptedly for over three-and-a-half decades.At the end of the standing committee meeting, leaders had said that the differences between Dahal and Sharma were resolved. But that conclusion seems premature. The two were busy accusing and criticising each other at a public function in Kathmandu. Dahal had to pacify Sharma on Saturday as he complained of not being trusted by Dahal and other Maoist leaders. “When I was assigned to build an alliance with the CPN-UML, I worked for the same but was tagged as KP Oli’s man,” Sharma said at the function. Later, the Maoist Centre decided to ally with the Nepali Congress, and he worked for the same as directed by Dahal, Sharma claimed. “But I was dubbed Sher Bahadur Deuba’s man. When will I be called the Maoist party’s man? When will you call me Prachanda’s man?” said Sharma, pointing to Dahal, who was sitting at the same podium as the chief guest.Taken aback, Dahal seemed to be consoling Sharma saying that comrade Prabhakar [Sharma] would never split the party, contrary to some media reports.Dahal rubbished reports that Sharma was trying to split the party as baseless and that the days-long standing committee meeting had dispelled all rumours.The Maoist party chief and former prime minister, however, admitted that there were still some confusions and that the meeting had decided to look into the matter and make things clear and resolve them with joint effort.Soon after the party was out of the government, it called the meetings of the standing committee and the secretariat and discussed the Maoist CEntre's future course, including unity with other fringe parties, strengthening the Socialist Front, and building the party’s organisation.“There were some matters of serious suspicion and some still exist. And the meeting has decided to study and find how such a situation of suspicion emerged,” Dahal said. The Maoist leader promised to study the issue jointly with Sharma and, if needed, the party may form a probe committee.“We have reached an understanding to properly address the remaining concerns as well,” Dahal added.Sharma is not alone in demanding that Dahal handover the party’s reins.Even Maoist Centre senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha has asked Dahal to quit the leadership position. A large number of Maoist leaders at the central as well as lower committees want to see an overhaul of the party, said a central member.“If we fail to transform the party, there will be no hope for us besides surrendering to other parties in the 2027 elections,” the leader said.Another central committee member however doesn’t trust Dahal to build the party organisation. “Dahal would rather forge unity with other left parties and, if possible, explore options to contest the upcoming elections jointly with CPN-UML, the country’s largest communist party,” said the central member.The leader said he was unsure if the ruling UML would turn down Dahal’s proposal to join hands once again. According to him, Dahal’s strategy is to bring together left-leaning parties and put pressure on the UML, which leads the government with the backing of the Nepali Congress, to make an electoral alliance with the Maoists. The leader argues that the UML is preparing itself internally to contest the elections on its own, without allying with anyone.“This is the beginning of an infighting in the Maoist Centre because we abandoned the agenda of strengthening the federal, republican and secular Nepal,” said Ram Karki, secretary of the Maoist Centre. “This tussle is unlikely to stop anytime soon.”Because the conflict emerged under Dahal’s ‘schooling’, Karki claimed.He recalled that Mohan Baidya, who supported Dahal’s school of thought, engaged in a similar tussle before leaving the party. That conflict did not subside but intensified, leading Baidya to finally split the party, Karki observed.Later, Baburam Bhattarai, who also emerged allegedly from Dahal’s schooling, led a similar revolt, Karki recalled. “He also deserted the party. This time, too, the tussle has surfaced among those schooled under Dahal, so no one knows the outcome,” said Karki.For decades, Sharma remained a close confidant of Dahal. But he grew up to be a dissident after Dahal refused to appoint him the general secretary last year. Another deputy general secretary, Barsha Man Pun, was also an aspirant for the post of general secretary.Sharma and Pun are taken as Dahal’s lieutenants, right from the launch of the Maoist insurgency in 1996. Sidelining both during the 2022 party general convention, Dahal picked Dev Gurung, who had little influence in the party.Karki described the Congress-UML alliance’s move to oust the Maoist Centre from the government as a good opportunity to strengthen the Maoist party.“If the Nepali Congress and the UML hadn’t ejected our party from the government, we would have been finished by the time of next elections,” said Karki. “As we have been removed from power three years ahead of the election, there is some room for transformation.”Senior party leaders have given Dahal two options: transform himself and the party or vacate the chair that he has been occupying for over 35 years.Another central committee member said that if the conflict was an internal matter and the fight genuine, the party would emerge unscathed. “Otherwise, if external factors are working within the party, then the party will face a serious crisis,” said the leader.However, some Maoist leaders are confident that the party will not face a grave crisis. “Janardan ji questioned the party leadership. Isn’t that a good practice in the party?” said Yubaraj Chaulagain, a central committee member. “However, Chairman Dahal is addressing them.”Chaulagain said that the party leadership would collect reports from the party’s provincial committees and sister organisations and take the right decision based on them. “There’s the proposal for the party’s transformation. It will be discussed. We will gather more feedback and ideas from the lower committees, and follow them,” said Chaulagain. “Gradually, we will address the issues raised by Janardan ji.” \nGoat rearing has attracted farmers in Rolpa, a hill district in Nepal’s midwest. There are 59 households in Korchabang where most families have started commercial goat rearing.Lush forests, plants and trees and a good source of water make commercial goat rearing feasible in Rolpa, the heartland of the decade-long Maoist war that ended in 2006.In recent years, farmers have started growing different varieties of grasses in the villages too.Jokh Bahadur Gharti Magar, a farmer from Minahi, Korchabang, who is popular in the village for rearing many goats, said he is not worried about wild grass as he himself grows the varieties rich in nutrients on his farmland. He can also source fodder from the nearby forest.Magar, who runs a hotel in Minahi, is supported by his family for commercial goat keeping.“I started with a small investment. Later, my family helped me with more funds to increase the number of goats,” said Magar. The veterinary hospital in the district and the animal husbandry centre have also helped Magar and other farmers in their enterprise.The Smart Krishi Gaun programme run by the government for the past three years recognises Magar is one of the successful entrepreneurs. Magar is among high earners from goat rearing in Korchabang. As grass production is good in the area, farmers find the business highly profitable, said Bhim Prakash Pun, president of a farmers’ group.The government, through the veterinary hospital in Rolpa and the Livestock Service Centre, has implemented animal rearing programmes in the region. The Smart Krishi Gaun Programme Implementation Committee looks after agricultural affairs. Kaman Buda, a local politician, said rearing goats by building modern sheds is becoming more profitable.The farmers are rearing goats in better ways and have an income even in the rainy season. It is improving the economic situation, said Prasash Pun Magar, chairman of the Madi rural municipality ward 6. Among 59 farmers rearing goats, the annual incomes of 15 are good.Bhim Prakash Pun, who was in politics before taking up goat rearing, presides over the farmers’ group. He leads the Korchabang Smart Krishi Gaun Programme Implementation Committee.“Commercial goat rearing has become a major source of our income,” Pun said. The implementation of the Smart Krishi Programme and learning about modern ways of raising goats encouraged villagers to start the business. “So I started spending less time in politics and more in business.”The goat rearing initiative under the Smart Krishi Programme started in 2020. Farmers have been trained to cultivate grasses and manage sheds in modern ways.Pun has 20–25 goats, after selling 15 he-goats and 15 kids at once. The money goes to the education of children and household expenses.Around 15 to 20 households in Korchabang have started goat rearing as a major business.Technicians taught the farmers to build modern sheds. They also learnt grass cultivation and feed preparation, said Dr Shankar Neupane, chief of Veterinary and Animal Service Expert Centre. Training on financial transactions was also imparted.To make the 59 farmers entrepreneurs, the government has spent around Rs10.5 million, Neupane said. Jokh Bahadur Gharti Magar, a local farmer, said that the financial and technical support from the government was a big help for them.“From the hotel business, I came back to agriculture and livestock rearing,” Magar said. “After much thought, I took up goat farming by making a modern shed.”Gharti Magar, a former weightlifter, is happy as a farmer. He has 28 goats in the shed and has requested the provincial and federal governments to introduce additional programmes and provide another technician.Subha Bahadur Budhamagar, who also took to commercial goat rearing after a long teaching career, earns well.The government is doing proper inspection, said Matilal Kunwar, officer at Veterinary Hospital and Livestock Service Expert Center.Tirtha Raj Pun and Kaman Budha are rearing goats in Punthok and Jyang villages, respectively. Pun started with four goats and now has 10.Kaman Budha, who is also a trader, served villagers as a social worker. He rears 10–15 goats and takes them to Dang to sell. \nNepal will aim to win the trophy of the SAFF U-20 Championship for a third time when they begin their campaign of the biennial competition against Sri Lanka on Sunday.Nepal are drawn alongside Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Group A. Group B consists of three-time champions and holders India, the Maldives and Bhutan.The group stage matches will be held at the ANFA Complex in Satdobato due to poor condition of Dasharath Stadium’s pitch. All Nepal Football Association had decided to move the group matches to Satdobato citing “unprepared pitch at the Dasharath Stadium”. The decision came after SAFF match commissioner Abdul Hameed Abdul Ghafoor, after an inspection, deemed the Dasharath Stadium unfit to host matches.The poor management of pitch of the country’s only international-standard football stadium drew public criticism on Tuesday when Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda’s Paro FC and Martyrs Memorial A-Division League champions Church Boys United played their AFC Challenge League qualification playoff match in a muddy and puddled pitch, following an afternoon rainfall.ANFA has said that the semi-finals and final will be held back at the Dasharath Stadium’s ground, which is undergoing renovation.Nepal coach Urjan Shrestha said he aims to keep the trophy at home.“We have prepared well. We played practice matches against A-Division League champions Church Boys United and Tribhuvan Army Club. We will take full advantage of the home ground and try to win the trophy,” said Shrestha.However, Nepal will face a tough challenge from their closest rivals India, who have dominated the competition for the last five years, winning the trophy for the third consecutive time [2019 (SAFF U-18), 2022 (SAFF U-20), 2023 (SAFF U-19)].Nepal won the first edition defeating India in the final in 2015 (SAFF U-19) at home and defended the title in 2017 (SAFF U-18) in Bhutan.Only Nepal and India have won the SAFF Championship since its inception.India coach Ranjan Chaudhary said they are also aiming to defend the title for a third straight edition.“We are the defending champions and will play the game likewise. But we are focused on our first match,” said Chaudhary, who will open their defense of the title against Bhutan on Monday.Three-time runners up Bangladesh will also aim to dislodge India’s stranglehold and win their first trophy.Nepal U-20 squadGoalkeepers: Jiyarath Sheikh, Krishal Moktan, Bishal KC Defeneers: Simanta Thapa, Ashwin Ghorasaini, Bikram Tamang, Aayush Timsina, Madan Paudel, Ram Thapa, Samin Ghimiree, Ninsang Limbu Midfielders: Kushal Debua (captain), Avinash Syangtan, Jana Prakash Bam, Lachu Thapa, Saroj DarlamiForwards: Niraj Karki, Harish Raj Bhatta, Dharbendar Kunwar, Anil Bamjan, Samir Tamang, Nirajan Dhami, Rohan Khadgi \nUntil Wednesday, about a dozen-and-a-half activists huddled together in a dimly lit two-room shelter, sleeping on tarps with only thin bed sheets for cover. They relied on muddy water from a hand pump for hydration and used a roofless crumbling toilet.This group lived in a makeshift shelter at the Thapathali squatter settlement in Kathmandu, paying a monthly rent of Rs10,500.Among them was Nandakishor Ram Bibsh, a Chure conservation activist, who endured the harsh conditions for two months despite having a home and family back in Rautahat.“I’m not a squatter, yet the government forced us into this position,” Bibsh says. “Our suffering could have meant something if the government had listened, but all we got was silence.”The deafening silence forced them to reconsider their approach. On August 14, Bibsh and his fellow activists, who began their 25-day march from Saptari to Kathmandu on April 28, decided to leave the Thapathali camp.After over three months of sit-in amid harsh conditions, they returned to Janakpur, frustrated at the government’s continued inaction.Sunil Yadav, the central coordinator of the Chure conservation campaign, emphasises that their return is a start of the second phase of their protest. In their next move, the activists plan to raise public awareness by staging protests in every district of Madhesh before returning to the Capital with a bigger force by the end of August.On August 22, they even plan to hold large-scale demonstrations in front of the Madhesh chief minister’s residence.Yadav and his team aim to draw the government’s attention to the Chure range, a strip of geography running along Nepal’s east to west as the foothills above the plains that is devastated by over 30 years of deforestation, illegal mining and encroachment. This environmental damage has led to severe consequences like water shortages, landslides, soil erosion, and crop failures, impacting thousands who live there and down south.Equally appalling for the protesters is the government’s indifference. “We came to the Capital with empty buckets to symbolise the urgent need for water conservation. Those buckets got filled with our frustrations at the government’s indifference,” Yadav said.The poor living conditions during the march and protests have taken a toll on many activists’ health. Many had to travel back and forth between Madhesh Province and Kathmandu to manage personal affairs, health, and their responsibilities to the campaign.“It’s a shame that I had to leave my family and endure such hardships just to be heard,” Bibsh says. “We were driven to sleep on the streets and had to live in the squatter settlement. I don’t know how much more suffering the government needs to see.”On July 31, heavy rain flooded their residence in the squatter settlement in Thapathali, causing great distress among the activists. “Every time it rained, I was terrified that the roof might collapse,” says Sangita Sada, a 37-year-old from Lahan in Siraha district.During the protest, Sada frequently battled fever from the cold seeping through the floor and the harsh conditions. “I wasn’t the only one,” she says. “Almost all of us suffered from fever and cold multiple times.”Despite her illness, Sada forced herself to rise early each morning to fetch muddy water from the hand pump and cook for the group. She would then participate in the sit-in protests from 10 am to 6 pm before returning to the settlement to prepare dinner for the night.“We couldn’t afford jar water. We had no proper facilities for cooking, bathing, or toilets,” Sada adds.Elderly participants like 65-year-old Shanti Devi have endured even greater hardships. Devi, from Dhanusha, now suffers from chronic back pain as a result of the 25-day march. “I will have to use a walking cane forever”, said Devi.The activists have a 12-point list of demands. These include enacting a Chure Conservation Act, designating the Tarai as a dry zone, banning sand and stone mining in riverbeds, addressing pollution in the Sirsiya river, and stopping environmentally harmful construction projects. They also seek an investigation into forest workers involved with smugglers in illegal extraction activities.In 2014, the Nepal government declared the Chure an ‘Environmental Protection Area’ and established the President Chure-Tarai Madhesh Conservation Development Board (PCTMCDB) to oversee its conservation. However, research from November 2019 reveals that the board has struggled with its ad hoc approach and lacks a fully empowered office, integrated policies, and an independent conservation fund.Amidst the protest, Sada’s savings of Rs11,000 were spent on medicine and basic needs, while her husband struggled to support their family through his labour wages.Now, back home, Sada faces criticism from villagers for mingling with men and being away from her family. “As a woman participating in these protests, I face constant judgement, but I won’t give up,” she says. “Water is scarce, and I fear I won’t be able to provide my grandchildren even a glass of water.”In Madhesh, locals in districts like Bara and Rautahat now rely on water tankers due to declining water levels. Farmers are using water pumps and seeking alternative income sources, leading to the closure of many rice mills, according to Yadav.Upon arriving in Kathmandu, the activists first stayed at a small hotel but moved to the office of the Madhesi Nijamati Karmachari Manch due to financial constraints after one night. After 20 days, they were asked to leave the office. They then found accommodation in a squatter settlement with no other option.Struggling with rent and basic needs, they sought support from people in Madhesh and spent their meagre earnings. “Managing funds was tough, especially as many of us fell ill,” says Bibsh. Kiran Paudel, chairperson of the PCTMCDB, shares that he has sent the memorandum of campaigners’ demands to the Ministry of Forests and Environment.“We are planning on a Chure Conservation Act within the next three months and actions for river conservation,” Paudel says. “We are just a board—demands such as declaring the Tarai a dry zone, banning riverbed mining, and halting harmful construction projects are politically complex, requiring provincial and federal attention.”On August 5, the activists marked their 100th day of protest with a march from Maitighar to the prime minister’s residence in Baluwatar, aiming to draw the government’s attention.During this time, “we have suffered losses that have been too hard to swallow,” says Yadav.Elderly activist Nanda Mukhiya from Janakpur died on July 22, due to health complications worsened by the harsh living conditions during the march and protest. Despite his deteriorating health, Mukhiya had insisted on continuing the protest until he was forced to return home, where he died shortly thereafter.Bibsh argues that if the Khas Arya Pahadi community were affected by Chure destruction or staged a similar march, it would be a major national topic. “Madhesh issues are often overlooked in Nepal. We are rightful citizens, and the Chure issue affects the entire country,” he said.As they prepare for the second phase of their protest, the activists continue to fight for Chure’s future. The pressing question remains: how much longer will their voices be ignored, and what more must they endure to be heard?Sada worries that the next time they return to Kathmandu, they may not even secure space in a squatter settlement and might end up sleeping on the streets due to lack of funds. “How long should this continue?” she asks.“At Maitighar Mandala, I saw many give up, exhausted by the government apathy. Can it truly be called a government if it wears out its own people seeking justice? If we fail, whose failure is it—ours or the government’s?” \nI was invited to a literary programme organised by Srasta Samaj and Bhairav Puraskar Guthi on August 19, 2024, in Kathmandu. A note was appended to the invitation—Rochak Ghimire would turn 84 on that day and would be felicitated by a large group of writers and readers. Being very familiar with the literary contribution of Ghimire, this news unfolded a history of the literary times to me. Ghimire has made history as a publisher of the literary magazine Rachana, which started in 1961 when Nepal was on the cusp of an era that introduced several political and ideological challenges. The conspicuous response to the sensitivity of the times came from literary magazines. Roop-Rekha, a prominent literary magazine, came following hard on the heels of Panchayat, an autocratic system of government introduced by King Mahendra after dissolving people's elected parliament and jailing Prime Minister BP Koirala in 1960. I have drawn more examples of how literary magazines responded to such systems later in the article. Ghimire made a humble start, which was the best way to remain outside the influence of the nascent political system called Panchayat. He spent Rs500 to publish 300 copies at that time. I remember writing a long survey and analysis of the 100 issues of Rachana, which was published in the magazine in 2008. Remarkably, the literary magazine continues to this date and brings together cohorts of people who write literature and those who come to listen to literary discourses in literary programmes. Ghimire has been doing that through Rachana.Literary magazines were published at different times of the long autocratic Rana rule (1846-1950) in Nepal. They were the best means of creating a forum of expression, which would be creative and metaphorical. A careful study of Nepali literature written over the times shows that some of the most creative minds of this land had chosen literary writing as the medium of their expression. But it was challenging during the Rana regime. The writers, therefore, chose some easy ways. One was publishing literary magazines from Banaras, but they would not publish articles that would directly earn the wrath of the Rana rulers. Banaras had become the hub of publication for the Nepali writers who were either studying there or doing some small publication works. They would publish books on religious, social, folk and astrological themes and sell them within Nepal. Scholars have analysed this theme under the rubric 'print capitalism' by using a term introduced by Italian professor Francesca Orsini. I have no space to discuss the theme here.That activity was quite prolific in Banaras from the last years of the 19th century and the first or second decades of the 20th century. Editors and writers published their works and 'marketised' them among the Nepali language readers in Nepal and India. A small but quite diverse reading public came into existence. The literary magazines published by the youths there set a tradition of publication. They created forums to express their feelings and ideas couched in the language of religion or social or ethical writings. Literary magazines like Upanyas Tarangini (1902), Sundari (1906) and Madhavi (1914) were published from Banaras. But another centre, a hill area of Darjeeling, followed that tradition. The publication of Paras Mani Pradhan's Chandrika (1918) is one example. The magazines published in the 30s of the 20th century from Banaras and Kathmandu had a strong connection. They wanted to create a reading public whose sphere was small but important. The role played by 'print capitalism' was remarkable. In that context, the publication of Nepali Sahitya Sammelan Patrika (1931) from Darjeeling, Sharada (1934) from Kathmandu and Udaya (1936) from Banaras should be mentioned here.The publication of Sharada from Kathmandu is a vital event in Nepal's literary times. A cohort of writers decided to establish a forum to publish their views and inner feelings through symbols, metaphors and stories. The path was arduous, as they had to convince the Rana Prime Minister Juddha Shumsher, who was not happy about such a publication. But he saw some energy working there and allowed the writers to proceed with the work. He didn’t want them to cross a certain limit, though.Nepali literary critic Yadunath Khanal interpreted that juncture of time as a moment of tacit agreement between the writers and PM Juddha Shumsher. In one editorial of Sharada compiled in Sharadaka Sampadakiya Bicharharu (2001) by Shiva Regmi, we can read an important story. The editorial was obviously written by Riddhibahadur Malla.When a group of writers got an appointment to meet Juddha, he was sitting with a British envoy named Col CT Dox. An interpreter communicated the ideas of the British official to the writers. Dox's opinion was that since there was already a government newspaper named Gorkhapatra, there was no need to ask for another magazine. The envoy had also said to Juddha earlier, \"Now we are facing problems in Hindustan for allowing other papers to publish.\" Juddha asked the writers to heed the suggestion of the British envoy and not be enthusiastic about publishing Sharada. But as Yadunath Khanal said, Juddha allowed the writers to publish a literary magazine named Sharada in the winter of 1934. That was a tacit agreement between the rulers and the writers. However, the reference to the British anxiety regarding freedom to publish newspapers and magazines is notable. That also shows how the literary writers kept up the spirit of freedom and creative thinking through such tacit agreements. It was possible only through literary expressions. Literary magazines also came into existence after the political turn of the 1950s and of the 1960s. The continuity of the literary magazines run by individual literary persons like Uttam Kunwar and Balmukunda Pandey's Roop-Rekha, Rochak Ghimire's Rachana, Nagendra Sharma's Abhivyakti, Achyutraman Adhikari's Unnayan and a few others are unforgettable milestones of Nepali literary journeys. A survey of similar icons of the literary times of other languages of Nepal would make the picture complete. Literary magazines have traversed the difficult but important terrains of awakenings in this land.  \nRecently, a 34-year-old male with a two-day history of fever, nausea, weakness and body aches was admitted to the emergency department of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Kathmandu. His oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 95 percent on room air, and he tested positive for Covid-19. Covid-like illness is rising in the community, especially since the beginning of the monsoon season. It indicates that the disease itself might be circulating in Nepal. In fact, as per the World Health Organization (WHO) data, Nepal has observed a drastic increase in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, from 5.56 percent (week 28) to 13.68 percent (week 31) in a three week-interval (i.e., between July 8-14 and July 29-August 4). The variant responsible for the rapid increase of Covid infection rate in the community is unknown. Hence, it has been termed “monsoon covid” here.By the end of May 2024, Nepal had confirmed several Omicron sub-variants, including KP.1, KP.2, KP.3 and KP.4, also known as KP or “FLiRT” subvariants. Dozens of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 have been admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital since the beginning of March 2024. Most of the patients were aged 65 and above and required the intensive care unit. Until now, there is no evidence of an increase in hospitalisations due to monsoon covid. Nonetheless, it cannot be definitively ruled out that it may become severe in the upcoming days in Nepal. In the past, Nepal has typically experienced waves of Covid-19 following outbreaks in neighbouring India due to their shared border. Thus, we usually predict that when a Covid-19 outbreak occurs in India, Nepal will inevitably see a wave of Covid-19 after a couple of weeks or months. Nevertheless, this time, Nepal is observing monsoon covid before India, and it currently has the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in the Southeast-Asian region. As per the WHO data, India has maintained a constant rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the past four weeks (between week-28 and week-31), and in fact, even decreasing trend to 0.73 percent (i.e., July 29- August 4) from 3.26 percent (week-28, i.e., July 8-14). It is uncertain whether the monsoon covid will hit India in the coming days, but it is not impossible. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the main symptoms of Covid-19. However, the symptoms have varied over multiple waves with people exhibiting atypical symptoms like silent or happy hypoxia, loss of taste and smell and flu-like illness. Notably, the patient who visited STIDH did not have a cough and shortness of breath but exhibited a low platelet count, which is unusual in patients with Covid-19. Such a changing pattern of clinical symptoms of Covid-19 over the period is not surprising. The absence of cough, shortness of breath and the presence of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count, i.e., 70,000 per microliter of blood) is a rare phenomenon and thus worthwhile to study further. More cases, however, are needed to fully comprehend the monsoon covid and its evolving symptoms. Viruses evolve over time, and become more or less severe. We can, therefore, expect Covid-19 to continue to evolve with more genetic mutations in the coming days. Unfortunately, are unaware of the increasing trends of monsoon covid in Nepal and its reasons. It is wise to identify mutations or analyse genetic sequencing to understand the resurgence of monsoon covid.As of now, the seasonality of Covid-19 is not well established in Nepal. However, there have always been peaks (small or big) of Covid-19 cases during or around August in the past. Based on past data, we can assume that Covid-19 can reappear during the monsoon season every year in Nepal. Then, the question arises: Can we consider Covid-19 a seasonal virus like the influenza virus in Nepal? It is unknown whether monsoon covid will cause an increase in hospitalisations in the coming days, as seen in March 2024, owing to KP or “FLiRT” subvariants. However, such a scenario should not be underestimated. Although vaccines against the virus are available, people are not interested in getting jabbed. Preventive measures also help to avoid it, but vaccines are still important. Continuous surveillance, genetic analysis and vaccination should be prioritised. \nAnother August 14 has passed by with familiar proclamations about the evil designs of the proverbial ‘foreign hand’. As usual, outside conspirators are complemented by enemies inside our own borders. The list is long and comprised of absurdly opposed actors like retired spy chiefs and a women-led Baloch peace movement. Blanket categories like ‘digital terrorism’ are devised.The now months-old ban on social media sites like X has been extended with the operationalisation of a long-touted digital security system (also known as a firewall). Leaving aside for a while the absurd notion that all of this makes us safer, let us focus on the economic fallout that has been triggered.Pakistan is reportedly the fourth biggest gig economy in the world, with millions of (mostly young) people generating incomes through a host of digital platforms. There can be no romanticising the realities of pla­t­form capitalism; it is exploitative, has my­r­iad gendered effects and is cause and consequence of the unprecedented com­m­o­­d­i­f­i­c­a­tion of social life. Yet beggars can’t be choosers in a country where land grabbing, khaki real estate schemes, hoarding, contraband trade, useless mega infrast­ructure projects and the like represent the dominant model of ‘economic development’.Unlike most variants of Pakistani capitalism, the gig economy’s one saving grace is that it generates some employment opportunities for young, educated segments of the population, thus offsetting some of the demographic pressure that is culminating, with almost two million people joining the labour force annually.We have been here before. Temporary bans on YouTube, TikTok and other big social media sites have suffocated the livelihoods of those who have had more or less success monetising their content. Increasingly regular moves to suspend mobile data have badly affected precarious workers reliant on food delivery, ride-sharing and many other apps.The current internet clampdown is affe­c­ting all this as well as call centres, software developers, digital marketing and many other sub-sectors. Even basic commu­nications apps like WhatsApp have been crippled. A number of foreign companies—most prominently Fiverr—have suggested they will soon shift their operations away from Pakistan because their daily losses run into the millions. I care less abo­ut the profits of multinationals than I do about the call centre workers who are being deprived of even their meagre daily wages.The latest hybrid regime started off exhorting the need for foreign investment, and has now succeeded in thwarting its own stated imperative. In 2022, digital freelancers brought in $500 million, which is at least as much concrete currency than we’ve actually see come into the country through the much-touted SIFC.Our khaki-dominated ruling class is so consumed by palace intrigues and the windfall profits of big office that it is unable to see where it is taking what is already a sinking ship. When X and WhatsApp are dee­med threats to ‘national security’ because urban middle class types from military and civilian backgrounds—previously the biggest defenders of the established order—are now using these platforms to criticise the inc­umbent regime, it is obvious that the est­ablishment and its lackeys have lost the plot.It is unsurprising that the powers are petrified by youth-led movements in the peripheries, including the women-led Baloch Yekjheti Committee. Such movements are anti-establishment, and represent a threat to all warring ruling class factions. But here too even a slightly competent ruling class with an eye for the future would realise the clamping down on social media to suppress the group’s reach is a double-edged sword because digital freelancing helps incorporate at least some young disaffected Baloch (as well as Pakhtun, Sindhi, Gilgit-Baltistani, Kashmiri, Seraiki) youth into the system.But there is little competence here, only gimmicks like ‘Digital Pakistan’. Meanwhile young working people in the once-loyal Punjabi heartland are seeing their fragile middle class aspirations go up in smoke, which is, in turn, generating even more disaffection as evidenced not only through political opinions in digital spaces but also in the realms of art and culture. All of this can certainly be suppressed, but the economic pressure cooker cannot bubble over indefinitely.Let me be clear: the decision to suffocate the digital economy mostly affects white-collar youth. The vast majority of our blue-collar working population has no outlet whatsoever, other than menial jobs and emigration by any means necessary. But they could care less, so we should expect more of the same to come. Without a meaningful, countrywide alternative to the game of the thrones, we will all be reduced to freelancers for ruin.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nEighteen years after the decade-long Maoist insurgency (1996-2006) ended, there is finally some hope of justice for the victims. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives endorsed the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act 2014. (The bill has yet to pass the National Assembly and the President’s authentication, which will take some time.) This long-overdue amendment has also brought a much-needed relief for everyone who advocated for justice and reparation for those affected. The latest step will pave the way for completing the pending tasks of seeking truths about insurgency-era cases of violence and possible closures.Some provisions in the TRC Act called for amnesty to perpetrators of serious human rights violations. Several governments have been formed and toppled since the Supreme Court in 2015 directed the authorities to make necessary revisions to the Act. Years went by with no urgent actions, and justice remained a pipedream. Only recently did the leading parties—Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and Maoist Centre—heed the bill introduced by the former premier and Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal last year. Even though the bill has received a positive response from many quarters, including diplomats and heads of international organisations closely watching Nepal’s peace process, some human rights activists and victims are still concerned about some provisions in the bill. It categorises rape or serious cases of sexual violence, enforced disappearances and intentional killings as non-amnestiable, which is a sensible provision. But it allows for amnesty in other human rights violations cases and allows for reducing the sentence by up to 75 percent if perpetrators fulfil some set criteria except in rape or serious sexual violence cases, leaving space for manipulation. The bill also omits the issue of child soldiers used during the insurgency, and this is a serious concern. Given such flaws, there are genuine concerns as to whether the leaders are simply trying to end the chapter with minimal changes. That the major parties have come together to conclude this long-pending issue is laudable, but they shouldn’t use the bill to appease political factions or collect brownie points. The three leading party chairs—Sher Bahadur Deuba, KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal—marked the endorsement as a matter of national pride. Dahal, the chief architect of the insurgency, said he hoped it would “lead the country towards the conclusion of the peace process.” The first step the leaders should take is to work towards appointing officials to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of the Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons, both of which have been left in limbo for over two years. The next step is to heed the concerns and disagreements of the stakeholders of the peace process and resolve them. The TRC dream will translate into reality only with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a just and respectful environment for the victims. It remains to be seen if the law will be implemented as promised and hoped. If not, it will betray the very principles of justice and reparation upon which Nepal’s peace process was founded.  \nAt least 17 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli strike in the central Gaza town of Zawayda on Saturday, health officials said, as Israel issued new evacuation orders, citing Hamas rocket fire nearby.Israel also announced the names of two soldiers Israeli media reported were killed on Saturday afternoon when a roadside bomb exploded in the central Gaza Strip, and an air strike in the occupied West Bank that it said killed two senior Hamas militants involved in the killing of an Israeli.The violence occurred before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was expected to land in Israel on Sunday and meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, amid stepped-up diplomatic efforts to conclude a deal to end the fighting between Israel and the militant Islamist group and free Israeli hostages.Most of the people killed in Zawayda were from the same family and they included eight children and four women, according to health officials in the Hamas-administered enclave.“They were asleep in their beds, kids and babies, then three missiles targeted their place,” said Abu Ahmed Hassan, a neighbour. The owner of the house was a known merchant, he said. “There are no military activities here at all,” he added.The Israeli military said in response it had struck militant targets in an area from which rockets were fired at its troops. It said the incident was under review.Israel’s military spokesperson posted instructions in Arabic on X on Saturday for people in parts of central Gaza, including in the Maghazi district near Zawayda, to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone.Reuters could not immediately verify whether Zawayda was among the places ordered to evacuate and whether people there had received the military’s instructions. Residents said thousands were streaming out of Maghazi.On Friday, two sections of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis within what Israel has designated as a humanitarian zone were deemed dangerous by the military, which ordered people to evacuate them, saying militants had been regularly firing rockets from there.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Friday’s orders, which also included other areas of the enclave outside the humanitarian zones, had affected around 170,000 displaced people.“This is one of the largest evacuation orders affecting the zone to date and it shrinks the size of the so-called ‘humanitarian area’ to about 41 square kilometres, or 11 per cent of the total area of the Gaza Strip,” an OCHA report said.In the central part of the enclave, residents said Israeli tanks advanced further on Saturday into the eastern area of Deir al-Balah, an area they had not entered before, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.The Israeli military said that since Friday its forces had killed dozens of militants, including some who had fired rockets from central and southern Gaza.Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population has been displaced by the 10-month-old Israeli offensive, which has laid waste to much of the enclave.Another Israeli airstrike on a car in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin on Saturday killed at least two more Palestinians, one an 18-year-old, the Palestinian health ministry said.CEASEFIRE TALKSGaza ceasefire talks in Doha, mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt, were due to resume next week.A statement from Netanyahu’s office said Israel’s negotiating team had expressed “cautious optimism” on the possibility of advancing a deal “in accordance with the updated American proposal (based on the May 27th framework), including components acceptable to Israel.”US President Joe Biden said on Friday, following two days of talks in Doha, that efforts to reach a deal were now in sight, although he warned that negotiations were “far from over”.Hamas spokesman Jihad Taha told Al Jazeera TV on Saturday that Israel had added conditions in the ceasefire talks and accused Netanyahu of using these to hinder the efforts.Asked about Blinken’s visit to the region, he said the group did not rely on the US as it has been biased towards Israel.Another Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told Al Jazeera that Israel wanted the right to return to the fight even if a prisoner exchange was agreed. “They want to have the right to attack Gaza whenever they want,” he said.The war was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel’s subsequent military campaign has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel has lost more than 330 soldiers in Gaza since its ground operations there began after Oct. 7, and says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters. \nToday, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, Karnali Province, and Sudurpaschim Province are expected to experience generally to mostly cloudy conditions, while the remaining provinces will see partly to generally cloudy skies. Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is likely in various parts of Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with a few showers also expected in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.There is a possibility of heavy rainfall in isolated areas of Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces.Tonight, the entire country will witness partly to generally cloudy conditions. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is expected in many parts of all provinces. Heavy rainfall may occur in some areas of Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces.On Saturday, Janakpur recorded the highest maximum temperature at 38.4°C, while Jomsom reported the lowest minimum temperature at 14.5°C. Bhairahawa received the most significant rainfall, measuring 21.6 mm in the past 24 hours. \nThe Nepali Embassy in Canada has cautioned students preparing to study in Canada about the opportunities and challenges they might encounter there.Citing that students might feel they faced “unprecedented hardship” if they were initially lured by tempting stories, the embassy urged students to be cautious.“Take time to research the opportunities and hardships you are likely to encounter in the new country before making it your destination,” read the statement issued by the embassy.The embassy suggested that students would encounter fewer problems if they conducted adequate research and gathered detailed information about their college, the subject they wish to study, the costs involved, and the location of the college before applying.Before making Canada their study destination, all are advised to obtain enough information from relatives, friends, peers, former students, social media networks, non-resident Nepali associations in the respective cities, and Nepali diaspora organisations about the college, its location, the method of study, expenses, availability of housing, and employment opportunities, the embassy added. \nNepal has been selected as the host of the 2025 ICC U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup Asia Qualifier, set to take place from April 12 to April 21, 2025.The Asia Qualifier is one of the five regional qualifier tournaments to determine the final five teams for the 2026 U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup, with Africa Qualifier, European Qualifier, East-Asia Pacific Qualifier and Americas Qualifier being the other four competitions.One team from each (five) region will qualify for the main event.“Nepal has been selected as the host nation for the ICC U19 Men’s Cricket World Cup Asia Qualifier 2025,” the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) said in a press release on Saturday. The Asia Qualifier will feature Nepal (hosts), Afghanistan, Hong Kong, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The teams will vie for one spot in the 2026 U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup. “This event marks a significant milestone for cricket in Nepal, and the nation looks forward to welcoming these teams and showcasing its passion for the sport on an international stage,” the cricket governing body added.With home support, Nepal will look to qualify for the World Cup for a consecutive time after featuring in the 2024 ICC U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup in South Africa. Nepal had topped the six-team table remaining unbeaten to secure their ticket to the 2024 World Cup—their first World Cup in eight years.In South Africa, Nepal had pulled off a thrilling one-wicket victory over Test member Afghanistan in the group stage to progress to the Super Six. The 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by Zimbabwe and Namibia. \nNepal's Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba will visit India from Sunday to Thursday for talks with her counterpart S Jaishankar, aimed at strengthening Nepal-India relations and promoting cooperation on various areas of mutual interest.\nNepal will deploy drones to remove garbage from Mount Everest, using DJI heavy lifters to reduce risks faced by Sherpas during supply transportation tasks.\nIn the Nepali Congress, two young general secretaries, Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma, have struggled to assert their authority amid a dominant establishment led by party president Deuba, despite their initial popular mandate.\nAjaya Dixit emphasizes the importance of river conservation, highlights the problems caused by human encroachment, and advocates for a holistic approach to river management, integrating natural sciences, social sciences, and indigenous knowledge.\nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \nIn the past, Nepali students did not dream of studying at prestigious American and European universities. People weren’t captivated by travelling across continents or romanticising life in Europe. Instead, they lined up along the trails of Kuti, drawn to the allure of Tibetan monasteries. Nepalis imagined Tibetan nymphs serving salted tea with cheerful smiles, embodying their aspirations.It was a time when the elegance of men and women dressed in Kuchin robes and Chinese silk surpassed any modern luxury. Faith, trade, and fame converged in one place; for Nepalis, that place was Lhasa.Dor Bahadur Bista's ‘Sotala’ is set in a distinct era when “all roads led north”. It was a time when the routes to Lhasa were bustling, with traders carrying their goods and dreams. The story is set in 18th-19th century Nepal and Tibet, a period when trade across the Himalayas was flourishing, Hindu and Buddhist cultures were intertwined, and the wealth of Nepalis was on the rise. Though short, the account is historical and fictional, blending imagination with truth. Bista's story goes beyond mere characters and events, exploring the rich historical, social, cultural, and political landscapes of the time.Instead, ‘Sotala’ offers a broad commentary on the entire sociopolitical and cultural fabric of 18th-century Nepal Tibet. Like Émile Zola's ‘Germinal’ and Lisa See's ‘The Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane’, Sotala enriches sociocultural commentary through its fictional settings. It presents compelling characters, engaging plots, and fascinating insights into anthropology, sociology, and philosophy, making it much more than just a work of literature. This blend of elements is because Bista isn't just a literary figure; he is a renowned anthropologist. He is best known for his nonfiction works, such as ‘Fatalism’, ‘Development’, and ‘People of Nepal’, which brought him recognition outside the literary world. However, his talent extends beyond academia. In ‘Sotala’, readers can see how he applies his academic knowledge to craft a refined work of historical fiction.The book draws from Bista's time as the Consul General in Tibet, where he gained extensive knowledge about Tibet and Nepal-Tibet relations. His insights are evident in his non-fiction work, ‘Reports from Lhasa’. As the Nepali consulate was the only foreign presence in the region, Bista had a unique opportunity to observe Tibetan culture closely. In a 1997 interview with Fisher, Bista described ‘Sotala’ as a distinctive blend of fiction and ethnography. He explained, \"In a way, it's a novel, but at the same time, I included a lot of ethnographic material.\"Further elaborating, Bista said, “If I had pursued anthropology further, I might have stopped creative writing. Conversely, if I hadn’t studied anthropology, I would have focused solely on creative writing. I became a blend of both, half this, half that.”Sanuman, an honest and successful Nepali merchant living in Lhasa, narrates the story. Through his recollections, we are introduced to his past. As Sanuman reflects on his life, the events gradually unfold. He recalls his childhood in Jaisidewal, where he was once captivated by a girl from his neighbourhood. His mother was determined to make the girl her daughter-in-law. However, fate intervened when the son of the wealthy Tuladhar, who had made his fortune in Lhasa, abducted her. In Lhasa, Sanuman first encountered the unpredictable nature of life and fortune.Unable to face the humiliation, Sanuman leaves home with dreams of Lhasa and limited finances. Various challenges mark his journey: sometimes, he is mistaken for a thief and detained by officials, and other times, he makes unfortunate mistakes. The story chronicles both his triumphs and misfortunes.Sanuman begins his journey as a tradesman and a traveller with Sankhu Saau-an, a shrewd businessman trading in Lhasa. As his apprentice, Sanuman learns the trade secrets of Tibet. He follows Sankhu Saau-an’s example, eventually building his business empire. The narrative tracks Sanuman's transformation from a humble apprentice to a successful merchant and from a young bachelor to a proud father.Following Sanuman’s journey, we are introduced to the everyday realities of that era. For instance, on his first trip to Lhasa, Sankhu Saau-an instructs Sanuman to deliver goods to the Nepali customs official's lodgings. In his naivety, Sanuman asks for payment for the merchandise. This action angers the official and teaches Sanuman a crucial lesson: success in trade requires more than just calculations; a merchant who couldn't master the art of bribery was doomed to fail.The book also addresses political issues, cultural differences, and economic realities. It portrays the class system in Tibet and the exploitation of the peasantry during the oppressive Lamacracy. The struggles and hardships faced by the people are a central theme. Additionally, the book highlights the superstitious aspects of Tibetan society, such as the use of the Dalai Lama's urine as a potent medicine, showcasing the peculiarities of that culture. It contrasts Tibet's traditional customs and orthodoxy with Kolkata's role as a hub of innovation and progress.The book effectively explains the trade practices of the time to illustrate this contrast. It describes how the old, challenging route through Kuti was eventually replaced by the more convenient and accessible Kalingpong route. The decline of Kathmandu's prominence favouring Kolkata and the subsequent decline of Nepali merchants are thoroughly examined. The book emphasises and masterfully chronicles this transformation, showing how traditional methods of trade and commerce evolved with the introduction of new tools and modern logistics.While ‘Sotala’ offers a broad and engaging narrative, it has some literary flaws. The story begins with a single narrator but later shifts to multiple perspectives, confusing readers. The plot sometimes feels rushed; other times, it must be faster, with certain characters introduced but left underdeveloped. Additionally, frequent changes in setting and introducing new plotlines can further puzzle readers.Despite these shortcomings, ‘Sotala’ compensates with its rich cultural, sociological, political, and anthropological context. It is more than just a work of fiction; it blends anthropology, ethnography, and sociology into a compelling fable, making it a valuable read.Pokharel is a third-year BALLB student.SotalaAuthor: Dor Bahadur BistaPublisher: Sajha PrakashanYear: 1976 \nCPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has been leading the party for over three-and-a-half decades, has yet again pacified the leaders who want him to hand over the leadership.Janardan Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—deputy general secretaries of the Maoist party—had demanded that Dahal hand over the party leadership to a leader of their generation. The two leaders raised the issue during the standing committee meeting that commenced on August 9.Leaders concluded the meeting on Thursday as they decided to strengthen the Maoist party through internal dialogue between the leaders on their disagreements.Party secretary Ram Karki said that responding to the questions raised during the standing committee meeting on August 10, party chair Dahal vowed to address their issues.The party will resolve the theoretical as well as ideological differences among the party leaders through dialogue, Karki told the Post, quoting Dahal.On August 9, the first day of the meeting, the Maoist chair presented a verbal proposal on current political affairs, party building, and other pertinent issues.After Dahal’s presentation, some leaders raised questions about the party’s policies and leadership. Among them, Janardan Sharma, a deputy general secretary, submitted a written proposal on August 10, calling for a review of Dahal’s leadership and suggesting that the party chair be limited to a ceremonial role as patron.In his document, Sharma alleged, among other things, that the party leadership was trying to use state power against him.In the 14-page document submitted to the meeting, Sharma accused the party leadership of ‘spreading disinformation’ about him and the other deputy general secretary, Pun. He also accused the top leaders of even misusing state power against him.“The fake information about the party split, which was generated from Khumaltar [the private residence of Dahal], spread widely after reaching Baluwatar [the prime minister’s official residence where Dahal was staying until last month when the government changed],” Sharma questions the party leadership in his document. “There are questions: why did the leadership disseminate fake information?”However, Maoist Centre leaders said the issue has been settled, for now, after Dahal pledged to resolve it through intra-party discussions.Party chair Dahal, while speaking to the press briefly after the conclusion of the standing committee meeting on Thursday, said the reports and rumours about party split were baseless.“Rumours related to the party split led by comrade Prabhakar [Janardan Sharma] are baseless,” Dahal told journalists.The meeting also decided to hold consultative meetings at the provincial level, where the party's office bearers will also participate. After the meeting, the party will call for a full-fledged meeting of the central committee in mid-September (Ashoj first week).Another party secretary, Devendra Paudel, said the upcoming central committee meeting will call the party's special general convention, as decided during the eigth general convention held in 2022.But Lilamani Pokharel, a party secretary, says no decision was taken with regard to convening a special general convention as only the central committee has a mandate to call a special general convention, the supreme body of a party that can take final decisions on the party’s policies and leadership.“The party will go for a special general convention only if a central committee meeting decides to go for that,” Pokharel told the Post.After the party was out of the government in mid-July, calls for Dahal to relinquish the top position have grown. Haribol Gajurel, a close aide of Dahal and deputy general secretary, also raised the issue of leadership change during a meeting of party officials before the standing committee meeting and demanded a special congress to address the issues.Gajurel proposed that all office-bearers should resign and make a fresh start to rejuvenate the party. He even submitted his own resignation as a starting point. Following this, on the second day of the standing committee meeting held on August 10, Deputy General Secretary Sharma questioned the central leadership in his political paper.However, party spokesperson Agni Sapkota, who is close to Dahal, argued that the questions raised by Sharma were aimed at strengthening the party. “The issue I raised during the standing committee meeting was for the betterment of the party and to strengthen the leadership of Dahal,” Sapkota quoted Sharma as saying.“The party leadership has also taken the issue raised by the standing committee members, including deputy general secretary Gajurel, Sharma, and Barshaman Pun, on a positive note.”During Dahal's tenure as prime minister, Gajurel, his political adviser, had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the party's lack of adherence to procedures and methods. As questions arose about the central leadership of the Maoist Centre, which is focused on organisational development, Dahal found himself in a defensive position during the standing committee meeting. According to party insiders, it was after a long time that Dahal faced tremendous pressure during a standing committee meeting as both Sharma and Pun, who have strong command in the party organisation, stood together to demand Dahal’s exit from the party leadership. It was something unusual for Maoist leaders as the two leaders, who defended Dahal in the past, joined hands by closing their ranks to fiercely criticise the party chief. Sharma and Pun, both former finance ministers, are deemed the two most powerful leaders after Dahal.Both leaders claimed the position of general secretary at the party’s general convention in early 2022. Though they were willing to contest for the post, Dahal instead chose Dev Gurung as the general secretary. After the general convention, Sharma has been maintaining a distance from Dahal and he challenges the party chief on various occasions. Of late, Pun, too, has joined Sharma to challenge Dahal. At the standing committee meeting, Pun said there should be a debate on the party's chairperson's term limit. \"Instead of discussing whether the leader should step down now, we need to determine the chair’s term limit,\" he added. Leaders said Dahal faced a pressure of this scale in a party meeting probably for the first time in nearly a decade, since the exit of key leaders Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya. Bhattarai and Baidya lead their own parties now. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana is set to visit India from August 18-21, on her first official trip after taking office.The visit by the foreign minister comes a week after new Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri concluded a two–day familiarisation visit to Nepal just this week. During her time in India, according to the foreign ministry officials, Rana will hold talks with her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar and other officials and discuss several issues of mutual interests.Separate requests have been sent for meetings with Indian PresidentDroupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with confirmation still pending, according to foreign ministry officials privy to the visit preparations. She will also meet senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders.“We are waiting for confirmation for both the meetings as Prime Minister KP Oli is keen to host Indian Prime Minister Modi in Nepal,” an official said. “It is the Indian prime minister's turn to visit Nepal, so our focus would be on making that visit happen,” the official said. Rana was planning to visit Delhi for a routine health checkup, but after India expressed interest in turning it into an official visit, she received an invitation from her Indian counterpart, Jaishankar, sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.Rana and Jaishankar are scheduled to meet in New Delhi on Monday to discuss issues from the seventh joint commission meeting in Kathmandu earlier this year, according to the officials.The Joint Commission meeting reviewed all aspects of bilateral relations and areas of cooperation including connectivity, infrastructure development, economic partnership, trade, transit, investment, power, water resources, culture, tourism, sports, health and education.During her meeting with Misri on Monday, Rana requested additional air routes to Nepal to increase air connectivity between Nepal and India, setting up a sophisticated laboratory at the Nepal-India border to test the quality of the vegetables and fruits imported from India for pesticides, expediting the negotiations for the finalisation of the detailed project report of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project that remains in limbo for years. They also discussed issues such as discharging the water from the Tanakpur canal, river training in the Banganga, Khado, and Rapti rivers with Indian assistance, and the inauguration of the suspension bridge in Darchula linking Nepal and India, according to the foreign ministry statement. The upcoming visit is expected to focus on discussing matters of mutual interest rather than signing understandings or agreements, a joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post. \nDiscussion on whether or not to have statute of limitations in corruption cases takes the centre stage as the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the House of Representatives works to finalise the bill to amend the Corruption Prevention Act 2002.The KP Sharma Oli government in 2019 had registered the amendment bill in the National Assembly. After long deliberations, the Assembly had sent the bill to the House after endorsing it in April last year. However, the lower house is still debating it. The statute of limitation is a bone of contention.A provision in the bill says, “The corruption case must be prosecuted within five years from the date of knowing that such an act has been committed.\" But there is no time limit in lodging the case where the state suffers direct losses.Even if someone is retired from any profession, s/he can be prosecuted within five years of retirement, says another provision in the amendment bill.After the discussion on the limit in the parliamentary committee, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority has proposed to widen the window to 10 years.However, the parties have yet to agree on the matter. While some Nepali Congress and Rastriya Swatantra Party lawmakers want removal of the provision, other parties have not made their official positions clear yet.Oli, who appeared before the House committee on July 22, made no comment on it. CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was present during the discussion in the House committee on Thursday, also did not make his position clear.“Let’s have an intensive discussion on whether to keep the statute of limitations and for how long,” said Dahal. Congress leaders, however, are vocal against such limitation. Reiterating his position, Nepali Congress lawmaker Gagan Thapa said there can be no statute of limitation in corruption cases.Thapa, who is also the Congress general secretary, has registered a proposal to remove the limit.Taking part in the deliberations on the bill on Thursday, Congress lawmaker Hridaya Ram Thani said no corruption committed before 2018-19 can be investigated if five years of limitation is imposed.“On the one hand, we are talking about investigating the corruption cases after 1990. On the other, there is the issue of five-year limitation. This is contradictory,” said Thani.An official at the constitutional watchdog said it is the legislature’s prerogative whether or not to have a limit of investigating corruption cases. Thani demands that the bill must give investigators the mandate to examine the decisions from the local level to the federal Cabinet for irregularities. He said that “policy decisions” should be explained in the law. So far Cabinet decisions in particular are legally exempted from investigation.The ruling UML is yet to make its position clear on the time limit. Experts have expressed concern that if the bill is passed, it will not be possible to prosecute those in power. They will use it as a loophole to obtain clean chits, they say.Sharing his views on the bill, Dahal, the prime minister preceding Oli, said that the provision of automatic suspension of those holding public offices once the commission lodges a case against them in the Special Court needs to be revisited.Citing incidents of the accused getting clean chits, he said there should be discussions on incorporating the provision of no suspension until conviction.“Or compensate for the period of suspension if [the person is] acquitted by the court [later],” Dahal said. “This is not my conclusion but just a food for thought.” \nEnding nearly a decade of confusion, the House of Representatives on Wednesday endorsed the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act by a majority vote.The amendment to the Act was necessitated after the Supreme Court in February 2015 struck down provisions that allowed amnesty for serious violations of human rights, directing the government to make necessary revisions. Despite this directive, successive governments until recently made no serious attempts towards changing the law as directed by the top court.The serious visible efforts to this effect was seen when the chiefs of the major three parties on July 1 formed a three-party mechanism to find a common ground on the contentious provisions in the bill. With consent from the top leadership the mechanism on August 7 reached a written agreement on the bill. Based on the tripartite agreement, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the lower house approved the bill, which was under consideration for over a year, the very next day. The erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government had in March last year introduced the bill in parliament. It was under consideration for more than a year following differences among the parties on the content until last week’s agreement.The bill that was presented in parliament on Tuesday got endorsed the next day after all the lawmakers except the only one from the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party stood against it. Addressing the House, before the bill was put to a vote, top leaders of big parties claimed the country was moving towards accomplishing the remaining task of the peace process—the transitional justice. Putting his view before the lower house, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said Nepal’s transitional justice process would be completed by adopting Nepal’s own homegrown model. “The commissions will get full shape with the new Act in place and they will get a favourable environment to function,” said Oli, who also is the chairperson of the CPN-UML. “Our transitional justice process will be exemplary, setting an example to the world.”The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of the Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons are lying paralysed for over two years in the absence of their office bearers. Although a committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former Supreme Court chief justice is in place, it has not been able to function following the National Human Rights Commission’s refusal to send its representative demanding amendment to the Act.Also addressing the lower house, Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba claimed that the bill ensures truth, justice, reparation and non-occurrence of the conflict. “It adheres to our existing laws, the verdict of the Supreme Court and international standards of transitional justice,” he said.Similarly, CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal said the endorsement in the bill will lead the country towards the conclusion of the peace process. “Our peace process is a model in the world. We are leading it with our own experience and methods,” he said.While the top leaders unanimously claimed that the bill ensures a victim-centric transitional justice process with no amnesty for serious violations of human rights, the victims and the human rights defenders have divided opinions on the bill that got through the lower house. A group of victims united under the National Network of Victims and Survivors of Serious Human Rights and National Association of Conflict Rape Victims have jointly welcomed the endorsement of the bill calling it a historic achievement. Ram Bandari and Devi Khadka coordinators of the two associations respectively have jointly said that the bill is in line with the demands of the grassroots victims for prompt truth, justice and reparation. However, Charan Prasai, a human rights activist said the bill is full of flaws guided by amnesty even in serious violations of human rights. “The parties had in 2015 introduced the law unanimously, but it was struck down by the court. The bill endorsed on Wednesday too is full of problematic provisions,” he said.The bill lists rape or serious cases of sexual violence, intentional or arbitrary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture as serious violations of human rights and thus non-amnestiable. Other incidents fall under human rights violations and are amnestiable. One of the provisions in the bill clears the way for reconciliation in cases other than serious violations of human rights. The attorney general cannot be forced to press ahead with a legal case in incidents of human rights violations or serious violations of human rights where there has been reconciliation or a recommendation for amnesty, according to the bill.Except in cases of rape or serious sexual violence, there can be a reduction in the sentencing by 75 percent if the perpetrators fulfil some set criteria. Decisions on reduced penalty can be taken after examining whether the perpetrators provide information on the allegations against them, whether they cooperate with the commissions on evidence collection and whether they express remorse for their acts. Similarly, before recommending a reduction in penalty, the commissions need to evaluate whether the perpetrators have apologised to the victims and made commitments to not repeat such acts. All disqualified Maoist combatants including child soldiers, along with the families of security personnel who died or got injured during the insurgency, will get reparation and compensation, as per the agreement. However, the issue of child soldiers, which is considered a war crime, along with crimes against humanity and other acts of war crime is not mentioned in the agreement.Now the bill will be forwarded to the upper house for approval. It will come into force after the authentication from the President.Meanwhile, some Kathmandu-based diplomatic missions have welcomed the development. Within hours after the House endorsed the bill, the envoys took to social media to congratulate Nepal terming it a historic achievement.US Ambassador Dean R Thompson congratulated the people of Nepal on the occasion. \"This is a meaningful moment in Nepal’s journey to shaping its own peaceful, prosperous, resilient, and democratic future,\" he wrote on X.United Nations Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer-Hamdy described the passage of the bill as a crucial step in the peace process. “Engaging victims is imperative - 'nothing for us without us' - for successful implementation,\" she wrote on X. “The UN stands ready to support inclusive TJ aligning with international human rights commitments and standards.\"Also, Veronique Lorenzo, the ambassador of the European Union to Nepal, congratulated Nepal and Nepali people for the historic achievement. Describing it as a Nepal-led and owned, victim centric TRC bill, the EU welcomed the achievement and reiterated its commitment for full support in its implementation. \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nBarahi Jungle Lodge has been announced as Nepal’s first hotel to receive certification under the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) Hotel Sustainability Basics programme.This certification recognises hotels that excel in sustainability by implementing essential criteria for responsible operations. Barahi Jungle Lodge’s achievement highlights its excellence in three core areas: energy efficiency, planet-friendly operations, and community support. The lodge has implemented various measures, including reducing energy consumption, eliminating single-use plastics, and actively supporting local communities. This dedication sets a new benchmark for sustainable hospitality in Nepal. In addition to the WTTC certification, Barahi Jungle Lodge has also been awarded the TOFTigers Outstanding Certification, a testament to its commitment to conservation and responsible tourism.The WTTC’s Hotel Sustainability Basics is a global standard designed to guide hotels in their sustainability journey, with 12 fundamental criteria covering environmental, social, and operational practices. \nAfter the devastating earthquakes in 2015, Nepal saw a dramatic shift in dietary habits, stimulated by the inflow of cash for reconstruction. This massive cash inflow also led to an explosion in the availability of packaged snack foods.Now, people are avid consumers of fast food and packaged foods, and the trading and manufacturing of such food businesses are growing exponentially.This inadvertently increased the demand for unhealthy foods as people become accustomed to readily available options, according to the Global Food Policy Report 2024, published by the International Food Policy Research Institute recently.These foods with low nutritional content are packaged and ready to eat at any given point.“The emergency food aid provided after the earthquake included packaged foods like instant noodles,” the report said.Poor diet quality is a significant reason for poor nutrition outcomes. The report, authored by multiple experts, covers Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia, South Asia, East and South East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.According to the report, 45 percent of Nepal's population consumes salty and fried snacks. The country's vegetable intake has been poor, with 11 percent of the population consuming “zero” vegetables and fruits.The report said progress is slowing on reducing undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies in low- and middle-income countries while observing a rapid rise in overweight and obesity rates. This double burden of malnutrition—where undernutrition coexists with diet-related noncommunicable diseases—poses significant global health challenges.The report also stresses that food systems significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation, urging their transformation to reduce environmental impacts while ensuring food security. Malnutrition rates remain high, and non-communicable diseases are rising in South Asia.“With the increased consumption of packaged food, particularly by the children, it has sharply increased childhood obesity. Overconsumption of zero nutrition and zero calorie packaged food has increased the malnutrition rate in children, especially school-age ones,” said Dr Sudhashree Adhikari, a nutritionist.“Immature growth in children and disturbance in the menstruation cycle is being seen in women, largely due to the consumption of packaged and processed meat and dairy products. These products often contain growth hormones used in poultry, dairy, and cattle production.”“Producers inject hormonal growth supplements into poultry to speed up production, and these hormones get stored in the animal’s organs,” she said. “When people consume these products, it can lead to hormonal imbalances.”Adhikari said that hormonal imbalance in women and chronic hypertension and diabetes in men have sharply gone up mainly due to the high intake of carbohydrates that are found in packaged and processed food.According to experts, the low and middle-income brackets have been cutting their healthy food intake from their plates with the rising prices of vegetables and dairy products.The report said nearly 80 percent of Nepal's population cannot afford a healthy diet as healthier food options cost more in countries with poorer infrastructure and logistics.It has been several months since the prices of most green vegetables crossed over Rs100 per kg. For instance, even a kg of bottle gourd, a common and seasonal vegetable, costs around Rs120 per kg in retail.As Nepal does not produce enough fruits, most of the fruit requirements are fulfilled through imports. For example, a kg of Chinese Fuji apples costs around Rs400.The report said that only 1.1 percent of Nepali adults (over 15 years old) consume 400 grams of fruits and vegetables daily, which is the WHO's recommendation.Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants that protect against numerous diseases.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, vegetable inflation increased by 16.02 percent in mid-June compared to last year.For example, lately, dairy companies have struggled to sell milk. They have converted the milk into powder and butter, but even these products remain unsold, leaving tonnes of the products piling up in the warehouses of the state-owned and private dairies.Both state-owned and private dairy companies said the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for several months.Nepal’s growth rate, which measures the country’s output and people's income, has remained dismal, averaging 3.4 percent in the last five years.Import figures show the clear picture of how packaged foods have grown and displaced traditional food habit systems.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 2,420 tonnes of chocolates worth Rs1.66 billion in the last fiscal year ended July 15.The country also imported 4,146 tonnes of sweet biscuits worth Rs997.62 million, 1,657 tonnes of Kurkure and Lays worth Rs911.78 million, 2,818 tonnes of dalmoth and namkeen worth Rs800.95 million, and 1,867 tonnes of packaged bakery items worth Rs612.58 million.The country imported 1,609 tonnes of chewing gum worth Rs582.74 and 1,478 frozen French fries worth Rs226.26 million.Hem Raj Regmi, the deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office, said that packaged and processed food consumption is increasing in the country mainly due to rapid urbanisation, a rise in single families, a growing number of working women, and changing food habits.“The remittance is the key. It has fueled the consumption of such products,” said Regmi, who holds a doctoral (PhD) in food security.He said that remittances affect food expenditure in two distinct ways.“When you have money, you increase your calorie intake, but income from remittances may also compound trends toward purchasing less healthy foods associated with the nutrition transition.”Experts said that unchecked sale of packaged and processed food items, especially in rural parts of the country, easy availability of counterfeit food and beverage products with no quality inspection, and the import of packaged food products high in palm oil and sugar are causing severe health issues in the majority of people.The government's lax inspection has also led to an increase in traders selling expired food items by relabeling them.In Nepal, 39 percent of the population consumes all five recommended food groups, including at least one starchy staple, one vegetable, one fruit, one pulse, one nut and seed, and one animal-source food, the study states.The report said poor diets are caused by a mix of factors: insufficient crop diversity; low affordability due to low per capita income and higher prices of nutritious foods; inefficient, underdeveloped markets and value chains; easy access to highly processed foods; and aggressive promotion.According to the poultry association, an egg now costs around Rs25 in retail, up from Rs17 a year earlier and has become out of reach for most low-income people.The report said that in 2050, no countries in sub-Saharan Africa and few countries in Asia and the Pacific could supply the World Health Organization’s minimum recommended daily per capita intake of 400 grams of fruits and vegetables.Adhikari said that vegetables and fruits fulfil the required micronutrients, like vitamins and minerals. Live enzymes, Vitamin B12, and calcium are also found in vegetables and fruits, and such products are less consumed. \nDespite regular supply, the prices of most vegetables in Kathmandu Valley have gone up sharply, forcing the majority of Nepalis to cut the recommended daily vegetable intake.Traders said that farmers have increased the rates of vegetables due to the rise in the cost of production.The comparative price index of the wholesale vegetable market in Kalimati shows that the price of vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and other seasonal and non-seasonal vegetables has increased within two weeks.“The supply situation is normal,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the country’s largest vegetables and fruits marketplace. “Normally, the vegetable price goes up in the rainy season. This year, farmers have increased the prices of their crops, and as a result, prices have increased sharply.”He said that farmers’ crops have been hit by excessive rainfall. The heatwave, too, affected production. “To compensate for their losses, vegetable prices increased at the farm gate.”The Kalimati market received over 700 tonnes of vegetables on Wednesday, which is considered a normal supply.The wholesale price of all three different types of tomatoes has increased. The price of tomato big (Nepali) has increased by 26.67 percent to Rs95 per kg, while the price of tomato small (local) has jumped by 101.52 percent to Rs45 per kg, and the price of tomato small (tunnel) has gone up by 92.13 percent to Rs61 per kg.The potato price has also increased significantly. The price of potato red (Indian) has increased by 3.64 percent to Rs57 per kg, potato red (Mudhe) has gone up by 15.69 percent to Rs59 per kg, and potato white has risen by 4.57 percent to Rs53.33 per kg.The dry onion price increased by 18.63 percent to Rs97.67 per kg. Shrestha said the onion price has been impacted by the rise in the Indian onion price.The wholesale price of cabbage (local) has jumped by 30.05 percent to Rs75 per kg within two weeks. The wholesale price of cauli local (Jyapu) has also risen by 15.79 percent to Rs110 per kg.On Thursday, the Cowpea (long) price increased by 26.67 percent to Rs95 per kg.The price of bottle gourd has increased by 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg and smooth gourd by 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg.Despite being seasonal vegetables, the price of pointed gourds has increased. The wholesale price is Rs75 per kg, up 36.36 percent.Similarly, the price of French beans (local) increased by 46.15 percent to Rs95 per kg, while the price of French beans (hybrid) also increased by 46.15 percent to Rs95 per kg within two weeks.The wholesale price of sword beans climbed by 4.55 percent to Rs115 per kg.The prices of squash (round) and okra have also gone up. The squash round price has gone up 30.77 percent to Rs85 per kg, and the okra price has gone up 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, vegetable inflation increased by 16.02 percent in mid-June compared to the same period last year.A separate report said that Nepalis are consuming fewer vegetables and fruits due to cost factors and their growing habit of consuming packaged foods.According to Global Food Policy Report 2024, published by the International Food Policy Research Institute last month, in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, children under two years get a quarter of their calories from unhealthy snack foods and beverages.The report said that only 1.1 percent of Nepalis adults (over 15 years old) consume 400 grams of fruits and vegetables daily, which is the WHO's recommendation. The report showed that Nepal’s consumption of salty and fried snacks is high among South Asian nations, with more than 40 percent of the population eating them.Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants that protect against numerous diseases.The report said that in 2050, no countries in sub-Saharan Africa and few countries in Asia and the Pacific could supply the World Health Organization’s minimum recommended daily per capita intake of 400 grams of fruits and vegetables.The cost premium—that is, the additional cost for the least-cost nutrient-adequate diet above the least-cost source of calorie adequacy—is larger in South Asia than in any other region.For example, dark green leafy vegetables and vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables cost 8 to 22 times more per calorie than starchy staples and twice as much per calorie as sugary and salty snacks.A study in a low-income country revealed substantial changes in food behaviours over the past decade, with increased consumption of rice, meat, and highly processed snack foods. \nYeti Airlines has obtained the ISSA (IATA Standard Safety Assessment) certification for international safety standards, which highlights the airline’s unwavering commitment to the highest standards of aviation safety. “We are extremely honoured to have received the ISSA registration, which is a significant achievement in our ongoing journey to enhance safety and operational excellence,” said Subhas Sapkota,CEO of Yeti Airlines. “This achievement reflects the hard work and dedication of our entire team, as well as our commitment to providing our passengers with the safest and most reliable air travel experience.” The ISSA programme thoroughly evaluates the airline operator’s safety management system before awarding the certificate. \nAmid heavy rainfall in many places across the country, Anbukhaireni Rural Municipality of Tanahun district has been hit by a massive dengue outbreak, with over 900 positive cases in a single ward within a month.Local health facilities are struggling to cope with the overwhelming number of seriously ill patients.“Over 900 people from ward 3 have tested positive for dengue within a month,” Agam Raj Upadhyaya, health coordinator of the rural municipality, told the Post over the phone from Anbukhaireni. “Forty-five patients are currently being treated on just 15 beds at Anbukhaireni Hospital. The hospital floors and corridors are packed with infected people.”Health officials warn that the actual number of dengue cases could be higher, as people having mild symptoms are not getting tested and are resting at home.They also informed that around two dozen seriously ill patients have been sent to Chitwan, Pokhara, and Kathmandu for further treatment.“What worries us most is that with the spike in positive cases, we are also seeing an increase in seriously ill patients,” said Upadhyaya. “These patients need intensive care, which is why we have to refer them to Chitwan, Kathmandu and Pokhara.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.So far two died and 3755 tested positive with the dengue virus that has spread in 74 districts across the country.Public health experts say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic. Data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division shows that only 715 people have tested positive for the virus in Tanahun, far less than what is reported by the rural municipality.“We don’t know how they are counting, but we have reported all the confirmed cases,” said Upadhyaya.Other health officials also told the Post that health authorities are misrepresenting the true extent of dengue infection and deaths.Public health experts warn that dengue cases could escalate in the coming days as heavy rainfall continues across the country and post-monsoons season, which is considered the main dengue season, is yet to start.“The coming days will be more challenging for us, as dengue cases could surge,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Shukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital at Teku in Kathmandu.Public health experts criticise the authorities for their narrow focus on merely counting cases and deaths, which does little to control the spread of the deadly disease.Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained from previous outbreaks are implemented.Meanwhile, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division on Friday issued new guidelines to control the spread of the dengue virus. The guidelines stress the need for searching and destroying mosquito larvae, but do not recommend insecticide spraying, as past experience shows that this measure is futile in controlling the epidemic.Officials say fogging with insecticides is only a symbolic measure and does not effectively kill larvae, pupae, or eggs, particularly if done during the day. Experts say a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts.At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has alerted all agencies concerned about the growing risk of the spread of mpox, also known as the monkeypox virus, in communities.The division’s alert follows Wednesday's declaration of a global public health emergency by the World Health Organisation. The UN agency defines an international public health emergency as an “extraordinary event” that poses a serious public health risk.“We have also asked concerned agencies and officials to step up surveillance measures and send people suspected to have contracted the virus to the National Public Health Laboratory for the test,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the division. “We also held a discussion with the representative of the UN health body in Nepal and other officials concerned about the potential risk of the mpox virus spreading.”Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. It is the second time since the UN health body declared mpox a global health emergency in two years, as the virus has spread alarmingly in the African continents and is at risk of entering other continents. The WHO said that 524 people died and more than 14,000 cases of infection have been reported this year alone in Africa, which exceeded last year’s figure.The mpox virus is transmitted through close contact such as sex, skin-to-skin contact, and the respiratory tract or mucous membranes.Doctors say animal-to-human transmission often occurs through bites, scratches or direct contact with infected animals’ blood, body fluids or wounds. The virus causes flu-like symptoms.Nepal had confirmed mpox infection in June last year after a 60-year-old foreigner tested positive for monkeypox infection.Public health experts say that every disease seen in any corner of the world is possible to come to Nepal due to the high mobility of its own people and foreign tourists. They say it is relatively easier for people from any part of the globe to come to Nepal and that it increases the risk of any disease seen in any part of the globe arriving in Nepal.“We cannot keep repeating the same mistake. When Covid spread in China, we thought that since we did not have a direct flight from disease-hit areas, the chance of the disease spreading to Nepal was low, but this proved to be wrong,” said Dr Shrawan Kumar Mishra, director at the provincial Public Health Laboratory of Madhesh Province. “Many people from our country travel to Africa, and our UN peacekeepers also serve there and return home. Anyone coming back from disease-hit countries must be kept in isolation for three weeks.”Experts say screening at the health desks of international airports and land crossings alone is not enough to prevent a possible outbreak of monkeypox in the country since symptoms usually appear between five and 21 days after infection. Moreover, not everyone will have visible symptoms on their skin or limbs. They say that asymptomatic persons can also transmit the virus.Symptoms of the mpox virus include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it. Doctors say that even though monkeypox infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the authorities concerned should not underestimate the risks.Globally, more than 87,000 cases and 112 deaths from monkeypox were reported in 2022, according to the WHOThe UN health body said it is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers on potential vaccine donations and coordinating with partners through the interim Medical Countermeasures Network to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools. \nAmid a surge in new coronavirus cases in the country, the Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to roll out a Covid vaccine across the seven provinces.Officials said that elderly people, those with compromised immunity, and children between five and 11 years will be jabbed with the monovalent coronavirus vaccine supplied by the COVAX facility last month.“Most of the provincial health offices have already placed demands for the vaccine,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We will start supplying vaccine doses to provinces within a week.”The monovalent or single component vaccine is designed for the Omicron sub-variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Lately, Nepal has witnessed a rise in coronavirus cases. The World Health Organisation’s report on integrated influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance for week 31 of 2024 shows a SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 13.68 percent in Nepal. Also, the latest data from the National Public Health Laboratory indicates a sharp increase in cases. Of the 5,373 tests conducted since January, 341 came out positive for Covid. The test positivity rate is 6.3 percent, which is concerning, according to experts.Doctors say that the number of people suffering from fever, sore throat, body aches, and common cold has risen.The COVAX facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, supplied Nepal with 1.6 million monovalent vaccine doses in the first week of July.Officials said that around 100,000 children with underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.Along with these children, pregnant women, people with compromised immunity, those with chronic diseases, and people over the age of 55 have been designated as vulnerable groups, officials said.Since the end of the second wave of Covid in 2021, health authorities across Nepal have stopped active case finding, including contact tracing and free testing. Hospitals now only conduct tests for those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for travel abroad or for seriously ill patients with respiratory conditions. Multiple doctors the Post spoke with said that the circulation of coronavirus has never stopped and is unlikely to stop in the near future.Infectious disease experts and virologists urge the public to take precautions to protect the elderly and people with comorbidities from the deadly virus. They warn that even if most people may not show severe symptoms from Covid infection, the elderly and people with underlying conditions remain at high risk.“We saw elderly people requiring intensive care during the previous surge in April,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “It’s time to return to the basics—washing hands, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds—to save at-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic.Meanwhile, the National Public Health Laboratory said that an Omicron sub-variant of the coronavirus is responsible for the surge in new infections of late. According to the latest update issued by the laboratory, the Omicron variant has been found in all 42 swab samples in the whole genome sequencing.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe this approach could be instrumental in tracking the virus’s severity and properties.This time, however, the laboratory has not provided information about the specific Omicron sub-variant. \nAs the spread of cholera continues unabated, agencies under the Ministry of Health and Population have started discussions to explore the possibility of vaccinating the people in affected areas against the deadly disease.Officials said that health authorities concerned and aid agencies held several rounds of discussions about containing the ongoing spread of the highly contagious disease.“We have also held discussion with the officials of the World Health Organisation in Nepal about the possibility of inoculating the people in the cholera hit areas including Lalitpur,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have also planned to discuss the issue with experts from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and even death within a few hours if untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.At least 50 people from four districts—38 in Lalitpur, eight in Kailali, and two each in Kathmandu and Pyuthan districts—have contracted cholera so far this year. Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients.Public health experts said that detected cases of cholera infection could be just a tip of the iceberg, as most of the positive cases are being reported from the districts having active surveillance, including the three districts of the Kathmandu Valley and Kailali.Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Vaccines against the deadly disease were administered in Kapilvastu and Rautahat districts in the past after all efforts to contain the spread of the disease failed.Health officials concede that even if they have discussed the issue of inoculating people from the disease hit areas with anti cholera vaccine, it is easier said than done. They said that finding an anti-cholera vaccine is challenging, as production of the vaccine itself is very low. Moreover, the government has not allocated a budget for the programme.“We have also talked with representatives of the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI), which provides vaccines free of cost to Nepal,” Ghimire said. “But they told us that the chance of supplying vaccines in the near future is low. We have to prepare for cholera vaccination for next year.”Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Most of the water sources contaminated with deadly microbesOfficials at the Health Office, Lalitpur said that contamination of most of the sources of water—tap water, ground water, tanker water—is a main challenge to contain the spread of the cholera.“We have yet to check the quality of the jar water, which is widely used in offices, hotels and homes for drinking,” said Dr Bhuwan Paudel, chief of Health Office, Lalitpur. “But faecal coliform has been found in most of the samples of tap water, ground water and tanker water being used in Lalitpur.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, is found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.They say consumption of contaminated water not only can cause diarrhoeal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the risk of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.They stress that awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are crucial to protect people from water-borne diseases.A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment is required to contain the spread of infection, according to doctors.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to experts.The World Health Organisation has also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nAlthough the extent of coronavirus spread in communities remains unclear, neither health authorities nor the public see a need for more testing. But doctors and experts, including virologists and officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, say cases of coronavirus in the country are steadily ticking up.“We won’t know the situation in communities without testing,” said Dr Janak Koirala, an infectious disease expert. “But what is true is that the number of people suffering from fever, sore throat, body aches and common cold have risen of late and some might be due to Covid.”The World Health Organisation’s report on integrated influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance for week 31 report of 2024 shows SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 13.68 percent.Also the latest data of the National Public Health Laboratory indicates a sharp increase in cases. Out of 5,373 tests conducted since January, 341 came out positive for Covid. The test positivity rate is 6.3 percent, which is concerning, according to experts.“Precaution should be taken if the positivity rate exceeds five percent,” said Koirala. “But we don’t know the actual condition, as neither testing nor active case finding are being conducted.”Besides the surge in coronavirus cases, coinfection of multiple viruses including coronavirus has also been detected, according to the lab report.The report shows that swab samples of 11 people having influenza-like symptoms were found to have been infected with A(H1N1) also known as swine flu, and Covid. One sample was found to have co-infection of influenza B virus and Covid. Along with Covid, influenza positivity rate is also on an upward trend. The NPHL’s report shows that the overall influenza positivity rate is 17.1 percent, meaning that 17 out of every 100 samples tested positive for influenza viruses. Specifically, 713 people tested positive for swine flu, 47 for A(H3), also known as Hong Kong flu, and 223 for influenza B virus. Since the end of the second wave of Covid in 2021, health authorities across Nepal have stopped active case finding, including contact tracing and free testing. Hospitals now only conduct tests for those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for travel abroad or for seriously ill patients with respiratory conditions. Multiple doctors the Post spoke with said that the circulation of coronavirus has never stopped and will not stop in coming days either.Infectious disease experts and virologists urge the public to take precautions to protect the elderly and people with comorbidity from the deadly virus. “Testing and other preventive measures have stopped,” an official at the Health Ministry said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak on the issue. “But just look around: in our homes and neighbourhood, we can easily find cases of fever, common cold and people with other Covid-like symptoms.”Experts say that even if people are not getting severe from Covid infection, the elderly and people with underlying conditions remain at high risk.“We saw elderly people requiring intensive care during the previous surge in April,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “It’s time to return to basics—washing hands, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds—in order to save at-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”Experts say the overall high positivity rate suggests the virus has spread faster than expected. There could be many people with Covid who have not gone for tests, according to them.As the coronavirus symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu, many opt not to get tested, which doctors say could prove costly, because they can be carriers and could spread the virus to those coming in contact.Doctors warn that authorities’ reactive approach—taking preventive measures only after hospitals start witnessing massive patient flow could result in more severe consequences.Meanwhile, a highly placed source at the Health Ministry confirmed detection of a new sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country apart from previous variants including the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4.The National Public Health Laboratory had recently carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of 42 coronavirus-infected persons. The report is expected to be published on Tuesday.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus’s severity and properties.“The trend of previous years shows infection of influenza virus including coronavirus surge in August and September,” said Dr Ranjan Bhatta, director at the NPHL. “This surge has been seen in recent days as well. But this does not mean you should panic, only that you should take enough precautions against the risk.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nA late goal by new signing Joshua Zirkzee earned Manchester United a nervy 1-0 victory over Fulham in their Premier League season opener at Old Trafford on Friday.Home supporters were in buoyant mood ahead of the first game of the English top-flight campaign, with four players unveiled on the pitch and new faces in the United boardroom also in attendance.Just as they did at home for much of last season, however, United struggled to break down their opponents in the first half, with captain Bruno Fernandes going closest to scoring the opener.Frustrations grew after the break, only for Dutch substitute Zirkzee to arrive right on cue three minutes from time to earn United victory.“To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn’t be better,” Zirkzee told Sky Sports.“Manchester United is a huge club. You should always strive for the best. It's all good vibes.”A smart save from goalkeeper Andre Onana kept an early curling Kenny Tete effort out while Fernandes was presented with two golden opportunities but was denied by Fulham keeper Bernd Leno.Midfielder Mason Mount handed a starting spot after an injury-ravaged first season in Manchester, went close early in the second half.More wayward passing led to groans from supporters, however, before despair turned to jubilation at the death when substitutes Alejandro Garnacho and Zirkzee combined to create the winner.United have more wins and more points from their opening games of Premier League campaigns than any other team, but this performance suggested there is still much to be done for manager Erik ten Hag.Without a Premier League title since 2013 and having addressed key problem areas in the transfer market, United supporters are expecting better than their eighth-placed finish last term. \nEverest Women’s Volleyball League on Friday announced the players and coaches of the all participating six teams for the inaugural season of its tournament.Gandaki, Kathmandu, Madhesh, Lalitpur, Karnali and Chitwan will compete in the tournament.The marquee players of the team were unveiled last week. National team captain Aruna Shahi will represent Chitwan. Other marquee players Saraswati Chaudhary, Salina Shrestha, Niruta Thagunna, Usha Bhandari and Sumitra Regmi will be competing for Gandaki, Lalitpur, Madhesh, Kathmandu and Karnali, respectively.The players have been classified into three tiers, with each team featuring one “A” grade player, four “B” grade players, and three “C” grade players. The teams are permitted to sign a minimum of three foreign players each, while one player will be selected through a talent hunt.Jagadish Bhatta, the coach of the national women’s volleyball team who recently guided Nepal to a historic victory over India at the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League, will be at the helm of Team Kathmandu. \nAll Nepal Football Association (ANFA) on Friday shifted the group stage fixtures of the SAFF U-20 Championship football tournament to the ANFA Complex in Satdobato due to poor condition of the Dasharath Stadium. The championship is set to begin on Sunday.The country’s football governing body decided to change the venue of the tournament after SAFF match commissioner Abdul Hameed Abdul Ghafoor, after an inspection, deemed the Dasharath Stadium unfit to host matches.The Dasharath Stadium was originally scheduled to host all SAFF matches. “The match commissioner inspected the football grounds at both the Dasharath Stadium and ANFA Complex on Friday. After the inspection he told us that Dasharath Stadium is unprepared for hosting the SAFF championship,” ANFA Spokesperson Suresh Shah told the Post.Abdul Ghafoor, a Maldives national, arrived in Kathmandu on Thursday evening.ANFA released the fixtures of the Championship, rescheduling all the group fixtures at the ANFA Complex. The semi-finals and finals of the Championship will be held at the Dasharath Stadium, ANFA said in a statement later in the evening.Nepal will face Sri Lanka to kick off the SAFF U-20 on Sunday.The poor management of pitch of the country’s only international-standard football stadium drew public criticism on Tuesday when Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda’s Paro FC and Martyrs Memorial A-Division League champions Church Boys United played their AFC Challenge League qualification playoff match in a muddy and puddled pitch, following an afternoon rainfall.The stadium was hosting Paro only days after the Asian Football Confederation found the ground good enough to host international matches.ANFA Vice President Deepak Khatiwada on Wednesday insisted that the responsibility to maintain the Dasharath Stadium’s ground should return to ANFA, further stressing that no games other than football should be organised there.The Council took over the responsibility of the ground after Nepal was forced to move their second round matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers to neutral venues in March, after the AFC representatives deemed the ground condition unsatisfactory.The stadium is also scheduled to host SAFF Women’s Championship 2024 in October. \nIndian medical professionals started a 24-hour shutdown of non-emergency services across the country on Saturday in protest against the brutal rape and murder of a doctor in the eastern city of Kolkata.The shutdown, which began at 6 am, will cut off access to elective medical procedures and out-patient consultations in the world’s most populous nation, according to a statement by the Indian Medical Association.Casualty departments at hospitals, which deal with emergencies, will continue to be staffed.A 31-year-old trainee doctor was raped and murdered last week inside a medical college in Kolkata where she worked, triggering nationwide protests among doctors and drawing parallels to the notorious gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012.Anger at the failure of tough laws to deter a rising tide of violence against women has fuelled protests by doctors and women’s groups.“Women form the majority of our profession in this country. Time and again, we have asked for safety for them,” IMA President R. V. Asokan told Reuters on Friday.More than a million medics were expected to join the strike. \nDucking as mortar fire exploded around them, Rohingya refugee Mustafa Kamal and his family narrowly escaped the attack by a rebel militia on their town in western Myanmar.Crowds had gathered on a small island to seek shelter after witnessing killings in the coastal town of Maungdaw, he said, but “many died on the spot”, including one of his nephews, Noor Sadek.Others crawled and swam to reach neighbouring Bangladesh, he said.His family are among many Rohingya, members of a persecuted mostly Muslim minority, who fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state in recent days, as fighting escalates between the troops of the ruling junta and the Arakan Army, the powerful ethnic militia that recruits from the Buddhist majority.Reuters was not able to determine how many Rohingya had crossed into Bangladesh, where close to a million Rohingya live in refugee camps outside the coastal town of Cox’s Bazar.But medical charity Medicines Sans Frontières said its doctors had treated 54 people for violence-related injuries in recent days, 40 per cent of them women and children.“We were seeing lots of gunshots, shrapnel, mortar shell injuries, all indicative of indiscriminate,” Orla Murphy, the group’s Bangladesh representative, told Reuters. “They were life-threatening trauma wounds that we were treating.”The influx of refugees, who will have to stay with relatives, stretching resources, will make food supplies scarce, said the representative of a panel of displaced Rohingya.“They are suffering from an extreme food crisis,” added Kamal Hossain, chairman of the panel. “The government and camp authorities should arrange their food.”Many dozens of Rohingya, including a heavily pregnant woman and her two-year-old daughter, were killed last week in drone attacks in Maungdaw that three witnesses said were carried out by the Arakan Army, Reuters reported.The rebel group and the junta blamed one another for the attack. Several boats carrying refugees to Bangladesh were sunk, killing more, Bangladesh media said.The latest wave of attacks, including the burning of a Rohingya town by the Arakan Army in May, is the biggest surge in violence against the Rohingya since a 2017 Myanmar military-led campaign that the United Nations said was carried out with genocidal intent forced more than 730,000 to flee to Bangladesh.‘FIGHTING FOR LIFE’Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, a Bangladesh refugee relief official based in Cox’s Bazar, said Rohingya had been seeking safety in increased numbers since the drone attack but did not say how many had crossed the border.“I have heard that many dead bodies are floating across to Bangladesh and a humanitarian crisis has occurred across the shore in Maungdaw,” he said.Bangladesh is in no position to accept more Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, the South Asian nation’s de-facto foreign minister, Mohammad Touhid Hossain, told Reuters on Thursday, asking neighbouring India and other countries to do more.Hossain also called for more international pressure on the Arakan Army to stop the attacks on the Rohingya in Rakhine state.“But when someone arrives with a bullet injury, fighting for life, or a pregnant woman arrives fighting for life, we are not that inhuman that we will turn them away,” Bangladesh’s Rahman said.The United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, said it did not have information on the number of Rohingya who had crossed into Bangladesh.Another man who fled his home with his young family, Mohammed Saber, said about 60 people were killed in his village when the Arakan Army raided it, among them his two-year-old nephew, Mujibul Hasan.They paid traffickers to take them by boat to Bangladesh but the ship came under attack, which killed dozens aboard, he said.The family is now sheltering with an uncle, but Saber has no money. He needs to buy medicine for his children.“I will do whatever it takes to keep my family alive,” he said. \nNegotiators were to meet in Qatar again on Friday seeking a Gaza ceasefire agreement that could help avert regional escalation, end a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, and free Israeli hostages held by Hamas.The latest round of talks between Israel and mediators began on Thursday and was expected to resume on Friday after noon prayers. Mediators have said they are briefing Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is not taking direct part in the talks, on developments.“This is vital work. The remaining obstacles can be overcome, and we must bring this process to a close,” U.S. national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House.Months of on-off talks have so far failed to overcome fundamental divisions, with Israel saying peace will only be possible if Hamas is destroyed, and Hamas saying it will only accept a permanent, rather than temporary, ceasefire.Overnight, Israeli forces pounded targets across tiny, crowded Gaza and issued new orders for people to leave areas it had previously designated as civilian safe zones, saying Hamas had used them to fire mortars and rockets at Israel.The conflict began on Oct. 7 when Hamas fighters rampaged into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and seizing around 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has reduced much of the territory to rubble and killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israel says it has eliminated 17,000 Hamas fighters.REGIONAL FEARSIn a statement late on Thursday, Hamas politburo member Hossam Badran said Israel’s continuing operations were an obstacle to progress on a ceasefire.The Israeli delegation includes spy chief David Barnea, head of the domestic security service Ronen Bar and the military’s hostages chief Nitzan Alon, defence officials said.The White House sent CIA Director Bill Burns and U.S. Middle East envoy Brett McGurk. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egypt’s intelligence chief Abbas Kamel are also taking part.The negotiations are taking place in the shadow of a feared regional escalation, with Iran threatening to retaliate against Israel after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31.With U.S. warships, submarines and warplanes dispatched to the region to defend Israel and deter potential attackers, Washington hopes a ceasefire agreement in Gaza can defuse the risk of a wider war.Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday he had told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during their last meeting in July to quickly end the Gaza war, but the former president also criticized ceasefire demands.“He knows what he’s doing, I did encourage him to get this over with,” Trump told reporters at a press conference on Thursday. “It has to get over with fast. ... Get your victory and get it over with. It has to stop, the killing has to stop.”Netanyahu’s office and Trump both separately denied on Thursday an Axios report that said they had spoken the previous day about Gaza ceasefire and hostage release talks.The White House meanwhile said attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian civilians in the West Bank were “unacceptable and must stop” after dozens of settlers assaulted a village, killing at least one person. \nAn association of Indian doctors called for more than a million colleagues nationwide to provide only essential services on Saturday, in a protest over the brutal rape and murder of a medic that is set to be the biggest such strike in recent times.Anger over the crime showed no signs of dying down a week after the 31-year-old doctor was found dead on a blood-soaked mattress in the medical college where she worked in the eastern city of Kolkata.She had settled down for a short nap on a carpet in a college lecture hall after working for nearly 20 hours of a 36-hour shift, staff at the R G Kar Medical College told Reuters.Anger at the failure of tough laws to deter a rising tide of violence against women has fuelled protests by doctors and women’s groups.“The emotions are different this time,” R V Asokan, the president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the largest grouping of practitioners, with 400,000 members, told Reuters.“Women form the majority of our profession in this country. Time and again, we have asked for safety for them.”Late on Thursday, the IMA called on practising doctors in India, a figure it estimates to exceed a million, to shut down all services nationwide, except emergency departments, for 24 hours from Saturday morning.Political parties, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in the opposition in the state of West Bengal, whose capital is Kolkata, said they would hold protests in the city on Friday.Bollywood actors, other celebrities and politicians have voiced shock at the crime, calling for stricter punishment for perpetrators.A low-earning police volunteer, designated to help local police officers and their families who needed to be admitted to the hospital, has been arrested and charged with the crime, but protesters say that is not enough.Doctors say the circumstances of the rape highlight the vulnerability of medics left without proper protection and facilities.Tougher sentences were among sweeping changes made to the criminal justice system after the 2012 gang-rape of a 23-year-old student in a moving bus that sparked similar protests and outrage, but campaigners say little has changed since.The health ministry issued guidelines on Friday setting a six-hour deadline for the heads of state-run hospitals and medical colleges to report incidents of violence against health care workers. \nIn 1932, Juddha Shumsher Rana built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, which housed diverse animals from Nepal and abroad, including tigers, rhinos, deer, monkeys, birds, and possibly a lion.\nUnauthorised translations of popular books, including those by Taslima Nasrin, are rampant in Nepal, despite copyright laws prohibiting such practices, leading to poor quality translations and harm to authors and readers.\nOne of the first group experiments of Nepal Studies in the mid-20th century came in the form of a research collective which was later named Samsodhan Mandal. It was founded and led by the late Naya Raj Pant (1913-2002). Pant had studied Siddhant Jyautisa (astronomy) with Padmakar Dvivedi and others in Banaras for about six years during the 1930s. A key text that had greatly influenced him during this period was Bhaskara’s Siddhantasiromani, a 12th-century text. Dvivedi was interested in ancient history and tried to inculcate that interest in his pupils as well. According to Pant, he used to meet with his guru outside of school hours to learn history and other things. From the mid-1930s, Pant started studying the history of Nepal. After returning to Kathmandu in 1938, he came into contact with Baburam Acharya (1888-1972) who gave him old documents to study. Later he came into contact with Sardar Rudra Raj Pandey (1901-1987) who facilitated a six-month research stint for him in the Guthi Office.Pant writes, “From all these [interests and connections], I learnt a bit about Nepali history. When I found mutually contradictory statements [stories] in the history written by foreigners, I began to lose my respect for them. I [then] decided to progressively revise the history of Nepal.” In 1941, Pant was hired by the Ranipokhari Sanskrit Pathashala to teach Jyautisa. From around the same time, he is said to have immersed himself in the further study of Sanskrit grammar and Kautilya’s Arthasastra. Starting from the early 1940s, Pant started a private Pathashala in Kathmandu to train students in Sanskrit, Jyautisa and history. What was his vision then? In Hamro Uddesya ra Karyapranali, a text said to have been written around 1957 but published only in 2002, Pant wrote, “A century has passed since we started taking English-style education. We know first-hand that we have been (mostly) unable to learn work-effective knowledge, or when we have managed to do so, it has not succeeded in our country and produced good results. Now is not the time to remain idle. There is no other way but to rejuvenate our own ancient knowledge. Even though it might require great perseverance and a lot of time, we have to do research on our knowledge and advance it further; we have to maintain our own traditional experiences, and find our own path/method. Only if we manage to do this will we be independently able to make our country more prosperous....It is with this belief that we are engaged in studying-teaching Sanskrit education to rejuvenate our knowledge. The Sanskrit Pathashala has been opened for this purpose.”Just as one founder of the Nepal Sanskritik Parisad (estd 1951) had highlighted the need to cultivate self-identity to shed the cultural dependency on Europe, Pant stressed the need to rejuvenate traditional Sanskrit education as the highway for Nepal’s prosperity. Regarding the particular modality of his Pathashala, in an article published in 2014, historian Yogesh Raj has suggested that Pant had been “impressed by the strict Gurukul-style teachings of an obscure Pandit Genalal Chaudhary” whom he had encountered in Banaras.Pant’s Pathashala adhered to some fundamentals as integral to the process of training as a historian. These included mastery of Sanskrit, palaeography and epigraphy, rote memorisation of some key texts, and rectification of factual errors committed by other historians based on source criticism. When enrolling at the Pathashala, the students had to pledge that they would not use it as a ladder to subsequent education in foreign languages. The guardians of the students also had to sign another piece of paper saying, “From the bottom of my heart, I believe that great knowledge can be attained and livelihood earned even when one does not study English or other foreign languages.”In Pant’s Pathashala, mastery over Sanskrit was given great priority. In the words of his son and disciple Mahes Raj Pant, this enabled the students “to have independent access to many a discipline from the whole range of Sanskrit literature.” Rote learning as part of the ‘traditional method’ was a fundamental tenet of the senior Pant’s training while he was a student, and he replicated this method in his own Pathashala. Recitation of specific texts from memory was how gradual competence was demonstrated in this school. Being able to critically edit old documents and texts of inscriptions and write commentaries on them was another part of the training. The projected time-period to master the skills emphasised in this school was a total of eight years.Following the guru’s command, the students in Pant’s Pathashala mostly invested their academic energies into doing research on the history of Nepal. This work began to thrive after the Rana regime ended in 1951. Its members started to publish pamphlets of Itihas-samsodhan (Amendments of History) from 1952. In the words of Mahes Raj Pant, “In those pamphlets the students pointed out with documentary evidence the errors committed by the so-called scholars in dealing with the history of Nepal. That work of the group attracted a lot of popular attention at the time. Some of the Ithihasa-Samsodhana pamphlets contained harsh words to shock those who were incompetent to write the history of Nepal….The task of the group helped to highlight various aspects of Nepalese history and gave a fresh impetus to the reconstruction of a correct and complete history of Nepal.” In these pamphlets, Mandal students deployed what Raj has called “multi-layer source criticism.” Their “rule of evidence” was “primarily about sustained engagement with the fidelity of evidence and often solely that.” At its largest, the Mandal’s Pathashala had 32 students out of which 21 were involved in the history samsodhan work. However, by the time the Samsodhan Mandal got officially registered in the early 1960s, only ten, including the guru, remained. One member of the group, Gyanmani Nepal (1933-2024), had already graduated by then and returned to his home in eastern Nepal to start a similar Pathashala. Several others had quit the group for various reasons.By the end of the 1960s, the Mandal’s scholars had generated a corpus of booklets including several dozen ‘Amendments of History’. A consolidated and revised collection of 50 such ‘Amendments’ was published in 1962. They had also published a series of Shavadhan-patras, challenging the published work of various scholars and cautioning them against unethical academic practices such as not acknowledging the published work of the Mandal scholars. They had also published several volumes of primary documents, including 12 issues of the quarterly Abhilekh-sangraha, some critically edited historical texts, and over 20 issues of its quarterly journal Purnima (estd 1964). By 1970, the Pathashala had trained individuals such as Dhanavajra Vajracharya (1932-1994), Gyanmani Nepal, the late Shankar Man Rajbanshi, Gautamvajra Vajracharya, Mahes Raj Pant, and several others as historians. Several members of this Pathashala went on to make significant contributions in history-writing of Nepal. They provided us with a relatively secure knowledge of the chronology of the successive ruling dynasties of Nepal from the Licchavi period to the Shah dynasty, made public various types of new historical documents and other sources and set exacting standards for evidence-based history-writing. The main bulk of their contributions fell under the domain of political history, but some of them also made significant contributions to a broader social history. Articles in the essay form and length were the preferred outputs of the members of this school, and interpretive historical narrative of the monograph length was not their strongest mode of written output. Writing in 1984, one of Mandal’s members, Mahes Raj Pant, stated, “The greatest contribution of this group was that it inspired the natives with the idea that given proper education, we can carry on research, and we ourselves are competent enough to reconstruct our past.” In the assessment of Yogesh Raj, the work of the Mandal contributed to “epistemic diversity” in historical knowledge production in post-Rana Nepal. Raj adds, “Mandal scholars took evidence as resources whose rigorous criticism would lead to a true and ‘scientific’ knowledge about the past.” Samsodhan Mandal’s Pathashala was plagued by financial problems from its very beginning. After an initial phase of great activity in the 1950s and 60s, it could not find the means to retain its students and reproduce itself in intergenerational terms. By the time of the death of its initiator, Naya Raj Pant, in November 2002, the school had been reduced to the guru and his two historian sons, Mahes Raj and Dines Raj Pant. While talking to a journalist in the immediate aftermath of the demise of the senior Pant, his two sons described their father’s attempt at an alternative to formal university-based education and degrees as a “failure”. The senior Pant and his sons have often said that, among other reasons, the antagonism of those whose work had been amended by the Mandal’s students led to the downfall of its Pathashala. In their view, given that those who were ‘attacked’ in its pamphlets were powerful members of Nepal’s intellectual elite, the latter conspired to disband the Pathashala. While there is no doubt that those whose works were ‘amended’ were mostly not pleased to have been put under the Mandal’s scanner, the idea of them getting together to conspire against the Pathashala’s institutional longevity is a bit hard to digest. The Pathashala initially succeeded because the pupils mostly adhered to the utopian visions of the guru Naya Raj Pant and participated in his experiment as his disciples. However, as they gradually became expert historians in their own right and had to earn a living to support their families, discordance between the fiscal needs of the pupils and the school’s inability to generate an income to keep it running became all too apparent. The school never had a system whereby the pupils were expected to pay regular fees to take lessons. In the early decades, the guru supported his family with his salary from the Ranipokhari Sanskrit Pathashala, and its scholars occasionally got some stipend from various sources (including Nepal Sanskritik Parisad) to critically edit historical texts. As part of their remit as trainees, the older students also tutored the younger ones in the Pathashala. Following the establishment of Tribhuvan University in 1959, university-credentialed individuals began to find jobs in new state, para-state and private institutions. By the early 1970s, the intergenerational transfer of knowledge began to be mediated by more complex institutions supported by the state and market forces. Hence, the Mandal’s Pathashala model and the vision of which it was a part, began to look less attractive to those who were already its members and to younger folks who were its potential members. When the late Dhanavajra Vajracharya, one of the Mandal’s most competent and committed members, quit it and joined TU in 1971, the attraction of this Pathashala was surely on the decline.  In the context of the immediate post-Rana Nepal, the experiment that was Samsodhan Mandal Pathashala was important because it established a firm tradition of Nepali historical scholarship based on a critical reading of the evidence. This school demonstrated what could be achieved through a commitment to a kind of historical scholarship that had been in practice in scholarly traditions in different parts of the world until the mid-20th century but mostly absent in Nepal. We should also note that the Pathashala was a home-grown effort that relied on the collaboration of several individuals for its success and for at least a few decades, its work provided one model of how Nepal Studies could be done in Nepal.  \nState intervention has made a comeback. States have, in one way or another, always intervened in markets to develop specific industries and push innovation. But there has been a renaissance since the 2010s, in particular with respect to industrial and trade policy.There are many reasons for this. The fallout from the global financial crisis in 2007–08, increasing geopolitical tensions, and efforts to strengthen domestic manufacturing in the wake of supply chain disruptions are a few of the leading factors.Alongside the comeback of state intervention, experts are chiming in on what state-led growth strategies should look like. They highlight different things, but one piece of advice is recurring: These strategies need to incentivise exports and shy away from protectionism.Governments are right to focus on exports. But the story about protectionism is more complicated. In fact, in most cases of successful industrial and trade policy, a push for exports has been combined with elements of protectionism.South Korea and Taiwan are good examples. These countries transformed their economies from low-income to high-income at lightning speed, needing only 30 years to do so (from roughly 1960 to 1990).They achieved this feat through meticulously crafted policies, and export-orientation was a key feature. In a speech in 1965, the South Korean president, Park Chung-hee, called exports “the economic lifeline” of the country. But protectionism was equally important.Emergency tariffs were often imposed on items with excessively high import growth. In addition to this relatively visible measure, a range of “covert” protectionist measures were used. For example, a number of special laws on most imports almost invariably meant that import permission had to be obtained from a public agency.An array of taxes not specified as tariffs were also often imposed when attempts were made to import non-essential items such as golf clubs, whisky and French wine. They were frequently labelled as an education tax, a defence tax, or simply a “special” tax.In Taiwan, protectionist policies featured more explicitly than in South Korea. In the mid-1970s, almost half of the items in the tariff schedule still carried import tax rates of over 40 percent.And, like in South Korea, Taiwan applied a range of non-tariff barriers. These included the tying of import licences to export performance, restrictions on which countries imports could come from and who could import them, and “approval” mechanisms for import control.The latter essentially meant that, for firms wishing to import certain products, a reference check had to be made to make sure that domestic suppliers could not meet the would-be importer on price, quality and delivery.A path well litBy using protectionist measures to avoid excessive import growth and shield domestic firms from competition, South Korea and Taiwan were not doing something supremely novel.In fact, the most protectionist country throughout history is the US. It had the world’s highest average tariff rates on imported manufactures throughout the 1800s, a period that saw the country transform into a global economic powerhouse.China in the 1990s and 2000s is another prime example of incorporating protectionism into the design of industrial and trade policy. However, it was a form of protectionism that looked slightly different.China relied heavily on attracting foreign investment into manufacturing, which was done strategically by nudging multinationals to form joint ventures with Chinese state-owned enterprises. This increased the probability of technology transfer and, in time, of replacing imported products with those produced in China.Overall, China’s state-led industrialisation strategy has been hugely successful. Practically all manufactured products today can somehow be traced to a production process in China, and the country dominates many global industries.While protectionism may be essential to successful economic development, a few issues still need to be addressed.First, protectionist measures like tariffs have no guarantee of being successful. The 1950s and 1960s, for example, saw governments across Africa and Latin America protect domestic firms from outside competition. The intention was to develop a domestic industrial base, but the firms largely failed to become competitive on the world market.That said, export subsidies (and state intervention more broadly) have no guarantee of working either. Does this mean we should ditch all state intervention? Of course it doesn’t. All state intervention—including protectionism—can fail, but without any state intervention failure is a guarantee.One way to think about the practice of industrial and trade policy is that it’s like venture capital: All policies should be evaluated like a portfolio, within which a small number of successful bets will pay for all the failures.Second, can all countries be protectionist at the same time? Probably not, and this is why people worry about trade wars. In fact, we are seeing this unfold at the moment between China and the US.In a world where nation states can retaliate against one another with things like tariffs, and as long as economic competition between firms and nation states remains a central part of how the global economy is organised, the playing field for economic competition needs to be made level.Right now, it isn’t level. It vastly favours the wealthiest and most powerful countries, and the multinational corporations based within them.This is why, in international trade agreements, lower-income countries should be allowed more space in their design of economic development policy—including, but not limited to, protectionist policies.Simply put, countries that are lagging technologically should be granted a larger policy toolbox. This would give lower-income countries a better chance of catching up with high-income countries. And if we are to take one lesson from economic history in this respect, it’s that protectionist policies have been vital for catching up.Hauge is assistant professor in Development Studies at the University of Cambridge.-The ConversationRead the original article here. \nWith the Paris 2024 Olympics concluding earlier this week, Nepali players have returned home. All seven athletes returned empty handed, having failed to break the 60-year spell of participating in Olympics without winning a medal. Those scratching their heads as to why Nepal has had a dry run all these decades needn’t look further than the Dasharath Stadium, located at the nerve centre of Kathmandu. The country’s most famous stadium was a sight to see on Tuesday. Nepal’s Church Boys United lost to Bhutan’s Paro FC, which was a shock for Nepali fans. But the match result was hardly a topic of discussion on Tuesday evening. Rather, it was the ground of the country’s only international-standard stadium hosting an international match. It was a messy affair on the ground as the 22 boys jostled for the ball, slipping on the puddled, muddy ground all the time. As the Nepali players struggled to clinch a win against the visiting team, the photographs circulating on social and mainstream media, of the players drenched in sludge, gave an early indication that Nepal was set to lose an image war internationally. The Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda, a member of the Bhutan squad, was right on point when he called the Bhadrakali ground a joke. It’s not clear whether Nepali authorities have taken Honda’s remark as an insult to Nepal or ignored it completely, but Honda, who has played three world cups for Japan, should be thanked for pointing out our pathetic state. The tamasha at the stadium exposed the state of our sports infrastructure and the insincerity of our authorities even when it comes to organising an international event.Alarmingly, the situation is no different in cricket, volleyball or martial arts. Nepali youths have tremendous interest and potential in sports, in addition to a fan base envied by the world. Impressed by our young talents, the international sports fraternity has shown unprecedented interest towards Nepal in recent years. But the authorities remain as lethargic as ever even to cash in on the international goodwill.There is no dearth of literature on the lackadaisical attitude of Nepali sports authorities. But there are some basics they should do immediately if Nepali sports is to get any better. First, the authorities must work to strengthen the financial security of the players. Only then we can expect better results from them. If the sportspeople are playing for the country, it is the country that should look after their needs. The prime ministers, ministers and other officials who compete to make big announcements after a Nepali team’s win in an international match should learn to walk the talk.Second, the authorities should work immediately to improve sports infrastructure. If the Dasharath Stadium is muddy, the Kirtipur Cricket Ground has no light. The Mulpani Cricket Stadium has taken decades to complete, and there are hardly any decent stadiums outside the capital city, and players are deprived of training and international exposure. The authorities must therefore ensure that the sports bodies strictly follow a calendar of events throughout the year from federal to the grassroots level to ensure a holistic development of the sector. If we continue to make the players dodge the sludge on their training ground, we cannot expect them to return home with international medals.  \nIndia’s new foreign secretary Vikram Misri returned to New Delhi on Monday after a 32-hour whirlwind tour around Kathmandu. Not much was expected of the visit, as it was supposed to be a courtesy call, a continuation of the tradition of Indian foreign secretaries visiting neighbouring countries after their appointment. So there were no significant breakthroughs in outstanding issues—just an exchange of pleasantries and congratulations over chiya-kaffee. A rendezvous with no agenda is a good thing once in a while—after all, neighbours can’t just engage in geopolitical hard talk all the time. However, here’s wishing the visiting dignitary had some time to step out of the prime ministerial and presidential chambers onto the streets. For the monsoon-battered, puddled roads reflect reality better than the glossy floors of Baluwatar and Sheetal Niwas. Having recently seen a diplomatic whodunnit in Bangladesh, Indian Babus would certainly want to touch base with ground reality in the neighbourhood.Nepal and Bangladesh have different political contexts, including in terms of parliamentary politics. Having faced Sheikh Hasina's seemingly tight grip on state affairs for over a decade and a half, Bangladeshis were fidgeting for a change as democracy was on the wane. With 13 government changes in 16 years, Nepal remains committed to democracy although Nepalis are looking for a change, seeking stability. India remained tight-lipped on the goings-on in Bangladesh even as Hasina sought a fourth consecutive term this January by keeping opposition leaders behind bars. Apart from being the biggest trade partner in South Asia, Bangladesh was a “friendly” nation to India, thanks to Hasina’s indebtedness to India from 1971 all the way to 2024. As long as the person of its liking was in power in Dhaka, India chose to remain silent to the calls for democracy, free press and fair elections in Bangladesh, only to jolt back to reality when the tide of change swept Hasina off her feet, and the comfort of dealing with a friendly ruler in the neighbourhood became a thing of the past.Luckily for Misri, things are not too bad in Nepal. But when was the last time a top Indian diplomat spoke about the report of the Eminent Persons Group that is collecting dust due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reluctance to so much as acknowledge it? When will India acknowledge Bhairahawa Airport as Nepal’s major development infrastructure and provide the air space for it to operate fully? And when will the Babus in New Delhi’s North Block stop using the language of Nepal, a supposed backyard of India, being taken over by China? When Misri returns to Nepal for a definitive diplomatic visit, he would want to come up with some fresh ideas and spend a bit more time to understand the subterranean tides of change. Nepal might have been ruled by old leaders milking their legacy of the 1990s politics when Misri was still a young foreign services officer in India, but the old Indian lenses used to look at Nepal now need replacing.  \nIt’s not a good sign for people to start questioning a government’s anti-corruption credentials barely a month after its formation. Yet they have choice but to do so with the government seemingly intent on giving a free pass to many corrupt officials and leaders. As per a bill currently under discussion in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of Parliament, a corruption case should be filed within five years of the knowledge of such an instance of corruption. (It is unclear who should have such knowledge.) Similarly, if an individual had been involved in corruption while being in a public position and could not be punished at the time, they too should be punished within five years of retirement. In fact, the bill was first registered by the then KP Sharma Oli government on January 20, 2020. It was passed and sent to Parliament on April 10, 2023. With Oli back in power, the bill, which is supposed to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2059 (2002 AD) has now again come to the centrestage. The bill presented by the Oli government seems to have been inspired by a “forgive and forget” approach to corruption. It is so indefensible that even the MPs from the ruling parties are struggling to do it. Lawmakers of the opposition Maoist Centre and Rastriya Swatantra Party have also rightly pointed out that the deadline of five years is regressive. As it stands, the UML is the sole party in defense of the bill. If the other parties, both ruling and opposition, stick to their guns, the government will have to back down, and it should. For there is absolutely no rhyme or reason for the five-year cap; and were such a cap to be imposed, countless current and former politicians and bureaucrats who are soaked in corruption would walk scot-free. Nepal already ranks an alarming 108 of the 180 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2023—below fellow South Asian countries Bhutan (26th), the Maldives (93rd) and India (93rd). Moreover, the conviction rate in corruption cases in 2021-22 stood at just 38.5 percent. If there is one thing the government should do at this time, it is to bring policies to reduce corruption and punish the corrupt with due diligence. However, it seems to want to take the opposite route.From instances of money laundering to land grabbing, selling diplomatic passports to turning citizens into refugees, corruption is widespread in Nepal. No political party is free from corruption, which is also exemplified by recent investigations into high-level politicians in the Lalita Niwas land grab scam, the gold smuggling scams, and the Bhutanese refugee scam. There is ample evidence of how no corrupt country can steadily move forward on the path of peace and prosperity. This is why, fighting corruption should be the top agenda of all big and small political parties that purport to work in national interest. Those who don’t do so deserve to be singled out and punished for doing irreparable harm to their country.  \nThe luxurious new life of Pushpa Kamal Dahal is an antithesis of his younger days when he took up arms for the sake of the marginalised and downtrodden sections of society. As the leader of a bloody insurgency that claimed nearly 17,000 lives, Dahal has always had a legion of detractors. But when he first came out of the jungles to join mainstream politics, he also had a lot of public support, as was evident from the 220 seats his party won in the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The Maoist tally was double the number of the second-placed Nepali Congress, as the party got nearly 30 percent of all cast votes. By the time of the 2022 national elections, it had to be satisfied with 32 seats and just around 14 percent of the votes. The reason for this steady erosion in the party’s electoral support is clear enough. Primarily, it is a reflection of Dahal forgetting his roots. He is today no different to the ‘crony capitalists’ of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML he once blamed for all the country’s woes. There is now not a ‘progressive’ bone in his body. Yet following his ignominious exit as prime minister a month ago, Dahal has been in a hurry to put together a progressive alliance of socialist and left-learning forces. He is already in the four-party Socialist Front which, besides the Maoist Centre, also has as its members the CPN (Unified Socialist), the Nepal Socialist Party and the Communist Party of Nepal. The Maoist chief wants to further expand the collaboration between such like-minded forces. Moreover, his Maoist Centre party has announced a new nationwide campaign whereby it will go to people’s doorsteps to explain the party’s agendas and to get feedback. The feedback is likely to be angry. The party has long since abandoned its principled advocacy on behalf of women, Dalits, Janjatis and other marginalised communities—the groups that were its core voters. As things stand, on the right of the political centre in Nepal there is the Congress while the UML occupies the left of the centre. The people disenchanted with both these outfits are plumping for new forces like the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Janamat Party. Where in this political spectrum does today’s toothless Maoist party fit, one wonders. People won’t also be fooled by the formation of so-called leftist and socialist fronts. Dahal seems to remember his once core constituencies only when he is out of power. Disenchantment against him is growing, even within the Maoist Centre. After a long while, other party leaders are openly criticising his undisguised lust for power, most evident in his oscillation between the Congress and the UML just so he could occupy the prime minister’s chair. Some, like Narayan Kaji Shrestha and Janardan Sharma, have asked him to make way for a new leader. If Dahal is serious about reviving his party’s fortunes and leaving behind a credible legacy, he should be the one to make the biggest sacrifice. The options before him are limited. Gone are the days his gift of the gab alone could change people’s hearts and minds.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe weather on Saturday is forecast to be generally cloudy throughout the country.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of all provinces.Tonight the weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nBarely a month after exiting from the government, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third-largest party in the House of Representatives, has faced a power struggle between party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma.The conflict between a wartime Maoist commander Sharma and his “supreme leader” Dahal, which had been simmering for quite a while, surfaced at the party’s standing committee meeting that concluded on Thursday.Sharma not only spoke against Dahal but also presented a written document to the standing committee. At the meeting, Sharma asked Dahal to step down as party chairman. Dahal has led the party uninterruptedly for over three-and-a-half decades.At the end of the standing committee meeting, leaders had said that the differences between Dahal and Sharma were resolved. But that conclusion seems premature. The two were busy accusing and criticising each other at a public function in Kathmandu. Dahal had to pacify Sharma on Saturday as he complained of not being trusted by Dahal and other Maoist leaders. “When I was assigned to build an alliance with the CPN-UML, I worked for the same but was tagged as KP Oli’s man,” Sharma said at the function. Later, the Maoist Centre decided to ally with the Nepali Congress, and he worked for the same as directed by Dahal, Sharma claimed. “But I was dubbed Sher Bahadur Deuba’s man. When will I be called the Maoist party’s man? When will you call me Prachanda’s man?” said Sharma, pointing to Dahal, who was sitting at the same podium as the chief guest.Taken aback, Dahal seemed to be consoling Sharma saying that comrade Prabhakar [Sharma] would never split the party, contrary to some media reports.Dahal rubbished reports that Sharma was trying to split the party as baseless and that the days-long standing committee meeting had dispelled all rumours.The Maoist party chief and former prime minister, however, admitted that there were still some confusions and that the meeting had decided to look into the matter and make things clear and resolve them with joint effort.Soon after the party was out of the government, it called the meetings of the standing committee and the secretariat and discussed the Maoist CEntre's future course, including unity with other fringe parties, strengthening the Socialist Front, and building the party’s organisation.“There were some matters of serious suspicion and some still exist. And the meeting has decided to study and find how such a situation of suspicion emerged,” Dahal said. The Maoist leader promised to study the issue jointly with Sharma and, if needed, the party may form a probe committee.“We have reached an understanding to properly address the remaining concerns as well,” Dahal added.Sharma is not alone in demanding that Dahal handover the party’s reins.Even Maoist Centre senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha has asked Dahal to quit the leadership position. A large number of Maoist leaders at the central as well as lower committees want to see an overhaul of the party, said a central member.“If we fail to transform the party, there will be no hope for us besides surrendering to other parties in the 2027 elections,” the leader said.Another central committee member however doesn’t trust Dahal to build the party organisation. “Dahal would rather forge unity with other left parties and, if possible, explore options to contest the upcoming elections jointly with CPN-UML, the country’s largest communist party,” said the central member.The leader said he was unsure if the ruling UML would turn down Dahal’s proposal to join hands once again. According to him, Dahal’s strategy is to bring together left-leaning parties and put pressure on the UML, which leads the government with the backing of the Nepali Congress, to make an electoral alliance with the Maoists. The leader argues that the UML is preparing itself internally to contest the elections on its own, without allying with anyone.“This is the beginning of an infighting in the Maoist Centre because we abandoned the agenda of strengthening the federal, republican and secular Nepal,” said Ram Karki, secretary of the Maoist Centre. “This tussle is unlikely to stop anytime soon.”Because the conflict emerged under Dahal’s ‘schooling’, Karki claimed.He recalled that Mohan Baidya, who supported Dahal’s school of thought, engaged in a similar tussle before leaving the party. That conflict did not subside but intensified, leading Baidya to finally split the party, Karki observed.Later, Baburam Bhattarai, who also emerged allegedly from Dahal’s schooling, led a similar revolt, Karki recalled. “He also deserted the party. This time, too, the tussle has surfaced among those schooled under Dahal, so no one knows the outcome,” said Karki.For decades, Sharma remained a close confidant of Dahal. But he grew up to be a dissident after Dahal refused to appoint him the general secretary last year. Another deputy general secretary, Barsha Man Pun, was also an aspirant for the post of general secretary.Sharma and Pun are taken as Dahal’s lieutenants, right from the launch of the Maoist insurgency in 1996. Sidelining both during the 2022 party general convention, Dahal picked Dev Gurung, who had little influence in the party.Karki described the Congress-UML alliance’s move to oust the Maoist Centre from the government as a good opportunity to strengthen the Maoist party.“If the Nepali Congress and the UML hadn’t ejected our party from the government, we would have been finished by the time of next elections,” said Karki. “As we have been removed from power three years ahead of the election, there is some room for transformation.”Senior party leaders have given Dahal two options: transform himself and the party or vacate the chair that he has been occupying for over 35 years.Another central committee member said that if the conflict was an internal matter and the fight genuine, the party would emerge unscathed. “Otherwise, if external factors are working within the party, then the party will face a serious crisis,” said the leader.However, some Maoist leaders are confident that the party will not face a grave crisis. “Janardan ji questioned the party leadership. Isn’t that a good practice in the party?” said Yubaraj Chaulagain, a central committee member. “However, Chairman Dahal is addressing them.”Chaulagain said that the party leadership would collect reports from the party’s provincial committees and sister organisations and take the right decision based on them. “There’s the proposal for the party’s transformation. It will be discussed. We will gather more feedback and ideas from the lower committees, and follow them,” said Chaulagain. “Gradually, we will address the issues raised by Janardan ji.” \nGoat rearing has attracted farmers in Rolpa, a hill district in Nepal’s midwest. There are 59 households in Korchabang where most families have started commercial goat rearing.Lush forests, plants and trees and a good source of water make commercial goat rearing feasible in Rolpa, the heartland of the decade-long Maoist war that ended in 2006.In recent years, farmers have started growing different varieties of grasses in the villages too.Jokh Bahadur Gharti Magar, a farmer from Minahi, Korchabang, who is popular in the village for rearing many goats, said he is not worried about wild grass as he himself grows the varieties rich in nutrients on his farmland. He can also source fodder from the nearby forest.Magar, who runs a hotel in Minahi, is supported by his family for commercial goat keeping.“I started with a small investment. Later, my family helped me with more funds to increase the number of goats,” said Magar. The veterinary hospital in the district and the animal husbandry centre have also helped Magar and other farmers in their enterprise.The Smart Krishi Gaun programme run by the government for the past three years recognises Magar is one of the successful entrepreneurs. Magar is among high earners from goat rearing in Korchabang. As grass production is good in the area, farmers find the business highly profitable, said Bhim Prakash Pun, president of a farmers’ group.The government, through the veterinary hospital in Rolpa and the Livestock Service Centre, has implemented animal rearing programmes in the region. The Smart Krishi Gaun Programme Implementation Committee looks after agricultural affairs. Kaman Buda, a local politician, said rearing goats by building modern sheds is becoming more profitable.The farmers are rearing goats in better ways and have an income even in the rainy season. It is improving the economic situation, said Prasash Pun Magar, chairman of the Madi rural municipality ward 6. Among 59 farmers rearing goats, the annual incomes of 15 are good.Bhim Prakash Pun, who was in politics before taking up goat rearing, presides over the farmers’ group. He leads the Korchabang Smart Krishi Gaun Programme Implementation Committee.“Commercial goat rearing has become a major source of our income,” Pun said. The implementation of the Smart Krishi Programme and learning about modern ways of raising goats encouraged villagers to start the business. “So I started spending less time in politics and more in business.”The goat rearing initiative under the Smart Krishi Programme started in 2020. Farmers have been trained to cultivate grasses and manage sheds in modern ways.Pun has 20–25 goats, after selling 15 he-goats and 15 kids at once. The money goes to the education of children and household expenses.Around 15 to 20 households in Korchabang have started goat rearing as a major business.Technicians taught the farmers to build modern sheds. They also learnt grass cultivation and feed preparation, said Dr Shankar Neupane, chief of Veterinary and Animal Service Expert Centre. Training on financial transactions was also imparted.To make the 59 farmers entrepreneurs, the government has spent around Rs10.5 million, Neupane said. Jokh Bahadur Gharti Magar, a local farmer, said that the financial and technical support from the government was a big help for them.“From the hotel business, I came back to agriculture and livestock rearing,” Magar said. “After much thought, I took up goat farming by making a modern shed.”Gharti Magar, a former weightlifter, is happy as a farmer. He has 28 goats in the shed and has requested the provincial and federal governments to introduce additional programmes and provide another technician.Subha Bahadur Budhamagar, who also took to commercial goat rearing after a long teaching career, earns well.The government is doing proper inspection, said Matilal Kunwar, officer at Veterinary Hospital and Livestock Service Expert Center.Tirtha Raj Pun and Kaman Budha are rearing goats in Punthok and Jyang villages, respectively. Pun started with four goats and now has 10.Kaman Budha, who is also a trader, served villagers as a social worker. He rears 10–15 goats and takes them to Dang to sell. \nNepal will aim to win the trophy of the SAFF U-20 Championship for a third time when they begin their campaign of the biennial competition against Sri Lanka on Sunday.Nepal are drawn alongside Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Group A. Group B consists of three-time champions and holders India, the Maldives and Bhutan.The group stage matches will be held at the ANFA Complex in Satdobato due to poor condition of Dasharath Stadium’s pitch. All Nepal Football Association had decided to move the group matches to Satdobato citing “unprepared pitch at the Dasharath Stadium”. The decision came after SAFF match commissioner Abdul Hameed Abdul Ghafoor, after an inspection, deemed the Dasharath Stadium unfit to host matches.The poor management of pitch of the country’s only international-standard football stadium drew public criticism on Tuesday when Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda’s Paro FC and Martyrs Memorial A-Division League champions Church Boys United played their AFC Challenge League qualification playoff match in a muddy and puddled pitch, following an afternoon rainfall.ANFA has said that the semi-finals and final will be held back at the Dasharath Stadium’s ground, which is undergoing renovation.Nepal coach Urjan Shrestha said he aims to keep the trophy at home.“We have prepared well. We played practice matches against A-Division League champions Church Boys United and Tribhuvan Army Club. We will take full advantage of the home ground and try to win the trophy,” said Shrestha.However, Nepal will face a tough challenge from their closest rivals India, who have dominated the competition for the last five years, winning the trophy for the third consecutive time [2019 (SAFF U-18), 2022 (SAFF U-20), 2023 (SAFF U-19)].Nepal won the first edition defeating India in the final in 2015 (SAFF U-19) at home and defended the title in 2017 (SAFF U-18) in Bhutan.Only Nepal and India have won the SAFF Championship since its inception.India coach Ranjan Chaudhary said they are also aiming to defend the title for a third straight edition.“We are the defending champions and will play the game likewise. But we are focused on our first match,” said Chaudhary, who will open their defense of the title against Bhutan on Monday.Three-time runners up Bangladesh will also aim to dislodge India’s stranglehold and win their first trophy.Nepal U-20 squadGoalkeepers: Jiyarath Sheikh, Krishal Moktan, Bishal KC Defeneers: Simanta Thapa, Ashwin Ghorasaini, Bikram Tamang, Aayush Timsina, Madan Paudel, Ram Thapa, Samin Ghimiree, Ninsang Limbu Midfielders: Kushal Debua (captain), Avinash Syangtan, Jana Prakash Bam, Lachu Thapa, Saroj DarlamiForwards: Niraj Karki, Harish Raj Bhatta, Dharbendar Kunwar, Anil Bamjan, Samir Tamang, Nirajan Dhami, Rohan Khadgi \nUntil Wednesday, about a dozen-and-a-half activists huddled together in a dimly lit two-room shelter, sleeping on tarps with only thin bed sheets for cover. They relied on muddy water from a hand pump for hydration and used a roofless crumbling toilet.This group lived in a makeshift shelter at the Thapathali squatter settlement in Kathmandu, paying a monthly rent of Rs10,500.Among them was Nandakishor Ram Bibsh, a Chure conservation activist, who endured the harsh conditions for two months despite having a home and family back in Rautahat.“I’m not a squatter, yet the government forced us into this position,” Bibsh says. “Our suffering could have meant something if the government had listened, but all we got was silence.”The deafening silence forced them to reconsider their approach. On August 14, Bibsh and his fellow activists, who began their 25-day march from Saptari to Kathmandu on April 28, decided to leave the Thapathali camp.After over three months of sit-in amid harsh conditions, they returned to Janakpur, frustrated at the government’s continued inaction.Sunil Yadav, the central coordinator of the Chure conservation campaign, emphasises that their return is a start of the second phase of their protest. In their next move, the activists plan to raise public awareness by staging protests in every district of Madhesh before returning to the Capital with a bigger force by the end of August.On August 22, they even plan to hold large-scale demonstrations in front of the Madhesh chief minister’s residence.Yadav and his team aim to draw the government’s attention to the Chure range, a strip of geography running along Nepal’s east to west as the foothills above the plains that is devastated by over 30 years of deforestation, illegal mining and encroachment. This environmental damage has led to severe consequences like water shortages, landslides, soil erosion, and crop failures, impacting thousands who live there and down south.Equally appalling for the protesters is the government’s indifference. “We came to the Capital with empty buckets to symbolise the urgent need for water conservation. Those buckets got filled with our frustrations at the government’s indifference,” Yadav said.The poor living conditions during the march and protests have taken a toll on many activists’ health. Many had to travel back and forth between Madhesh Province and Kathmandu to manage personal affairs, health, and their responsibilities to the campaign.“It’s a shame that I had to leave my family and endure such hardships just to be heard,” Bibsh says. “We were driven to sleep on the streets and had to live in the squatter settlement. I don’t know how much more suffering the government needs to see.”On July 31, heavy rain flooded their residence in the squatter settlement in Thapathali, causing great distress among the activists. “Every time it rained, I was terrified that the roof might collapse,” says Sangita Sada, a 37-year-old from Lahan in Siraha district.During the protest, Sada frequently battled fever from the cold seeping through the floor and the harsh conditions. “I wasn’t the only one,” she says. “Almost all of us suffered from fever and cold multiple times.”Despite her illness, Sada forced herself to rise early each morning to fetch muddy water from the hand pump and cook for the group. She would then participate in the sit-in protests from 10 am to 6 pm before returning to the settlement to prepare dinner for the night.“We couldn’t afford jar water. We had no proper facilities for cooking, bathing, or toilets,” Sada adds.Elderly participants like 65-year-old Shanti Devi have endured even greater hardships. Devi, from Dhanusha, now suffers from chronic back pain as a result of the 25-day march. “I will have to use a walking cane forever”, said Devi.The activists have a 12-point list of demands. These include enacting a Chure Conservation Act, designating the Tarai as a dry zone, banning sand and stone mining in riverbeds, addressing pollution in the Sirsiya river, and stopping environmentally harmful construction projects. They also seek an investigation into forest workers involved with smugglers in illegal extraction activities.In 2014, the Nepal government declared the Chure an ‘Environmental Protection Area’ and established the President Chure-Tarai Madhesh Conservation Development Board (PCTMCDB) to oversee its conservation. However, research from November 2019 reveals that the board has struggled with its ad hoc approach and lacks a fully empowered office, integrated policies, and an independent conservation fund.Amidst the protest, Sada’s savings of Rs11,000 were spent on medicine and basic needs, while her husband struggled to support their family through his labour wages.Now, back home, Sada faces criticism from villagers for mingling with men and being away from her family. “As a woman participating in these protests, I face constant judgement, but I won’t give up,” she says. “Water is scarce, and I fear I won’t be able to provide my grandchildren even a glass of water.”In Madhesh, locals in districts like Bara and Rautahat now rely on water tankers due to declining water levels. Farmers are using water pumps and seeking alternative income sources, leading to the closure of many rice mills, according to Yadav.Upon arriving in Kathmandu, the activists first stayed at a small hotel but moved to the office of the Madhesi Nijamati Karmachari Manch due to financial constraints after one night. After 20 days, they were asked to leave the office. They then found accommodation in a squatter settlement with no other option.Struggling with rent and basic needs, they sought support from people in Madhesh and spent their meagre earnings. “Managing funds was tough, especially as many of us fell ill,” says Bibsh. Kiran Paudel, chairperson of the PCTMCDB, shares that he has sent the memorandum of campaigners’ demands to the Ministry of Forests and Environment.“We are planning on a Chure Conservation Act within the next three months and actions for river conservation,” Paudel says. “We are just a board—demands such as declaring the Tarai a dry zone, banning riverbed mining, and halting harmful construction projects are politically complex, requiring provincial and federal attention.”On August 5, the activists marked their 100th day of protest with a march from Maitighar to the prime minister’s residence in Baluwatar, aiming to draw the government’s attention.During this time, “we have suffered losses that have been too hard to swallow,” says Yadav.Elderly activist Nanda Mukhiya from Janakpur died on July 22, due to health complications worsened by the harsh living conditions during the march and protest. Despite his deteriorating health, Mukhiya had insisted on continuing the protest until he was forced to return home, where he died shortly thereafter.Bibsh argues that if the Khas Arya Pahadi community were affected by Chure destruction or staged a similar march, it would be a major national topic. “Madhesh issues are often overlooked in Nepal. We are rightful citizens, and the Chure issue affects the entire country,” he said.As they prepare for the second phase of their protest, the activists continue to fight for Chure’s future. The pressing question remains: how much longer will their voices be ignored, and what more must they endure to be heard?Sada worries that the next time they return to Kathmandu, they may not even secure space in a squatter settlement and might end up sleeping on the streets due to lack of funds. “How long should this continue?” she asks.“At Maitighar Mandala, I saw many give up, exhausted by the government apathy. Can it truly be called a government if it wears out its own people seeking justice? If we fail, whose failure is it—ours or the government’s?” \nI was invited to a literary programme organised by Srasta Samaj and Bhairav Puraskar Guthi on August 19, 2024, in Kathmandu. A note was appended to the invitation—Rochak Ghimire would turn 84 on that day and would be felicitated by a large group of writers and readers. Being very familiar with the literary contribution of Ghimire, this news unfolded a history of the literary times to me. Ghimire has made history as a publisher of the literary magazine Rachana, which started in 1961 when Nepal was on the cusp of an era that introduced several political and ideological challenges. The conspicuous response to the sensitivity of the times came from literary magazines. Roop-Rekha, a prominent literary magazine, came following hard on the heels of Panchayat, an autocratic system of government introduced by King Mahendra after dissolving people's elected parliament and jailing Prime Minister BP Koirala in 1960. I have drawn more examples of how literary magazines responded to such systems later in the article. Ghimire made a humble start, which was the best way to remain outside the influence of the nascent political system called Panchayat. He spent Rs500 to publish 300 copies at that time. I remember writing a long survey and analysis of the 100 issues of Rachana, which was published in the magazine in 2008. Remarkably, the literary magazine continues to this date and brings together cohorts of people who write literature and those who come to listen to literary discourses in literary programmes. Ghimire has been doing that through Rachana.Literary magazines were published at different times of the long autocratic Rana rule (1846-1950) in Nepal. They were the best means of creating a forum of expression, which would be creative and metaphorical. A careful study of Nepali literature written over the times shows that some of the most creative minds of this land had chosen literary writing as the medium of their expression. But it was challenging during the Rana regime. The writers, therefore, chose some easy ways. One was publishing literary magazines from Banaras, but they would not publish articles that would directly earn the wrath of the Rana rulers. Banaras had become the hub of publication for the Nepali writers who were either studying there or doing some small publication works. They would publish books on religious, social, folk and astrological themes and sell them within Nepal. Scholars have analysed this theme under the rubric 'print capitalism' by using a term introduced by Italian professor Francesca Orsini. I have no space to discuss the theme here.That activity was quite prolific in Banaras from the last years of the 19th century and the first or second decades of the 20th century. Editors and writers published their works and 'marketised' them among the Nepali language readers in Nepal and India. A small but quite diverse reading public came into existence. The literary magazines published by the youths there set a tradition of publication. They created forums to express their feelings and ideas couched in the language of religion or social or ethical writings. Literary magazines like Upanyas Tarangini (1902), Sundari (1906) and Madhavi (1914) were published from Banaras. But another centre, a hill area of Darjeeling, followed that tradition. The publication of Paras Mani Pradhan's Chandrika (1918) is one example. The magazines published in the 30s of the 20th century from Banaras and Kathmandu had a strong connection. They wanted to create a reading public whose sphere was small but important. The role played by 'print capitalism' was remarkable. In that context, the publication of Nepali Sahitya Sammelan Patrika (1931) from Darjeeling, Sharada (1934) from Kathmandu and Udaya (1936) from Banaras should be mentioned here.The publication of Sharada from Kathmandu is a vital event in Nepal's literary times. A cohort of writers decided to establish a forum to publish their views and inner feelings through symbols, metaphors and stories. The path was arduous, as they had to convince the Rana Prime Minister Juddha Shumsher, who was not happy about such a publication. But he saw some energy working there and allowed the writers to proceed with the work. He didn’t want them to cross a certain limit, though.Nepali literary critic Yadunath Khanal interpreted that juncture of time as a moment of tacit agreement between the writers and PM Juddha Shumsher. In one editorial of Sharada compiled in Sharadaka Sampadakiya Bicharharu (2001) by Shiva Regmi, we can read an important story. The editorial was obviously written by Riddhibahadur Malla.When a group of writers got an appointment to meet Juddha, he was sitting with a British envoy named Col CT Dox. An interpreter communicated the ideas of the British official to the writers. Dox's opinion was that since there was already a government newspaper named Gorkhapatra, there was no need to ask for another magazine. The envoy had also said to Juddha earlier, \"Now we are facing problems in Hindustan for allowing other papers to publish.\" Juddha asked the writers to heed the suggestion of the British envoy and not be enthusiastic about publishing Sharada. But as Yadunath Khanal said, Juddha allowed the writers to publish a literary magazine named Sharada in the winter of 1934. That was a tacit agreement between the rulers and the writers. However, the reference to the British anxiety regarding freedom to publish newspapers and magazines is notable. That also shows how the literary writers kept up the spirit of freedom and creative thinking through such tacit agreements. It was possible only through literary expressions. Literary magazines also came into existence after the political turn of the 1950s and of the 1960s. The continuity of the literary magazines run by individual literary persons like Uttam Kunwar and Balmukunda Pandey's Roop-Rekha, Rochak Ghimire's Rachana, Nagendra Sharma's Abhivyakti, Achyutraman Adhikari's Unnayan and a few others are unforgettable milestones of Nepali literary journeys. A survey of similar icons of the literary times of other languages of Nepal would make the picture complete. Literary magazines have traversed the difficult but important terrains of awakenings in this land.  \nRecently, a 34-year-old male with a two-day history of fever, nausea, weakness and body aches was admitted to the emergency department of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Kathmandu. His oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 95 percent on room air, and he tested positive for Covid-19. Covid-like illness is rising in the community, especially since the beginning of the monsoon season. It indicates that the disease itself might be circulating in Nepal. In fact, as per the World Health Organization (WHO) data, Nepal has observed a drastic increase in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, from 5.56 percent (week 28) to 13.68 percent (week 31) in a three week-interval (i.e., between July 8-14 and July 29-August 4). The variant responsible for the rapid increase of Covid infection rate in the community is unknown. Hence, it has been termed “monsoon covid” here.By the end of May 2024, Nepal had confirmed several Omicron sub-variants, including KP.1, KP.2, KP.3 and KP.4, also known as KP or “FLiRT” subvariants. Dozens of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 have been admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital since the beginning of March 2024. Most of the patients were aged 65 and above and required the intensive care unit. Until now, there is no evidence of an increase in hospitalisations due to monsoon covid. Nonetheless, it cannot be definitively ruled out that it may become severe in the upcoming days in Nepal. In the past, Nepal has typically experienced waves of Covid-19 following outbreaks in neighbouring India due to their shared border. Thus, we usually predict that when a Covid-19 outbreak occurs in India, Nepal will inevitably see a wave of Covid-19 after a couple of weeks or months. Nevertheless, this time, Nepal is observing monsoon covid before India, and it currently has the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in the Southeast-Asian region. As per the WHO data, India has maintained a constant rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the past four weeks (between week-28 and week-31), and in fact, even decreasing trend to 0.73 percent (i.e., July 29- August 4) from 3.26 percent (week-28, i.e., July 8-14). It is uncertain whether the monsoon covid will hit India in the coming days, but it is not impossible. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the main symptoms of Covid-19. However, the symptoms have varied over multiple waves with people exhibiting atypical symptoms like silent or happy hypoxia, loss of taste and smell and flu-like illness. Notably, the patient who visited STIDH did not have a cough and shortness of breath but exhibited a low platelet count, which is unusual in patients with Covid-19. Such a changing pattern of clinical symptoms of Covid-19 over the period is not surprising. The absence of cough, shortness of breath and the presence of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count, i.e., 70,000 per microliter of blood) is a rare phenomenon and thus worthwhile to study further. More cases, however, are needed to fully comprehend the monsoon covid and its evolving symptoms. Viruses evolve over time, and become more or less severe. We can, therefore, expect Covid-19 to continue to evolve with more genetic mutations in the coming days. Unfortunately, are unaware of the increasing trends of monsoon covid in Nepal and its reasons. It is wise to identify mutations or analyse genetic sequencing to understand the resurgence of monsoon covid.As of now, the seasonality of Covid-19 is not well established in Nepal. However, there have always been peaks (small or big) of Covid-19 cases during or around August in the past. Based on past data, we can assume that Covid-19 can reappear during the monsoon season every year in Nepal. Then, the question arises: Can we consider Covid-19 a seasonal virus like the influenza virus in Nepal? It is unknown whether monsoon covid will cause an increase in hospitalisations in the coming days, as seen in March 2024, owing to KP or “FLiRT” subvariants. However, such a scenario should not be underestimated. Although vaccines against the virus are available, people are not interested in getting jabbed. Preventive measures also help to avoid it, but vaccines are still important. Continuous surveillance, genetic analysis and vaccination should be prioritised. \nAnother August 14 has passed by with familiar proclamations about the evil designs of the proverbial ‘foreign hand’. As usual, outside conspirators are complemented by enemies inside our own borders. The list is long and comprised of absurdly opposed actors like retired spy chiefs and a women-led Baloch peace movement. Blanket categories like ‘digital terrorism’ are devised.The now months-old ban on social media sites like X has been extended with the operationalisation of a long-touted digital security system (also known as a firewall). Leaving aside for a while the absurd notion that all of this makes us safer, let us focus on the economic fallout that has been triggered.Pakistan is reportedly the fourth biggest gig economy in the world, with millions of (mostly young) people generating incomes through a host of digital platforms. There can be no romanticising the realities of pla­t­form capitalism; it is exploitative, has my­r­iad gendered effects and is cause and consequence of the unprecedented com­m­o­­d­i­f­i­c­a­tion of social life. Yet beggars can’t be choosers in a country where land grabbing, khaki real estate schemes, hoarding, contraband trade, useless mega infrast­ructure projects and the like represent the dominant model of ‘economic development’.Unlike most variants of Pakistani capitalism, the gig economy’s one saving grace is that it generates some employment opportunities for young, educated segments of the population, thus offsetting some of the demographic pressure that is culminating, with almost two million people joining the labour force annually.We have been here before. Temporary bans on YouTube, TikTok and other big social media sites have suffocated the livelihoods of those who have had more or less success monetising their content. Increasingly regular moves to suspend mobile data have badly affected precarious workers reliant on food delivery, ride-sharing and many other apps.The current internet clampdown is affe­c­ting all this as well as call centres, software developers, digital marketing and many other sub-sectors. Even basic commu­nications apps like WhatsApp have been crippled. A number of foreign companies—most prominently Fiverr—have suggested they will soon shift their operations away from Pakistan because their daily losses run into the millions. I care less abo­ut the profits of multinationals than I do about the call centre workers who are being deprived of even their meagre daily wages.The latest hybrid regime started off exhorting the need for foreign investment, and has now succeeded in thwarting its own stated imperative. In 2022, digital freelancers brought in $500 million, which is at least as much concrete currency than we’ve actually see come into the country through the much-touted SIFC.Our khaki-dominated ruling class is so consumed by palace intrigues and the windfall profits of big office that it is unable to see where it is taking what is already a sinking ship. When X and WhatsApp are dee­med threats to ‘national security’ because urban middle class types from military and civilian backgrounds—previously the biggest defenders of the established order—are now using these platforms to criticise the inc­umbent regime, it is obvious that the est­ablishment and its lackeys have lost the plot.It is unsurprising that the powers are petrified by youth-led movements in the peripheries, including the women-led Baloch Yekjheti Committee. Such movements are anti-establishment, and represent a threat to all warring ruling class factions. But here too even a slightly competent ruling class with an eye for the future would realise the clamping down on social media to suppress the group’s reach is a double-edged sword because digital freelancing helps incorporate at least some young disaffected Baloch (as well as Pakhtun, Sindhi, Gilgit-Baltistani, Kashmiri, Seraiki) youth into the system.But there is little competence here, only gimmicks like ‘Digital Pakistan’. Meanwhile young working people in the once-loyal Punjabi heartland are seeing their fragile middle class aspirations go up in smoke, which is, in turn, generating even more disaffection as evidenced not only through political opinions in digital spaces but also in the realms of art and culture. All of this can certainly be suppressed, but the economic pressure cooker cannot bubble over indefinitely.Let me be clear: the decision to suffocate the digital economy mostly affects white-collar youth. The vast majority of our blue-collar working population has no outlet whatsoever, other than menial jobs and emigration by any means necessary. But they could care less, so we should expect more of the same to come. Without a meaningful, countrywide alternative to the game of the thrones, we will all be reduced to freelancers for ruin.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nEighteen years after the decade-long Maoist insurgency (1996-2006) ended, there is finally some hope of justice for the victims. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives endorsed the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act 2014. (The bill has yet to pass the National Assembly and the President’s authentication, which will take some time.) This long-overdue amendment has also brought a much-needed relief for everyone who advocated for justice and reparation for those affected. The latest step will pave the way for completing the pending tasks of seeking truths about insurgency-era cases of violence and possible closures.Some provisions in the TRC Act called for amnesty to perpetrators of serious human rights violations. Several governments have been formed and toppled since the Supreme Court in 2015 directed the authorities to make necessary revisions to the Act. Years went by with no urgent actions, and justice remained a pipedream. Only recently did the leading parties—Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and Maoist Centre—heed the bill introduced by the former premier and Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal last year. Even though the bill has received a positive response from many quarters, including diplomats and heads of international organisations closely watching Nepal’s peace process, some human rights activists and victims are still concerned about some provisions in the bill. It categorises rape or serious cases of sexual violence, enforced disappearances and intentional killings as non-amnestiable, which is a sensible provision. But it allows for amnesty in other human rights violations cases and allows for reducing the sentence by up to 75 percent if perpetrators fulfil some set criteria except in rape or serious sexual violence cases, leaving space for manipulation. The bill also omits the issue of child soldiers used during the insurgency, and this is a serious concern. Given such flaws, there are genuine concerns as to whether the leaders are simply trying to end the chapter with minimal changes. That the major parties have come together to conclude this long-pending issue is laudable, but they shouldn’t use the bill to appease political factions or collect brownie points. The three leading party chairs—Sher Bahadur Deuba, KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal—marked the endorsement as a matter of national pride. Dahal, the chief architect of the insurgency, said he hoped it would “lead the country towards the conclusion of the peace process.” The first step the leaders should take is to work towards appointing officials to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of the Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons, both of which have been left in limbo for over two years. The next step is to heed the concerns and disagreements of the stakeholders of the peace process and resolve them. The TRC dream will translate into reality only with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a just and respectful environment for the victims. It remains to be seen if the law will be implemented as promised and hoped. If not, it will betray the very principles of justice and reparation upon which Nepal’s peace process was founded.  \nAt least 17 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli strike in the central Gaza town of Zawayda on Saturday, health officials said, as Israel issued new evacuation orders, citing Hamas rocket fire nearby.Israel also announced the names of two soldiers Israeli media reported were killed on Saturday afternoon when a roadside bomb exploded in the central Gaza Strip, and an air strike in the occupied West Bank that it said killed two senior Hamas militants involved in the killing of an Israeli.The violence occurred before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was expected to land in Israel on Sunday and meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, amid stepped-up diplomatic efforts to conclude a deal to end the fighting between Israel and the militant Islamist group and free Israeli hostages.Most of the people killed in Zawayda were from the same family and they included eight children and four women, according to health officials in the Hamas-administered enclave.“They were asleep in their beds, kids and babies, then three missiles targeted their place,” said Abu Ahmed Hassan, a neighbour. The owner of the house was a known merchant, he said. “There are no military activities here at all,” he added.The Israeli military said in response it had struck militant targets in an area from which rockets were fired at its troops. It said the incident was under review.Israel’s military spokesperson posted instructions in Arabic on X on Saturday for people in parts of central Gaza, including in the Maghazi district near Zawayda, to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone.Reuters could not immediately verify whether Zawayda was among the places ordered to evacuate and whether people there had received the military’s instructions. Residents said thousands were streaming out of Maghazi.On Friday, two sections of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis within what Israel has designated as a humanitarian zone were deemed dangerous by the military, which ordered people to evacuate them, saying militants had been regularly firing rockets from there.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Friday’s orders, which also included other areas of the enclave outside the humanitarian zones, had affected around 170,000 displaced people.“This is one of the largest evacuation orders affecting the zone to date and it shrinks the size of the so-called ‘humanitarian area’ to about 41 square kilometres, or 11 per cent of the total area of the Gaza Strip,” an OCHA report said.In the central part of the enclave, residents said Israeli tanks advanced further on Saturday into the eastern area of Deir al-Balah, an area they had not entered before, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.The Israeli military said that since Friday its forces had killed dozens of militants, including some who had fired rockets from central and southern Gaza.Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population has been displaced by the 10-month-old Israeli offensive, which has laid waste to much of the enclave.Another Israeli airstrike on a car in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin on Saturday killed at least two more Palestinians, one an 18-year-old, the Palestinian health ministry said.CEASEFIRE TALKSGaza ceasefire talks in Doha, mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt, were due to resume next week.A statement from Netanyahu’s office said Israel’s negotiating team had expressed “cautious optimism” on the possibility of advancing a deal “in accordance with the updated American proposal (based on the May 27th framework), including components acceptable to Israel.”US President Joe Biden said on Friday, following two days of talks in Doha, that efforts to reach a deal were now in sight, although he warned that negotiations were “far from over”.Hamas spokesman Jihad Taha told Al Jazeera TV on Saturday that Israel had added conditions in the ceasefire talks and accused Netanyahu of using these to hinder the efforts.Asked about Blinken’s visit to the region, he said the group did not rely on the US as it has been biased towards Israel.Another Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told Al Jazeera that Israel wanted the right to return to the fight even if a prisoner exchange was agreed. “They want to have the right to attack Gaza whenever they want,” he said.The war was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel’s subsequent military campaign has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel has lost more than 330 soldiers in Gaza since its ground operations there began after Oct. 7, and says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters. \nToday, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, Karnali Province, and Sudurpaschim Province are expected to experience generally to mostly cloudy conditions, while the remaining provinces will see partly to generally cloudy skies. Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is likely in various parts of Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with a few showers also expected in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.There is a possibility of heavy rainfall in isolated areas of Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces.Tonight, the entire country will witness partly to generally cloudy conditions. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is expected in many parts of all provinces. Heavy rainfall may occur in some areas of Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces.On Saturday, Janakpur recorded the highest maximum temperature at 38.4°C, while Jomsom reported the lowest minimum temperature at 14.5°C. Bhairahawa received the most significant rainfall, measuring 21.6 mm in the past 24 hours. \nThe Nepali Embassy in Canada has cautioned students preparing to study in Canada about the opportunities and challenges they might encounter there.Citing that students might feel they faced “unprecedented hardship” if they were initially lured by tempting stories, the embassy urged students to be cautious.“Take time to research the opportunities and hardships you are likely to encounter in the new country before making it your destination,” read the statement issued by the embassy.The embassy suggested that students would encounter fewer problems if they conducted adequate research and gathered detailed information about their college, the subject they wish to study, the costs involved, and the location of the college before applying.Before making Canada their study destination, all are advised to obtain enough information from relatives, friends, peers, former students, social media networks, non-resident Nepali associations in the respective cities, and Nepali diaspora organisations about the college, its location, the method of study, expenses, availability of housing, and employment opportunities, the embassy added. \nNepal has been selected as the host of the 2025 ICC U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup Asia Qualifier, set to take place from April 12 to April 21, 2025.The Asia Qualifier is one of the five regional qualifier tournaments to determine the final five teams for the 2026 U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup, with Africa Qualifier, European Qualifier, East-Asia Pacific Qualifier and Americas Qualifier being the other four competitions.One team from each (five) region will qualify for the main event.“Nepal has been selected as the host nation for the ICC U19 Men’s Cricket World Cup Asia Qualifier 2025,” the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) said in a press release on Saturday. The Asia Qualifier will feature Nepal (hosts), Afghanistan, Hong Kong, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The teams will vie for one spot in the 2026 U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup. “This event marks a significant milestone for cricket in Nepal, and the nation looks forward to welcoming these teams and showcasing its passion for the sport on an international stage,” the cricket governing body added.With home support, Nepal will look to qualify for the World Cup for a consecutive time after featuring in the 2024 ICC U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup in South Africa. Nepal had topped the six-team table remaining unbeaten to secure their ticket to the 2024 World Cup—their first World Cup in eight years.In South Africa, Nepal had pulled off a thrilling one-wicket victory over Test member Afghanistan in the group stage to progress to the Super Six. The 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by Zimbabwe and Namibia. \nNepal's Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba will visit India from Sunday to Thursday for talks with her counterpart S Jaishankar, aimed at strengthening Nepal-India relations and promoting cooperation on various areas of mutual interest.\nNepal will deploy drones to remove garbage from Mount Everest, using DJI heavy lifters to reduce risks faced by Sherpas during supply transportation tasks.\nIn the Nepali Congress, two young general secretaries, Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma, have struggled to assert their authority amid a dominant establishment led by party president Deuba, despite their initial popular mandate.\nAjaya Dixit emphasizes the importance of river conservation, highlights the problems caused by human encroachment, and advocates for a holistic approach to river management, integrating natural sciences, social sciences, and indigenous knowledge.\nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \nIn the past, Nepali students did not dream of studying at prestigious American and European universities. People weren’t captivated by travelling across continents or romanticising life in Europe. Instead, they lined up along the trails of Kuti, drawn to the allure of Tibetan monasteries. Nepalis imagined Tibetan nymphs serving salted tea with cheerful smiles, embodying their aspirations.It was a time when the elegance of men and women dressed in Kuchin robes and Chinese silk surpassed any modern luxury. Faith, trade, and fame converged in one place; for Nepalis, that place was Lhasa.Dor Bahadur Bista's ‘Sotala’ is set in a distinct era when “all roads led north”. It was a time when the routes to Lhasa were bustling, with traders carrying their goods and dreams. The story is set in 18th-19th century Nepal and Tibet, a period when trade across the Himalayas was flourishing, Hindu and Buddhist cultures were intertwined, and the wealth of Nepalis was on the rise. Though short, the account is historical and fictional, blending imagination with truth. Bista's story goes beyond mere characters and events, exploring the rich historical, social, cultural, and political landscapes of the time.Instead, ‘Sotala’ offers a broad commentary on the entire sociopolitical and cultural fabric of 18th-century Nepal Tibet. Like Émile Zola's ‘Germinal’ and Lisa See's ‘The Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane’, Sotala enriches sociocultural commentary through its fictional settings. It presents compelling characters, engaging plots, and fascinating insights into anthropology, sociology, and philosophy, making it much more than just a work of literature. This blend of elements is because Bista isn't just a literary figure; he is a renowned anthropologist. He is best known for his nonfiction works, such as ‘Fatalism’, ‘Development’, and ‘People of Nepal’, which brought him recognition outside the literary world. However, his talent extends beyond academia. In ‘Sotala’, readers can see how he applies his academic knowledge to craft a refined work of historical fiction.The book draws from Bista's time as the Consul General in Tibet, where he gained extensive knowledge about Tibet and Nepal-Tibet relations. His insights are evident in his non-fiction work, ‘Reports from Lhasa’. As the Nepali consulate was the only foreign presence in the region, Bista had a unique opportunity to observe Tibetan culture closely. In a 1997 interview with Fisher, Bista described ‘Sotala’ as a distinctive blend of fiction and ethnography. He explained, \"In a way, it's a novel, but at the same time, I included a lot of ethnographic material.\"Further elaborating, Bista said, “If I had pursued anthropology further, I might have stopped creative writing. Conversely, if I hadn’t studied anthropology, I would have focused solely on creative writing. I became a blend of both, half this, half that.”Sanuman, an honest and successful Nepali merchant living in Lhasa, narrates the story. Through his recollections, we are introduced to his past. As Sanuman reflects on his life, the events gradually unfold. He recalls his childhood in Jaisidewal, where he was once captivated by a girl from his neighbourhood. His mother was determined to make the girl her daughter-in-law. However, fate intervened when the son of the wealthy Tuladhar, who had made his fortune in Lhasa, abducted her. In Lhasa, Sanuman first encountered the unpredictable nature of life and fortune.Unable to face the humiliation, Sanuman leaves home with dreams of Lhasa and limited finances. Various challenges mark his journey: sometimes, he is mistaken for a thief and detained by officials, and other times, he makes unfortunate mistakes. The story chronicles both his triumphs and misfortunes.Sanuman begins his journey as a tradesman and a traveller with Sankhu Saau-an, a shrewd businessman trading in Lhasa. As his apprentice, Sanuman learns the trade secrets of Tibet. He follows Sankhu Saau-an’s example, eventually building his business empire. The narrative tracks Sanuman's transformation from a humble apprentice to a successful merchant and from a young bachelor to a proud father.Following Sanuman’s journey, we are introduced to the everyday realities of that era. For instance, on his first trip to Lhasa, Sankhu Saau-an instructs Sanuman to deliver goods to the Nepali customs official's lodgings. In his naivety, Sanuman asks for payment for the merchandise. This action angers the official and teaches Sanuman a crucial lesson: success in trade requires more than just calculations; a merchant who couldn't master the art of bribery was doomed to fail.The book also addresses political issues, cultural differences, and economic realities. It portrays the class system in Tibet and the exploitation of the peasantry during the oppressive Lamacracy. The struggles and hardships faced by the people are a central theme. Additionally, the book highlights the superstitious aspects of Tibetan society, such as the use of the Dalai Lama's urine as a potent medicine, showcasing the peculiarities of that culture. It contrasts Tibet's traditional customs and orthodoxy with Kolkata's role as a hub of innovation and progress.The book effectively explains the trade practices of the time to illustrate this contrast. It describes how the old, challenging route through Kuti was eventually replaced by the more convenient and accessible Kalingpong route. The decline of Kathmandu's prominence favouring Kolkata and the subsequent decline of Nepali merchants are thoroughly examined. The book emphasises and masterfully chronicles this transformation, showing how traditional methods of trade and commerce evolved with the introduction of new tools and modern logistics.While ‘Sotala’ offers a broad and engaging narrative, it has some literary flaws. The story begins with a single narrator but later shifts to multiple perspectives, confusing readers. The plot sometimes feels rushed; other times, it must be faster, with certain characters introduced but left underdeveloped. Additionally, frequent changes in setting and introducing new plotlines can further puzzle readers.Despite these shortcomings, ‘Sotala’ compensates with its rich cultural, sociological, political, and anthropological context. It is more than just a work of fiction; it blends anthropology, ethnography, and sociology into a compelling fable, making it a valuable read.Pokharel is a third-year BALLB student.SotalaAuthor: Dor Bahadur BistaPublisher: Sajha PrakashanYear: 1976 \nCPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has been leading the party for over three-and-a-half decades, has yet again pacified the leaders who want him to hand over the leadership.Janardan Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—deputy general secretaries of the Maoist party—had demanded that Dahal hand over the party leadership to a leader of their generation. The two leaders raised the issue during the standing committee meeting that commenced on August 9.Leaders concluded the meeting on Thursday as they decided to strengthen the Maoist party through internal dialogue between the leaders on their disagreements.Party secretary Ram Karki said that responding to the questions raised during the standing committee meeting on August 10, party chair Dahal vowed to address their issues.The party will resolve the theoretical as well as ideological differences among the party leaders through dialogue, Karki told the Post, quoting Dahal.On August 9, the first day of the meeting, the Maoist chair presented a verbal proposal on current political affairs, party building, and other pertinent issues.After Dahal’s presentation, some leaders raised questions about the party’s policies and leadership. Among them, Janardan Sharma, a deputy general secretary, submitted a written proposal on August 10, calling for a review of Dahal’s leadership and suggesting that the party chair be limited to a ceremonial role as patron.In his document, Sharma alleged, among other things, that the party leadership was trying to use state power against him.In the 14-page document submitted to the meeting, Sharma accused the party leadership of ‘spreading disinformation’ about him and the other deputy general secretary, Pun. He also accused the top leaders of even misusing state power against him.“The fake information about the party split, which was generated from Khumaltar [the private residence of Dahal], spread widely after reaching Baluwatar [the prime minister’s official residence where Dahal was staying until last month when the government changed],” Sharma questions the party leadership in his document. “There are questions: why did the leadership disseminate fake information?”However, Maoist Centre leaders said the issue has been settled, for now, after Dahal pledged to resolve it through intra-party discussions.Party chair Dahal, while speaking to the press briefly after the conclusion of the standing committee meeting on Thursday, said the reports and rumours about party split were baseless.“Rumours related to the party split led by comrade Prabhakar [Janardan Sharma] are baseless,” Dahal told journalists.The meeting also decided to hold consultative meetings at the provincial level, where the party's office bearers will also participate. After the meeting, the party will call for a full-fledged meeting of the central committee in mid-September (Ashoj first week).Another party secretary, Devendra Paudel, said the upcoming central committee meeting will call the party's special general convention, as decided during the eigth general convention held in 2022.But Lilamani Pokharel, a party secretary, says no decision was taken with regard to convening a special general convention as only the central committee has a mandate to call a special general convention, the supreme body of a party that can take final decisions on the party’s policies and leadership.“The party will go for a special general convention only if a central committee meeting decides to go for that,” Pokharel told the Post.After the party was out of the government in mid-July, calls for Dahal to relinquish the top position have grown. Haribol Gajurel, a close aide of Dahal and deputy general secretary, also raised the issue of leadership change during a meeting of party officials before the standing committee meeting and demanded a special congress to address the issues.Gajurel proposed that all office-bearers should resign and make a fresh start to rejuvenate the party. He even submitted his own resignation as a starting point. Following this, on the second day of the standing committee meeting held on August 10, Deputy General Secretary Sharma questioned the central leadership in his political paper.However, party spokesperson Agni Sapkota, who is close to Dahal, argued that the questions raised by Sharma were aimed at strengthening the party. “The issue I raised during the standing committee meeting was for the betterment of the party and to strengthen the leadership of Dahal,” Sapkota quoted Sharma as saying.“The party leadership has also taken the issue raised by the standing committee members, including deputy general secretary Gajurel, Sharma, and Barshaman Pun, on a positive note.”During Dahal's tenure as prime minister, Gajurel, his political adviser, had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the party's lack of adherence to procedures and methods. As questions arose about the central leadership of the Maoist Centre, which is focused on organisational development, Dahal found himself in a defensive position during the standing committee meeting. According to party insiders, it was after a long time that Dahal faced tremendous pressure during a standing committee meeting as both Sharma and Pun, who have strong command in the party organisation, stood together to demand Dahal’s exit from the party leadership. It was something unusual for Maoist leaders as the two leaders, who defended Dahal in the past, joined hands by closing their ranks to fiercely criticise the party chief. Sharma and Pun, both former finance ministers, are deemed the two most powerful leaders after Dahal.Both leaders claimed the position of general secretary at the party’s general convention in early 2022. Though they were willing to contest for the post, Dahal instead chose Dev Gurung as the general secretary. After the general convention, Sharma has been maintaining a distance from Dahal and he challenges the party chief on various occasions. Of late, Pun, too, has joined Sharma to challenge Dahal. At the standing committee meeting, Pun said there should be a debate on the party's chairperson's term limit. \"Instead of discussing whether the leader should step down now, we need to determine the chair’s term limit,\" he added. Leaders said Dahal faced a pressure of this scale in a party meeting probably for the first time in nearly a decade, since the exit of key leaders Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya. Bhattarai and Baidya lead their own parties now. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana is set to visit India from August 18-21, on her first official trip after taking office.The visit by the foreign minister comes a week after new Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri concluded a two–day familiarisation visit to Nepal just this week. During her time in India, according to the foreign ministry officials, Rana will hold talks with her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar and other officials and discuss several issues of mutual interests.Separate requests have been sent for meetings with Indian PresidentDroupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with confirmation still pending, according to foreign ministry officials privy to the visit preparations. She will also meet senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders.“We are waiting for confirmation for both the meetings as Prime Minister KP Oli is keen to host Indian Prime Minister Modi in Nepal,” an official said. “It is the Indian prime minister's turn to visit Nepal, so our focus would be on making that visit happen,” the official said. Rana was planning to visit Delhi for a routine health checkup, but after India expressed interest in turning it into an official visit, she received an invitation from her Indian counterpart, Jaishankar, sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.Rana and Jaishankar are scheduled to meet in New Delhi on Monday to discuss issues from the seventh joint commission meeting in Kathmandu earlier this year, according to the officials.The Joint Commission meeting reviewed all aspects of bilateral relations and areas of cooperation including connectivity, infrastructure development, economic partnership, trade, transit, investment, power, water resources, culture, tourism, sports, health and education.During her meeting with Misri on Monday, Rana requested additional air routes to Nepal to increase air connectivity between Nepal and India, setting up a sophisticated laboratory at the Nepal-India border to test the quality of the vegetables and fruits imported from India for pesticides, expediting the negotiations for the finalisation of the detailed project report of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project that remains in limbo for years. They also discussed issues such as discharging the water from the Tanakpur canal, river training in the Banganga, Khado, and Rapti rivers with Indian assistance, and the inauguration of the suspension bridge in Darchula linking Nepal and India, according to the foreign ministry statement. The upcoming visit is expected to focus on discussing matters of mutual interest rather than signing understandings or agreements, a joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post. \nDiscussion on whether or not to have statute of limitations in corruption cases takes the centre stage as the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the House of Representatives works to finalise the bill to amend the Corruption Prevention Act 2002.The KP Sharma Oli government in 2019 had registered the amendment bill in the National Assembly. After long deliberations, the Assembly had sent the bill to the House after endorsing it in April last year. However, the lower house is still debating it. The statute of limitation is a bone of contention.A provision in the bill says, “The corruption case must be prosecuted within five years from the date of knowing that such an act has been committed.\" But there is no time limit in lodging the case where the state suffers direct losses.Even if someone is retired from any profession, s/he can be prosecuted within five years of retirement, says another provision in the amendment bill.After the discussion on the limit in the parliamentary committee, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority has proposed to widen the window to 10 years.However, the parties have yet to agree on the matter. While some Nepali Congress and Rastriya Swatantra Party lawmakers want removal of the provision, other parties have not made their official positions clear yet.Oli, who appeared before the House committee on July 22, made no comment on it. CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was present during the discussion in the House committee on Thursday, also did not make his position clear.“Let’s have an intensive discussion on whether to keep the statute of limitations and for how long,” said Dahal. Congress leaders, however, are vocal against such limitation. Reiterating his position, Nepali Congress lawmaker Gagan Thapa said there can be no statute of limitation in corruption cases.Thapa, who is also the Congress general secretary, has registered a proposal to remove the limit.Taking part in the deliberations on the bill on Thursday, Congress lawmaker Hridaya Ram Thani said no corruption committed before 2018-19 can be investigated if five years of limitation is imposed.“On the one hand, we are talking about investigating the corruption cases after 1990. On the other, there is the issue of five-year limitation. This is contradictory,” said Thani.An official at the constitutional watchdog said it is the legislature’s prerogative whether or not to have a limit of investigating corruption cases. Thani demands that the bill must give investigators the mandate to examine the decisions from the local level to the federal Cabinet for irregularities. He said that “policy decisions” should be explained in the law. So far Cabinet decisions in particular are legally exempted from investigation.The ruling UML is yet to make its position clear on the time limit. Experts have expressed concern that if the bill is passed, it will not be possible to prosecute those in power. They will use it as a loophole to obtain clean chits, they say.Sharing his views on the bill, Dahal, the prime minister preceding Oli, said that the provision of automatic suspension of those holding public offices once the commission lodges a case against them in the Special Court needs to be revisited.Citing incidents of the accused getting clean chits, he said there should be discussions on incorporating the provision of no suspension until conviction.“Or compensate for the period of suspension if [the person is] acquitted by the court [later],” Dahal said. “This is not my conclusion but just a food for thought.” \nEnding nearly a decade of confusion, the House of Representatives on Wednesday endorsed the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act by a majority vote.The amendment to the Act was necessitated after the Supreme Court in February 2015 struck down provisions that allowed amnesty for serious violations of human rights, directing the government to make necessary revisions. Despite this directive, successive governments until recently made no serious attempts towards changing the law as directed by the top court.The serious visible efforts to this effect was seen when the chiefs of the major three parties on July 1 formed a three-party mechanism to find a common ground on the contentious provisions in the bill. With consent from the top leadership the mechanism on August 7 reached a written agreement on the bill. Based on the tripartite agreement, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the lower house approved the bill, which was under consideration for over a year, the very next day. The erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government had in March last year introduced the bill in parliament. It was under consideration for more than a year following differences among the parties on the content until last week’s agreement.The bill that was presented in parliament on Tuesday got endorsed the next day after all the lawmakers except the only one from the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party stood against it. Addressing the House, before the bill was put to a vote, top leaders of big parties claimed the country was moving towards accomplishing the remaining task of the peace process—the transitional justice. Putting his view before the lower house, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said Nepal’s transitional justice process would be completed by adopting Nepal’s own homegrown model. “The commissions will get full shape with the new Act in place and they will get a favourable environment to function,” said Oli, who also is the chairperson of the CPN-UML. “Our transitional justice process will be exemplary, setting an example to the world.”The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of the Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons are lying paralysed for over two years in the absence of their office bearers. Although a committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former Supreme Court chief justice is in place, it has not been able to function following the National Human Rights Commission’s refusal to send its representative demanding amendment to the Act.Also addressing the lower house, Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba claimed that the bill ensures truth, justice, reparation and non-occurrence of the conflict. “It adheres to our existing laws, the verdict of the Supreme Court and international standards of transitional justice,” he said.Similarly, CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal said the endorsement in the bill will lead the country towards the conclusion of the peace process. “Our peace process is a model in the world. We are leading it with our own experience and methods,” he said.While the top leaders unanimously claimed that the bill ensures a victim-centric transitional justice process with no amnesty for serious violations of human rights, the victims and the human rights defenders have divided opinions on the bill that got through the lower house. A group of victims united under the National Network of Victims and Survivors of Serious Human Rights and National Association of Conflict Rape Victims have jointly welcomed the endorsement of the bill calling it a historic achievement. Ram Bandari and Devi Khadka coordinators of the two associations respectively have jointly said that the bill is in line with the demands of the grassroots victims for prompt truth, justice and reparation. However, Charan Prasai, a human rights activist said the bill is full of flaws guided by amnesty even in serious violations of human rights. “The parties had in 2015 introduced the law unanimously, but it was struck down by the court. The bill endorsed on Wednesday too is full of problematic provisions,” he said.The bill lists rape or serious cases of sexual violence, intentional or arbitrary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture as serious violations of human rights and thus non-amnestiable. Other incidents fall under human rights violations and are amnestiable. One of the provisions in the bill clears the way for reconciliation in cases other than serious violations of human rights. The attorney general cannot be forced to press ahead with a legal case in incidents of human rights violations or serious violations of human rights where there has been reconciliation or a recommendation for amnesty, according to the bill.Except in cases of rape or serious sexual violence, there can be a reduction in the sentencing by 75 percent if the perpetrators fulfil some set criteria. Decisions on reduced penalty can be taken after examining whether the perpetrators provide information on the allegations against them, whether they cooperate with the commissions on evidence collection and whether they express remorse for their acts. Similarly, before recommending a reduction in penalty, the commissions need to evaluate whether the perpetrators have apologised to the victims and made commitments to not repeat such acts. All disqualified Maoist combatants including child soldiers, along with the families of security personnel who died or got injured during the insurgency, will get reparation and compensation, as per the agreement. However, the issue of child soldiers, which is considered a war crime, along with crimes against humanity and other acts of war crime is not mentioned in the agreement.Now the bill will be forwarded to the upper house for approval. It will come into force after the authentication from the President.Meanwhile, some Kathmandu-based diplomatic missions have welcomed the development. Within hours after the House endorsed the bill, the envoys took to social media to congratulate Nepal terming it a historic achievement.US Ambassador Dean R Thompson congratulated the people of Nepal on the occasion. \"This is a meaningful moment in Nepal’s journey to shaping its own peaceful, prosperous, resilient, and democratic future,\" he wrote on X.United Nations Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer-Hamdy described the passage of the bill as a crucial step in the peace process. “Engaging victims is imperative - 'nothing for us without us' - for successful implementation,\" she wrote on X. “The UN stands ready to support inclusive TJ aligning with international human rights commitments and standards.\"Also, Veronique Lorenzo, the ambassador of the European Union to Nepal, congratulated Nepal and Nepali people for the historic achievement. Describing it as a Nepal-led and owned, victim centric TRC bill, the EU welcomed the achievement and reiterated its commitment for full support in its implementation. \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nBarahi Jungle Lodge has been announced as Nepal’s first hotel to receive certification under the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) Hotel Sustainability Basics programme.This certification recognises hotels that excel in sustainability by implementing essential criteria for responsible operations. Barahi Jungle Lodge’s achievement highlights its excellence in three core areas: energy efficiency, planet-friendly operations, and community support. The lodge has implemented various measures, including reducing energy consumption, eliminating single-use plastics, and actively supporting local communities. This dedication sets a new benchmark for sustainable hospitality in Nepal. In addition to the WTTC certification, Barahi Jungle Lodge has also been awarded the TOFTigers Outstanding Certification, a testament to its commitment to conservation and responsible tourism.The WTTC’s Hotel Sustainability Basics is a global standard designed to guide hotels in their sustainability journey, with 12 fundamental criteria covering environmental, social, and operational practices. \nAfter the devastating earthquakes in 2015, Nepal saw a dramatic shift in dietary habits, stimulated by the inflow of cash for reconstruction. This massive cash inflow also led to an explosion in the availability of packaged snack foods.Now, people are avid consumers of fast food and packaged foods, and the trading and manufacturing of such food businesses are growing exponentially.This inadvertently increased the demand for unhealthy foods as people become accustomed to readily available options, according to the Global Food Policy Report 2024, published by the International Food Policy Research Institute recently.These foods with low nutritional content are packaged and ready to eat at any given point.“The emergency food aid provided after the earthquake included packaged foods like instant noodles,” the report said.Poor diet quality is a significant reason for poor nutrition outcomes. The report, authored by multiple experts, covers Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia, South Asia, East and South East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.According to the report, 45 percent of Nepal's population consumes salty and fried snacks. The country's vegetable intake has been poor, with 11 percent of the population consuming “zero” vegetables and fruits.The report said progress is slowing on reducing undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies in low- and middle-income countries while observing a rapid rise in overweight and obesity rates. This double burden of malnutrition—where undernutrition coexists with diet-related noncommunicable diseases—poses significant global health challenges.The report also stresses that food systems significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation, urging their transformation to reduce environmental impacts while ensuring food security. Malnutrition rates remain high, and non-communicable diseases are rising in South Asia.“With the increased consumption of packaged food, particularly by the children, it has sharply increased childhood obesity. Overconsumption of zero nutrition and zero calorie packaged food has increased the malnutrition rate in children, especially school-age ones,” said Dr Sudhashree Adhikari, a nutritionist.“Immature growth in children and disturbance in the menstruation cycle is being seen in women, largely due to the consumption of packaged and processed meat and dairy products. These products often contain growth hormones used in poultry, dairy, and cattle production.”“Producers inject hormonal growth supplements into poultry to speed up production, and these hormones get stored in the animal’s organs,” she said. “When people consume these products, it can lead to hormonal imbalances.”Adhikari said that hormonal imbalance in women and chronic hypertension and diabetes in men have sharply gone up mainly due to the high intake of carbohydrates that are found in packaged and processed food.According to experts, the low and middle-income brackets have been cutting their healthy food intake from their plates with the rising prices of vegetables and dairy products.The report said nearly 80 percent of Nepal's population cannot afford a healthy diet as healthier food options cost more in countries with poorer infrastructure and logistics.It has been several months since the prices of most green vegetables crossed over Rs100 per kg. For instance, even a kg of bottle gourd, a common and seasonal vegetable, costs around Rs120 per kg in retail.As Nepal does not produce enough fruits, most of the fruit requirements are fulfilled through imports. For example, a kg of Chinese Fuji apples costs around Rs400.The report said that only 1.1 percent of Nepali adults (over 15 years old) consume 400 grams of fruits and vegetables daily, which is the WHO's recommendation.Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants that protect against numerous diseases.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, vegetable inflation increased by 16.02 percent in mid-June compared to last year.For example, lately, dairy companies have struggled to sell milk. They have converted the milk into powder and butter, but even these products remain unsold, leaving tonnes of the products piling up in the warehouses of the state-owned and private dairies.Both state-owned and private dairy companies said the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for several months.Nepal’s growth rate, which measures the country’s output and people's income, has remained dismal, averaging 3.4 percent in the last five years.Import figures show the clear picture of how packaged foods have grown and displaced traditional food habit systems.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 2,420 tonnes of chocolates worth Rs1.66 billion in the last fiscal year ended July 15.The country also imported 4,146 tonnes of sweet biscuits worth Rs997.62 million, 1,657 tonnes of Kurkure and Lays worth Rs911.78 million, 2,818 tonnes of dalmoth and namkeen worth Rs800.95 million, and 1,867 tonnes of packaged bakery items worth Rs612.58 million.The country imported 1,609 tonnes of chewing gum worth Rs582.74 and 1,478 frozen French fries worth Rs226.26 million.Hem Raj Regmi, the deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office, said that packaged and processed food consumption is increasing in the country mainly due to rapid urbanisation, a rise in single families, a growing number of working women, and changing food habits.“The remittance is the key. It has fueled the consumption of such products,” said Regmi, who holds a doctoral (PhD) in food security.He said that remittances affect food expenditure in two distinct ways.“When you have money, you increase your calorie intake, but income from remittances may also compound trends toward purchasing less healthy foods associated with the nutrition transition.”Experts said that unchecked sale of packaged and processed food items, especially in rural parts of the country, easy availability of counterfeit food and beverage products with no quality inspection, and the import of packaged food products high in palm oil and sugar are causing severe health issues in the majority of people.The government's lax inspection has also led to an increase in traders selling expired food items by relabeling them.In Nepal, 39 percent of the population consumes all five recommended food groups, including at least one starchy staple, one vegetable, one fruit, one pulse, one nut and seed, and one animal-source food, the study states.The report said poor diets are caused by a mix of factors: insufficient crop diversity; low affordability due to low per capita income and higher prices of nutritious foods; inefficient, underdeveloped markets and value chains; easy access to highly processed foods; and aggressive promotion.According to the poultry association, an egg now costs around Rs25 in retail, up from Rs17 a year earlier and has become out of reach for most low-income people.The report said that in 2050, no countries in sub-Saharan Africa and few countries in Asia and the Pacific could supply the World Health Organization’s minimum recommended daily per capita intake of 400 grams of fruits and vegetables.Adhikari said that vegetables and fruits fulfil the required micronutrients, like vitamins and minerals. Live enzymes, Vitamin B12, and calcium are also found in vegetables and fruits, and such products are less consumed. \nDespite regular supply, the prices of most vegetables in Kathmandu Valley have gone up sharply, forcing the majority of Nepalis to cut the recommended daily vegetable intake.Traders said that farmers have increased the rates of vegetables due to the rise in the cost of production.The comparative price index of the wholesale vegetable market in Kalimati shows that the price of vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and other seasonal and non-seasonal vegetables has increased within two weeks.“The supply situation is normal,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the country’s largest vegetables and fruits marketplace. “Normally, the vegetable price goes up in the rainy season. This year, farmers have increased the prices of their crops, and as a result, prices have increased sharply.”He said that farmers’ crops have been hit by excessive rainfall. The heatwave, too, affected production. “To compensate for their losses, vegetable prices increased at the farm gate.”The Kalimati market received over 700 tonnes of vegetables on Wednesday, which is considered a normal supply.The wholesale price of all three different types of tomatoes has increased. The price of tomato big (Nepali) has increased by 26.67 percent to Rs95 per kg, while the price of tomato small (local) has jumped by 101.52 percent to Rs45 per kg, and the price of tomato small (tunnel) has gone up by 92.13 percent to Rs61 per kg.The potato price has also increased significantly. The price of potato red (Indian) has increased by 3.64 percent to Rs57 per kg, potato red (Mudhe) has gone up by 15.69 percent to Rs59 per kg, and potato white has risen by 4.57 percent to Rs53.33 per kg.The dry onion price increased by 18.63 percent to Rs97.67 per kg. Shrestha said the onion price has been impacted by the rise in the Indian onion price.The wholesale price of cabbage (local) has jumped by 30.05 percent to Rs75 per kg within two weeks. The wholesale price of cauli local (Jyapu) has also risen by 15.79 percent to Rs110 per kg.On Thursday, the Cowpea (long) price increased by 26.67 percent to Rs95 per kg.The price of bottle gourd has increased by 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg and smooth gourd by 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg.Despite being seasonal vegetables, the price of pointed gourds has increased. The wholesale price is Rs75 per kg, up 36.36 percent.Similarly, the price of French beans (local) increased by 46.15 percent to Rs95 per kg, while the price of French beans (hybrid) also increased by 46.15 percent to Rs95 per kg within two weeks.The wholesale price of sword beans climbed by 4.55 percent to Rs115 per kg.The prices of squash (round) and okra have also gone up. The squash round price has gone up 30.77 percent to Rs85 per kg, and the okra price has gone up 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, vegetable inflation increased by 16.02 percent in mid-June compared to the same period last year.A separate report said that Nepalis are consuming fewer vegetables and fruits due to cost factors and their growing habit of consuming packaged foods.According to Global Food Policy Report 2024, published by the International Food Policy Research Institute last month, in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, children under two years get a quarter of their calories from unhealthy snack foods and beverages.The report said that only 1.1 percent of Nepalis adults (over 15 years old) consume 400 grams of fruits and vegetables daily, which is the WHO's recommendation. The report showed that Nepal’s consumption of salty and fried snacks is high among South Asian nations, with more than 40 percent of the population eating them.Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants that protect against numerous diseases.The report said that in 2050, no countries in sub-Saharan Africa and few countries in Asia and the Pacific could supply the World Health Organization’s minimum recommended daily per capita intake of 400 grams of fruits and vegetables.The cost premium—that is, the additional cost for the least-cost nutrient-adequate diet above the least-cost source of calorie adequacy—is larger in South Asia than in any other region.For example, dark green leafy vegetables and vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables cost 8 to 22 times more per calorie than starchy staples and twice as much per calorie as sugary and salty snacks.A study in a low-income country revealed substantial changes in food behaviours over the past decade, with increased consumption of rice, meat, and highly processed snack foods. \nYeti Airlines has obtained the ISSA (IATA Standard Safety Assessment) certification for international safety standards, which highlights the airline’s unwavering commitment to the highest standards of aviation safety. “We are extremely honoured to have received the ISSA registration, which is a significant achievement in our ongoing journey to enhance safety and operational excellence,” said Subhas Sapkota,CEO of Yeti Airlines. “This achievement reflects the hard work and dedication of our entire team, as well as our commitment to providing our passengers with the safest and most reliable air travel experience.” The ISSA programme thoroughly evaluates the airline operator’s safety management system before awarding the certificate. \nAmid heavy rainfall in many places across the country, Anbukhaireni Rural Municipality of Tanahun district has been hit by a massive dengue outbreak, with over 900 positive cases in a single ward within a month.Local health facilities are struggling to cope with the overwhelming number of seriously ill patients.“Over 900 people from ward 3 have tested positive for dengue within a month,” Agam Raj Upadhyaya, health coordinator of the rural municipality, told the Post over the phone from Anbukhaireni. “Forty-five patients are currently being treated on just 15 beds at Anbukhaireni Hospital. The hospital floors and corridors are packed with infected people.”Health officials warn that the actual number of dengue cases could be higher, as people having mild symptoms are not getting tested and are resting at home.They also informed that around two dozen seriously ill patients have been sent to Chitwan, Pokhara, and Kathmandu for further treatment.“What worries us most is that with the spike in positive cases, we are also seeing an increase in seriously ill patients,” said Upadhyaya. “These patients need intensive care, which is why we have to refer them to Chitwan, Kathmandu and Pokhara.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.So far two died and 3755 tested positive with the dengue virus that has spread in 74 districts across the country.Public health experts say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic. Data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division shows that only 715 people have tested positive for the virus in Tanahun, far less than what is reported by the rural municipality.“We don’t know how they are counting, but we have reported all the confirmed cases,” said Upadhyaya.Other health officials also told the Post that health authorities are misrepresenting the true extent of dengue infection and deaths.Public health experts warn that dengue cases could escalate in the coming days as heavy rainfall continues across the country and post-monsoons season, which is considered the main dengue season, is yet to start.“The coming days will be more challenging for us, as dengue cases could surge,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Shukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital at Teku in Kathmandu.Public health experts criticise the authorities for their narrow focus on merely counting cases and deaths, which does little to control the spread of the deadly disease.Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained from previous outbreaks are implemented.Meanwhile, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division on Friday issued new guidelines to control the spread of the dengue virus. The guidelines stress the need for searching and destroying mosquito larvae, but do not recommend insecticide spraying, as past experience shows that this measure is futile in controlling the epidemic.Officials say fogging with insecticides is only a symbolic measure and does not effectively kill larvae, pupae, or eggs, particularly if done during the day. Experts say a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts.At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has alerted all agencies concerned about the growing risk of the spread of mpox, also known as the monkeypox virus, in communities.The division’s alert follows Wednesday's declaration of a global public health emergency by the World Health Organisation. The UN agency defines an international public health emergency as an “extraordinary event” that poses a serious public health risk.“We have also asked concerned agencies and officials to step up surveillance measures and send people suspected to have contracted the virus to the National Public Health Laboratory for the test,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the division. “We also held a discussion with the representative of the UN health body in Nepal and other officials concerned about the potential risk of the mpox virus spreading.”Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. It is the second time since the UN health body declared mpox a global health emergency in two years, as the virus has spread alarmingly in the African continents and is at risk of entering other continents. The WHO said that 524 people died and more than 14,000 cases of infection have been reported this year alone in Africa, which exceeded last year’s figure.The mpox virus is transmitted through close contact such as sex, skin-to-skin contact, and the respiratory tract or mucous membranes.Doctors say animal-to-human transmission often occurs through bites, scratches or direct contact with infected animals’ blood, body fluids or wounds. The virus causes flu-like symptoms.Nepal had confirmed mpox infection in June last year after a 60-year-old foreigner tested positive for monkeypox infection.Public health experts say that every disease seen in any corner of the world is possible to come to Nepal due to the high mobility of its own people and foreign tourists. They say it is relatively easier for people from any part of the globe to come to Nepal and that it increases the risk of any disease seen in any part of the globe arriving in Nepal.“We cannot keep repeating the same mistake. When Covid spread in China, we thought that since we did not have a direct flight from disease-hit areas, the chance of the disease spreading to Nepal was low, but this proved to be wrong,” said Dr Shrawan Kumar Mishra, director at the provincial Public Health Laboratory of Madhesh Province. “Many people from our country travel to Africa, and our UN peacekeepers also serve there and return home. Anyone coming back from disease-hit countries must be kept in isolation for three weeks.”Experts say screening at the health desks of international airports and land crossings alone is not enough to prevent a possible outbreak of monkeypox in the country since symptoms usually appear between five and 21 days after infection. Moreover, not everyone will have visible symptoms on their skin or limbs. They say that asymptomatic persons can also transmit the virus.Symptoms of the mpox virus include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it. Doctors say that even though monkeypox infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the authorities concerned should not underestimate the risks.Globally, more than 87,000 cases and 112 deaths from monkeypox were reported in 2022, according to the WHOThe UN health body said it is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers on potential vaccine donations and coordinating with partners through the interim Medical Countermeasures Network to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools. \nAmid a surge in new coronavirus cases in the country, the Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to roll out a Covid vaccine across the seven provinces.Officials said that elderly people, those with compromised immunity, and children between five and 11 years will be jabbed with the monovalent coronavirus vaccine supplied by the COVAX facility last month.“Most of the provincial health offices have already placed demands for the vaccine,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We will start supplying vaccine doses to provinces within a week.”The monovalent or single component vaccine is designed for the Omicron sub-variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Lately, Nepal has witnessed a rise in coronavirus cases. The World Health Organisation’s report on integrated influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance for week 31 of 2024 shows a SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 13.68 percent in Nepal. Also, the latest data from the National Public Health Laboratory indicates a sharp increase in cases. Of the 5,373 tests conducted since January, 341 came out positive for Covid. The test positivity rate is 6.3 percent, which is concerning, according to experts.Doctors say that the number of people suffering from fever, sore throat, body aches, and common cold has risen.The COVAX facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, supplied Nepal with 1.6 million monovalent vaccine doses in the first week of July.Officials said that around 100,000 children with underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.Along with these children, pregnant women, people with compromised immunity, those with chronic diseases, and people over the age of 55 have been designated as vulnerable groups, officials said.Since the end of the second wave of Covid in 2021, health authorities across Nepal have stopped active case finding, including contact tracing and free testing. Hospitals now only conduct tests for those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for travel abroad or for seriously ill patients with respiratory conditions. Multiple doctors the Post spoke with said that the circulation of coronavirus has never stopped and is unlikely to stop in the near future.Infectious disease experts and virologists urge the public to take precautions to protect the elderly and people with comorbidities from the deadly virus. They warn that even if most people may not show severe symptoms from Covid infection, the elderly and people with underlying conditions remain at high risk.“We saw elderly people requiring intensive care during the previous surge in April,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “It’s time to return to the basics—washing hands, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds—to save at-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic.Meanwhile, the National Public Health Laboratory said that an Omicron sub-variant of the coronavirus is responsible for the surge in new infections of late. According to the latest update issued by the laboratory, the Omicron variant has been found in all 42 swab samples in the whole genome sequencing.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe this approach could be instrumental in tracking the virus’s severity and properties.This time, however, the laboratory has not provided information about the specific Omicron sub-variant. \nAs the spread of cholera continues unabated, agencies under the Ministry of Health and Population have started discussions to explore the possibility of vaccinating the people in affected areas against the deadly disease.Officials said that health authorities concerned and aid agencies held several rounds of discussions about containing the ongoing spread of the highly contagious disease.“We have also held discussion with the officials of the World Health Organisation in Nepal about the possibility of inoculating the people in the cholera hit areas including Lalitpur,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have also planned to discuss the issue with experts from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and even death within a few hours if untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.At least 50 people from four districts—38 in Lalitpur, eight in Kailali, and two each in Kathmandu and Pyuthan districts—have contracted cholera so far this year. Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients.Public health experts said that detected cases of cholera infection could be just a tip of the iceberg, as most of the positive cases are being reported from the districts having active surveillance, including the three districts of the Kathmandu Valley and Kailali.Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Vaccines against the deadly disease were administered in Kapilvastu and Rautahat districts in the past after all efforts to contain the spread of the disease failed.Health officials concede that even if they have discussed the issue of inoculating people from the disease hit areas with anti cholera vaccine, it is easier said than done. They said that finding an anti-cholera vaccine is challenging, as production of the vaccine itself is very low. Moreover, the government has not allocated a budget for the programme.“We have also talked with representatives of the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI), which provides vaccines free of cost to Nepal,” Ghimire said. “But they told us that the chance of supplying vaccines in the near future is low. We have to prepare for cholera vaccination for next year.”Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Most of the water sources contaminated with deadly microbesOfficials at the Health Office, Lalitpur said that contamination of most of the sources of water—tap water, ground water, tanker water—is a main challenge to contain the spread of the cholera.“We have yet to check the quality of the jar water, which is widely used in offices, hotels and homes for drinking,” said Dr Bhuwan Paudel, chief of Health Office, Lalitpur. “But faecal coliform has been found in most of the samples of tap water, ground water and tanker water being used in Lalitpur.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, is found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.They say consumption of contaminated water not only can cause diarrhoeal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the risk of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.They stress that awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are crucial to protect people from water-borne diseases.A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment is required to contain the spread of infection, according to doctors.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to experts.The World Health Organisation has also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nAlthough the extent of coronavirus spread in communities remains unclear, neither health authorities nor the public see a need for more testing. But doctors and experts, including virologists and officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, say cases of coronavirus in the country are steadily ticking up.“We won’t know the situation in communities without testing,” said Dr Janak Koirala, an infectious disease expert. “But what is true is that the number of people suffering from fever, sore throat, body aches and common cold have risen of late and some might be due to Covid.”The World Health Organisation’s report on integrated influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance for week 31 report of 2024 shows SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 13.68 percent.Also the latest data of the National Public Health Laboratory indicates a sharp increase in cases. Out of 5,373 tests conducted since January, 341 came out positive for Covid. The test positivity rate is 6.3 percent, which is concerning, according to experts.“Precaution should be taken if the positivity rate exceeds five percent,” said Koirala. “But we don’t know the actual condition, as neither testing nor active case finding are being conducted.”Besides the surge in coronavirus cases, coinfection of multiple viruses including coronavirus has also been detected, according to the lab report.The report shows that swab samples of 11 people having influenza-like symptoms were found to have been infected with A(H1N1) also known as swine flu, and Covid. One sample was found to have co-infection of influenza B virus and Covid. Along with Covid, influenza positivity rate is also on an upward trend. The NPHL’s report shows that the overall influenza positivity rate is 17.1 percent, meaning that 17 out of every 100 samples tested positive for influenza viruses. Specifically, 713 people tested positive for swine flu, 47 for A(H3), also known as Hong Kong flu, and 223 for influenza B virus. Since the end of the second wave of Covid in 2021, health authorities across Nepal have stopped active case finding, including contact tracing and free testing. Hospitals now only conduct tests for those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for travel abroad or for seriously ill patients with respiratory conditions. Multiple doctors the Post spoke with said that the circulation of coronavirus has never stopped and will not stop in coming days either.Infectious disease experts and virologists urge the public to take precautions to protect the elderly and people with comorbidity from the deadly virus. “Testing and other preventive measures have stopped,” an official at the Health Ministry said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak on the issue. “But just look around: in our homes and neighbourhood, we can easily find cases of fever, common cold and people with other Covid-like symptoms.”Experts say that even if people are not getting severe from Covid infection, the elderly and people with underlying conditions remain at high risk.“We saw elderly people requiring intensive care during the previous surge in April,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “It’s time to return to basics—washing hands, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds—in order to save at-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”Experts say the overall high positivity rate suggests the virus has spread faster than expected. There could be many people with Covid who have not gone for tests, according to them.As the coronavirus symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu, many opt not to get tested, which doctors say could prove costly, because they can be carriers and could spread the virus to those coming in contact.Doctors warn that authorities’ reactive approach—taking preventive measures only after hospitals start witnessing massive patient flow could result in more severe consequences.Meanwhile, a highly placed source at the Health Ministry confirmed detection of a new sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country apart from previous variants including the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4.The National Public Health Laboratory had recently carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of 42 coronavirus-infected persons. The report is expected to be published on Tuesday.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus’s severity and properties.“The trend of previous years shows infection of influenza virus including coronavirus surge in August and September,” said Dr Ranjan Bhatta, director at the NPHL. “This surge has been seen in recent days as well. But this does not mean you should panic, only that you should take enough precautions against the risk.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love.

Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nA late goal by new signing Joshua Zirkzee earned Manchester United a nervy 1-0 victory over Fulham in their Premier League season opener at Old Trafford on Friday.Home supporters were in buoyant mood ahead of the first game of the English top-flight campaign, with four players unveiled on the pitch and new faces in the United boardroom also in attendance.Just as they did at home for much of last season, however, United struggled to break down their opponents in the first half, with captain Bruno Fernandes going closest to scoring the opener.Frustrations grew after the break, only for Dutch substitute Zirkzee to arrive right on cue three minutes from time to earn United victory.“To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn’t be better,” Zirkzee told Sky Sports.“Manchester United is a huge club. You should always strive for the best. It's all good vibes.”A smart save from goalkeeper Andre Onana kept an early curling Kenny Tete effort out while Fernandes was presented with two golden opportunities but was denied by Fulham keeper Bernd Leno.Midfielder Mason Mount handed a starting spot after an injury-ravaged first season in Manchester, went close early in the second half.More wayward passing led to groans from supporters, however, before despair turned to jubilation at the death when substitutes Alejandro Garnacho and Zirkzee combined to create the winner.United have more wins and more points from their opening games of Premier League campaigns than any other team, but this performance suggested there is still much to be done for manager Erik ten Hag.Without a Premier League title since 2013 and having addressed key problem areas in the transfer market, United supporters are expecting better than their eighth-placed finish last term. \nEverest Women’s Volleyball League on Friday announced the players and coaches of the all participating six teams for the inaugural season of its tournament.Gandaki, Kathmandu, Madhesh, Lalitpur, Karnali and Chitwan will compete in the tournament.The marquee players of the team were unveiled last week. National team captain Aruna Shahi will represent Chitwan. Other marquee players Saraswati Chaudhary, Salina Shrestha, Niruta Thagunna, Usha Bhandari and Sumitra Regmi will be competing for Gandaki, Lalitpur, Madhesh, Kathmandu and Karnali, respectively.The players have been classified into three tiers, with each team featuring one “A” grade player, four “B” grade players, and three “C” grade players. The teams are permitted to sign a minimum of three foreign players each, while one player will be selected through a talent hunt.Jagadish Bhatta, the coach of the national women’s volleyball team who recently guided Nepal to a historic victory over India at the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League, will be at the helm of Team Kathmandu. \nAll Nepal Football Association (ANFA) on Friday shifted the group stage fixtures of the SAFF U-20 Championship football tournament to the ANFA Complex in Satdobato due to poor condition of the Dasharath Stadium. The championship is set to begin on Sunday.The country’s football governing body decided to change the venue of the tournament after SAFF match commissioner Abdul Hameed Abdul Ghafoor, after an inspection, deemed the Dasharath Stadium unfit to host matches.The Dasharath Stadium was originally scheduled to host all SAFF matches. “The match commissioner inspected the football grounds at both the Dasharath Stadium and ANFA Complex on Friday. After the inspection he told us that Dasharath Stadium is unprepared for hosting the SAFF championship,” ANFA Spokesperson Suresh Shah told the Post.Abdul Ghafoor, a Maldives national, arrived in Kathmandu on Thursday evening.ANFA released the fixtures of the Championship, rescheduling all the group fixtures at the ANFA Complex. The semi-finals and finals of the Championship will be held at the Dasharath Stadium, ANFA said in a statement later in the evening.Nepal will face Sri Lanka to kick off the SAFF U-20 on Sunday.The poor management of pitch of the country’s only international-standard football stadium drew public criticism on Tuesday when Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda’s Paro FC and Martyrs Memorial A-Division League champions Church Boys United played their AFC Challenge League qualification playoff match in a muddy and puddled pitch, following an afternoon rainfall.The stadium was hosting Paro only days after the Asian Football Confederation found the ground good enough to host international matches.ANFA Vice President Deepak Khatiwada on Wednesday insisted that the responsibility to maintain the Dasharath Stadium’s ground should return to ANFA, further stressing that no games other than football should be organised there.The Council took over the responsibility of the ground after Nepal was forced to move their second round matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers to neutral venues in March, after the AFC representatives deemed the ground condition unsatisfactory.The stadium is also scheduled to host SAFF Women’s Championship 2024 in October. \nIndian medical professionals started a 24-hour shutdown of non-emergency services across the country on Saturday in protest against the brutal rape and murder of a doctor in the eastern city of Kolkata.The shutdown, which began at 6 am, will cut off access to elective medical procedures and out-patient consultations in the world’s most populous nation, according to a statement by the Indian Medical Association.Casualty departments at hospitals, which deal with emergencies, will continue to be staffed.A 31-year-old trainee doctor was raped and murdered last week inside a medical college in Kolkata where she worked, triggering nationwide protests among doctors and drawing parallels to the notorious gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012.Anger at the failure of tough laws to deter a rising tide of violence against women has fuelled protests by doctors and women’s groups.“Women form the majority of our profession in this country. Time and again, we have asked for safety for them,” IMA President R. V. Asokan told Reuters on Friday.More than a million medics were expected to join the strike. \nDucking as mortar fire exploded around them, Rohingya refugee Mustafa Kamal and his family narrowly escaped the attack by a rebel militia on their town in western Myanmar.Crowds had gathered on a small island to seek shelter after witnessing killings in the coastal town of Maungdaw, he said, but “many died on the spot”, including one of his nephews, Noor Sadek.Others crawled and swam to reach neighbouring Bangladesh, he said.His family are among many Rohingya, members of a persecuted mostly Muslim minority, who fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state in recent days, as fighting escalates between the troops of the ruling junta and the Arakan Army, the powerful ethnic militia that recruits from the Buddhist majority.Reuters was not able to determine how many Rohingya had crossed into Bangladesh, where close to a million Rohingya live in refugee camps outside the coastal town of Cox’s Bazar.But medical charity Medicines Sans Frontières said its doctors had treated 54 people for violence-related injuries in recent days, 40 per cent of them women and children.“We were seeing lots of gunshots, shrapnel, mortar shell injuries, all indicative of indiscriminate,” Orla Murphy, the group’s Bangladesh representative, told Reuters. “They were life-threatening trauma wounds that we were treating.”The influx of refugees, who will have to stay with relatives, stretching resources, will make food supplies scarce, said the representative of a panel of displaced Rohingya.“They are suffering from an extreme food crisis,” added Kamal Hossain, chairman of the panel. “The government and camp authorities should arrange their food.”Many dozens of Rohingya, including a heavily pregnant woman and her two-year-old daughter, were killed last week in drone attacks in Maungdaw that three witnesses said were carried out by the Arakan Army, Reuters reported.The rebel group and the junta blamed one another for the attack. Several boats carrying refugees to Bangladesh were sunk, killing more, Bangladesh media said.The latest wave of attacks, including the burning of a Rohingya town by the Arakan Army in May, is the biggest surge in violence against the Rohingya since a 2017 Myanmar military-led campaign that the United Nations said was carried out with genocidal intent forced more than 730,000 to flee to Bangladesh.‘FIGHTING FOR LIFE’Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, a Bangladesh refugee relief official based in Cox’s Bazar, said Rohingya had been seeking safety in increased numbers since the drone attack but did not say how many had crossed the border.“I have heard that many dead bodies are floating across to Bangladesh and a humanitarian crisis has occurred across the shore in Maungdaw,” he said.Bangladesh is in no position to accept more Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, the South Asian nation’s de-facto foreign minister, Mohammad Touhid Hossain, told Reuters on Thursday, asking neighbouring India and other countries to do more.Hossain also called for more international pressure on the Arakan Army to stop the attacks on the Rohingya in Rakhine state.“But when someone arrives with a bullet injury, fighting for life, or a pregnant woman arrives fighting for life, we are not that inhuman that we will turn them away,” Bangladesh’s Rahman said.The United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, said it did not have information on the number of Rohingya who had crossed into Bangladesh.Another man who fled his home with his young family, Mohammed Saber, said about 60 people were killed in his village when the Arakan Army raided it, among them his two-year-old nephew, Mujibul Hasan.They paid traffickers to take them by boat to Bangladesh but the ship came under attack, which killed dozens aboard, he said.The family is now sheltering with an uncle, but Saber has no money. He needs to buy medicine for his children.“I will do whatever it takes to keep my family alive,” he said. \nNegotiators were to meet in Qatar again on Friday seeking a Gaza ceasefire agreement that could help avert regional escalation, end a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, and free Israeli hostages held by Hamas.The latest round of talks between Israel and mediators began on Thursday and was expected to resume on Friday after noon prayers. Mediators have said they are briefing Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is not taking direct part in the talks, on developments.“This is vital work. The remaining obstacles can be overcome, and we must bring this process to a close,” U.S. national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House.Months of on-off talks have so far failed to overcome fundamental divisions, with Israel saying peace will only be possible if Hamas is destroyed, and Hamas saying it will only accept a permanent, rather than temporary, ceasefire.Overnight, Israeli forces pounded targets across tiny, crowded Gaza and issued new orders for people to leave areas it had previously designated as civilian safe zones, saying Hamas had used them to fire mortars and rockets at Israel.The conflict began on Oct. 7 when Hamas fighters rampaged into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and seizing around 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has reduced much of the territory to rubble and killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israel says it has eliminated 17,000 Hamas fighters.REGIONAL FEARSIn a statement late on Thursday, Hamas politburo member Hossam Badran said Israel’s continuing operations were an obstacle to progress on a ceasefire.The Israeli delegation includes spy chief David Barnea, head of the domestic security service Ronen Bar and the military’s hostages chief Nitzan Alon, defence officials said.The White House sent CIA Director Bill Burns and U.S. Middle East envoy Brett McGurk. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egypt’s intelligence chief Abbas Kamel are also taking part.The negotiations are taking place in the shadow of a feared regional escalation, with Iran threatening to retaliate against Israel after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31.With U.S. warships, submarines and warplanes dispatched to the region to defend Israel and deter potential attackers, Washington hopes a ceasefire agreement in Gaza can defuse the risk of a wider war.Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday he had told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during their last meeting in July to quickly end the Gaza war, but the former president also criticized ceasefire demands.“He knows what he’s doing, I did encourage him to get this over with,” Trump told reporters at a press conference on Thursday. “It has to get over with fast. ... Get your victory and get it over with. It has to stop, the killing has to stop.”Netanyahu’s office and Trump both separately denied on Thursday an Axios report that said they had spoken the previous day about Gaza ceasefire and hostage release talks.The White House meanwhile said attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian civilians in the West Bank were “unacceptable and must stop” after dozens of settlers assaulted a village, killing at least one person. \nAn association of Indian doctors called for more than a million colleagues nationwide to provide only essential services on Saturday, in a protest over the brutal rape and murder of a medic that is set to be the biggest such strike in recent times.Anger over the crime showed no signs of dying down a week after the 31-year-old doctor was found dead on a blood-soaked mattress in the medical college where she worked in the eastern city of Kolkata.She had settled down for a short nap on a carpet in a college lecture hall after working for nearly 20 hours of a 36-hour shift, staff at the R G Kar Medical College told Reuters.Anger at the failure of tough laws to deter a rising tide of violence against women has fuelled protests by doctors and women’s groups.“The emotions are different this time,” R V Asokan, the president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the largest grouping of practitioners, with 400,000 members, told Reuters.“Women form the majority of our profession in this country. Time and again, we have asked for safety for them.”Late on Thursday, the IMA called on practising doctors in India, a figure it estimates to exceed a million, to shut down all services nationwide, except emergency departments, for 24 hours from Saturday morning.Political parties, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in the opposition in the state of West Bengal, whose capital is Kolkata, said they would hold protests in the city on Friday.Bollywood actors, other celebrities and politicians have voiced shock at the crime, calling for stricter punishment for perpetrators.A low-earning police volunteer, designated to help local police officers and their families who needed to be admitted to the hospital, has been arrested and charged with the crime, but protesters say that is not enough.Doctors say the circumstances of the rape highlight the vulnerability of medics left without proper protection and facilities.Tougher sentences were among sweeping changes made to the criminal justice system after the 2012 gang-rape of a 23-year-old student in a moving bus that sparked similar protests and outrage, but campaigners say little has changed since.The health ministry issued guidelines on Friday setting a six-hour deadline for the heads of state-run hospitals and medical colleges to report incidents of violence against health care workers. \nIn 1932, Juddha Shumsher Rana built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, which housed diverse animals from Nepal and abroad, including tigers, rhinos, deer, monkeys, birds, and possibly a lion.\nUnauthorised translations of popular books, including those by Taslima Nasrin, are rampant in Nepal, despite copyright laws prohibiting such practices, leading to poor quality translations and harm to authors and readers.\nOne of the first group experiments of Nepal Studies in the mid-20th century came in the form of a research collective which was later named Samsodhan Mandal. It was founded and led by the late Naya Raj Pant (1913-2002). Pant had studied Siddhant Jyautisa (astronomy) with Padmakar Dvivedi and others in Banaras for about six years during the 1930s. A key text that had greatly influenced him during this period was Bhaskara’s Siddhantasiromani, a 12th-century text. Dvivedi was interested in ancient history and tried to inculcate that interest in his pupils as well. According to Pant, he used to meet with his guru outside of school hours to learn history and other things. From the mid-1930s, Pant started studying the history of Nepal. After returning to Kathmandu in 1938, he came into contact with Baburam Acharya (1888-1972) who gave him old documents to study. Later he came into contact with Sardar Rudra Raj Pandey (1901-1987) who facilitated a six-month research stint for him in the Guthi Office.Pant writes, “From all these [interests and connections], I learnt a bit about Nepali history. When I found mutually contradictory statements [stories] in the history written by foreigners, I began to lose my respect for them. I [then] decided to progressively revise the history of Nepal.” In 1941, Pant was hired by the Ranipokhari Sanskrit Pathashala to teach Jyautisa. From around the same time, he is said to have immersed himself in the further study of Sanskrit grammar and Kautilya’s Arthasastra. Starting from the early 1940s, Pant started a private Pathashala in Kathmandu to train students in Sanskrit, Jyautisa and history. What was his vision then? In Hamro Uddesya ra Karyapranali, a text said to have been written around 1957 but published only in 2002, Pant wrote, “A century has passed since we started taking English-style education. We know first-hand that we have been (mostly) unable to learn work-effective knowledge, or when we have managed to do so, it has not succeeded in our country and produced good results. Now is not the time to remain idle. There is no other way but to rejuvenate our own ancient knowledge. Even though it might require great perseverance and a lot of time, we have to do research on our knowledge and advance it further; we have to maintain our own traditional experiences, and find our own path/method. Only if we manage to do this will we be independently able to make our country more prosperous....It is with this belief that we are engaged in studying-teaching Sanskrit education to rejuvenate our knowledge. The Sanskrit Pathashala has been opened for this purpose.”Just as one founder of the Nepal Sanskritik Parisad (estd 1951) had highlighted the need to cultivate self-identity to shed the cultural dependency on Europe, Pant stressed the need to rejuvenate traditional Sanskrit education as the highway for Nepal’s prosperity. Regarding the particular modality of his Pathashala, in an article published in 2014, historian Yogesh Raj has suggested that Pant had been “impressed by the strict Gurukul-style teachings of an obscure Pandit Genalal Chaudhary” whom he had encountered in Banaras.Pant’s Pathashala adhered to some fundamentals as integral to the process of training as a historian. These included mastery of Sanskrit, palaeography and epigraphy, rote memorisation of some key texts, and rectification of factual errors committed by other historians based on source criticism. When enrolling at the Pathashala, the students had to pledge that they would not use it as a ladder to subsequent education in foreign languages. The guardians of the students also had to sign another piece of paper saying, “From the bottom of my heart, I believe that great knowledge can be attained and livelihood earned even when one does not study English or other foreign languages.”In Pant’s Pathashala, mastery over Sanskrit was given great priority. In the words of his son and disciple Mahes Raj Pant, this enabled the students “to have independent access to many a discipline from the whole range of Sanskrit literature.” Rote learning as part of the ‘traditional method’ was a fundamental tenet of the senior Pant’s training while he was a student, and he replicated this method in his own Pathashala. Recitation of specific texts from memory was how gradual competence was demonstrated in this school. Being able to critically edit old documents and texts of inscriptions and write commentaries on them was another part of the training. The projected time-period to master the skills emphasised in this school was a total of eight years.Following the guru’s command, the students in Pant’s Pathashala mostly invested their academic energies into doing research on the history of Nepal. This work began to thrive after the Rana regime ended in 1951. Its members started to publish pamphlets of Itihas-samsodhan (Amendments of History) from 1952. In the words of Mahes Raj Pant, “In those pamphlets the students pointed out with documentary evidence the errors committed by the so-called scholars in dealing with the history of Nepal. That work of the group attracted a lot of popular attention at the time. Some of the Ithihasa-Samsodhana pamphlets contained harsh words to shock those who were incompetent to write the history of Nepal….The task of the group helped to highlight various aspects of Nepalese history and gave a fresh impetus to the reconstruction of a correct and complete history of Nepal.” In these pamphlets, Mandal students deployed what Raj has called “multi-layer source criticism.” Their “rule of evidence” was “primarily about sustained engagement with the fidelity of evidence and often solely that.” At its largest, the Mandal’s Pathashala had 32 students out of which 21 were involved in the history samsodhan work. However, by the time the Samsodhan Mandal got officially registered in the early 1960s, only ten, including the guru, remained. One member of the group, Gyanmani Nepal (1933-2024), had already graduated by then and returned to his home in eastern Nepal to start a similar Pathashala. Several others had quit the group for various reasons.By the end of the 1960s, the Mandal’s scholars had generated a corpus of booklets including several dozen ‘Amendments of History’. A consolidated and revised collection of 50 such ‘Amendments’ was published in 1962. They had also published a series of Shavadhan-patras, challenging the published work of various scholars and cautioning them against unethical academic practices such as not acknowledging the published work of the Mandal scholars. They had also published several volumes of primary documents, including 12 issues of the quarterly Abhilekh-sangraha, some critically edited historical texts, and over 20 issues of its quarterly journal Purnima (estd 1964). By 1970, the Pathashala had trained individuals such as Dhanavajra Vajracharya (1932-1994), Gyanmani Nepal, the late Shankar Man Rajbanshi, Gautamvajra Vajracharya, Mahes Raj Pant, and several others as historians. Several members of this Pathashala went on to make significant contributions in history-writing of Nepal. They provided us with a relatively secure knowledge of the chronology of the successive ruling dynasties of Nepal from the Licchavi period to the Shah dynasty, made public various types of new historical documents and other sources and set exacting standards for evidence-based history-writing. The main bulk of their contributions fell under the domain of political history, but some of them also made significant contributions to a broader social history. Articles in the essay form and length were the preferred outputs of the members of this school, and interpretive historical narrative of the monograph length was not their strongest mode of written output. Writing in 1984, one of Mandal’s members, Mahes Raj Pant, stated, “The greatest contribution of this group was that it inspired the natives with the idea that given proper education, we can carry on research, and we ourselves are competent enough to reconstruct our past.” In the assessment of Yogesh Raj, the work of the Mandal contributed to “epistemic diversity” in historical knowledge production in post-Rana Nepal. Raj adds, “Mandal scholars took evidence as resources whose rigorous criticism would lead to a true and ‘scientific’ knowledge about the past.” Samsodhan Mandal’s Pathashala was plagued by financial problems from its very beginning. After an initial phase of great activity in the 1950s and 60s, it could not find the means to retain its students and reproduce itself in intergenerational terms. By the time of the death of its initiator, Naya Raj Pant, in November 2002, the school had been reduced to the guru and his two historian sons, Mahes Raj and Dines Raj Pant. While talking to a journalist in the immediate aftermath of the demise of the senior Pant, his two sons described their father’s attempt at an alternative to formal university-based education and degrees as a “failure”. The senior Pant and his sons have often said that, among other reasons, the antagonism of those whose work had been amended by the Mandal’s students led to the downfall of its Pathashala. In their view, given that those who were ‘attacked’ in its pamphlets were powerful members of Nepal’s intellectual elite, the latter conspired to disband the Pathashala. While there is no doubt that those whose works were ‘amended’ were mostly not pleased to have been put under the Mandal’s scanner, the idea of them getting together to conspire against the Pathashala’s institutional longevity is a bit hard to digest. The Pathashala initially succeeded because the pupils mostly adhered to the utopian visions of the guru Naya Raj Pant and participated in his experiment as his disciples. However, as they gradually became expert historians in their own right and had to earn a living to support their families, discordance between the fiscal needs of the pupils and the school’s inability to generate an income to keep it running became all too apparent. The school never had a system whereby the pupils were expected to pay regular fees to take lessons. In the early decades, the guru supported his family with his salary from the Ranipokhari Sanskrit Pathashala, and its scholars occasionally got some stipend from various sources (including Nepal Sanskritik Parisad) to critically edit historical texts. As part of their remit as trainees, the older students also tutored the younger ones in the Pathashala. Following the establishment of Tribhuvan University in 1959, university-credentialed individuals began to find jobs in new state, para-state and private institutions. By the early 1970s, the intergenerational transfer of knowledge began to be mediated by more complex institutions supported by the state and market forces. Hence, the Mandal’s Pathashala model and the vision of which it was a part, began to look less attractive to those who were already its members and to younger folks who were its potential members. When the late Dhanavajra Vajracharya, one of the Mandal’s most competent and committed members, quit it and joined TU in 1971, the attraction of this Pathashala was surely on the decline.  In the context of the immediate post-Rana Nepal, the experiment that was Samsodhan Mandal Pathashala was important because it established a firm tradition of Nepali historical scholarship based on a critical reading of the evidence. This school demonstrated what could be achieved through a commitment to a kind of historical scholarship that had been in practice in scholarly traditions in different parts of the world until the mid-20th century but mostly absent in Nepal. We should also note that the Pathashala was a home-grown effort that relied on the collaboration of several individuals for its success and for at least a few decades, its work provided one model of how Nepal Studies could be done in Nepal.  \nState intervention has made a comeback. States have, in one way or another, always intervened in markets to develop specific industries and push innovation. But there has been a renaissance since the 2010s, in particular with respect to industrial and trade policy.There are many reasons for this. The fallout from the global financial crisis in 2007–08, increasing geopolitical tensions, and efforts to strengthen domestic manufacturing in the wake of supply chain disruptions are a few of the leading factors.Alongside the comeback of state intervention, experts are chiming in on what state-led growth strategies should look like. They highlight different things, but one piece of advice is recurring: These strategies need to incentivise exports and shy away from protectionism.Governments are right to focus on exports. But the story about protectionism is more complicated. In fact, in most cases of successful industrial and trade policy, a push for exports has been combined with elements of protectionism.South Korea and Taiwan are good examples. These countries transformed their economies from low-income to high-income at lightning speed, needing only 30 years to do so (from roughly 1960 to 1990).They achieved this feat through meticulously crafted policies, and export-orientation was a key feature. In a speech in 1965, the South Korean president, Park Chung-hee, called exports “the economic lifeline” of the country. But protectionism was equally important.Emergency tariffs were often imposed on items with excessively high import growth. In addition to this relatively visible measure, a range of “covert” protectionist measures were used. For example, a number of special laws on most imports almost invariably meant that import permission had to be obtained from a public agency.An array of taxes not specified as tariffs were also often imposed when attempts were made to import non-essential items such as golf clubs, whisky and French wine. They were frequently labelled as an education tax, a defence tax, or simply a “special” tax.In Taiwan, protectionist policies featured more explicitly than in South Korea. In the mid-1970s, almost half of the items in the tariff schedule still carried import tax rates of over 40 percent.And, like in South Korea, Taiwan applied a range of non-tariff barriers. These included the tying of import licences to export performance, restrictions on which countries imports could come from and who could import them, and “approval” mechanisms for import control.The latter essentially meant that, for firms wishing to import certain products, a reference check had to be made to make sure that domestic suppliers could not meet the would-be importer on price, quality and delivery.A path well litBy using protectionist measures to avoid excessive import growth and shield domestic firms from competition, South Korea and Taiwan were not doing something supremely novel.In fact, the most protectionist country throughout history is the US. It had the world’s highest average tariff rates on imported manufactures throughout the 1800s, a period that saw the country transform into a global economic powerhouse.China in the 1990s and 2000s is another prime example of incorporating protectionism into the design of industrial and trade policy. However, it was a form of protectionism that looked slightly different.China relied heavily on attracting foreign investment into manufacturing, which was done strategically by nudging multinationals to form joint ventures with Chinese state-owned enterprises. This increased the probability of technology transfer and, in time, of replacing imported products with those produced in China.Overall, China’s state-led industrialisation strategy has been hugely successful. Practically all manufactured products today can somehow be traced to a production process in China, and the country dominates many global industries.While protectionism may be essential to successful economic development, a few issues still need to be addressed.First, protectionist measures like tariffs have no guarantee of being successful. The 1950s and 1960s, for example, saw governments across Africa and Latin America protect domestic firms from outside competition. The intention was to develop a domestic industrial base, but the firms largely failed to become competitive on the world market.That said, export subsidies (and state intervention more broadly) have no guarantee of working either. Does this mean we should ditch all state intervention? Of course it doesn’t. All state intervention—including protectionism—can fail, but without any state intervention failure is a guarantee.One way to think about the practice of industrial and trade policy is that it’s like venture capital: All policies should be evaluated like a portfolio, within which a small number of successful bets will pay for all the failures.Second, can all countries be protectionist at the same time? Probably not, and this is why people worry about trade wars. In fact, we are seeing this unfold at the moment between China and the US.In a world where nation states can retaliate against one another with things like tariffs, and as long as economic competition between firms and nation states remains a central part of how the global economy is organised, the playing field for economic competition needs to be made level.Right now, it isn’t level. It vastly favours the wealthiest and most powerful countries, and the multinational corporations based within them.This is why, in international trade agreements, lower-income countries should be allowed more space in their design of economic development policy—including, but not limited to, protectionist policies.Simply put, countries that are lagging technologically should be granted a larger policy toolbox. This would give lower-income countries a better chance of catching up with high-income countries. And if we are to take one lesson from economic history in this respect, it’s that protectionist policies have been vital for catching up.Hauge is assistant professor in Development Studies at the University of Cambridge.-The ConversationRead the original article here. \nWith the Paris 2024 Olympics concluding earlier this week, Nepali players have returned home. All seven athletes returned empty handed, having failed to break the 60-year spell of participating in Olympics without winning a medal. Those scratching their heads as to why Nepal has had a dry run all these decades needn’t look further than the Dasharath Stadium, located at the nerve centre of Kathmandu. The country’s most famous stadium was a sight to see on Tuesday. Nepal’s Church Boys United lost to Bhutan’s Paro FC, which was a shock for Nepali fans. But the match result was hardly a topic of discussion on Tuesday evening. Rather, it was the ground of the country’s only international-standard stadium hosting an international match. It was a messy affair on the ground as the 22 boys jostled for the ball, slipping on the puddled, muddy ground all the time. As the Nepali players struggled to clinch a win against the visiting team, the photographs circulating on social and mainstream media, of the players drenched in sludge, gave an early indication that Nepal was set to lose an image war internationally. The Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda, a member of the Bhutan squad, was right on point when he called the Bhadrakali ground a joke. It’s not clear whether Nepali authorities have taken Honda’s remark as an insult to Nepal or ignored it completely, but Honda, who has played three world cups for Japan, should be thanked for pointing out our pathetic state. The tamasha at the stadium exposed the state of our sports infrastructure and the insincerity of our authorities even when it comes to organising an international event.Alarmingly, the situation is no different in cricket, volleyball or martial arts. Nepali youths have tremendous interest and potential in sports, in addition to a fan base envied by the world. Impressed by our young talents, the international sports fraternity has shown unprecedented interest towards Nepal in recent years. But the authorities remain as lethargic as ever even to cash in on the international goodwill.There is no dearth of literature on the lackadaisical attitude of Nepali sports authorities. But there are some basics they should do immediately if Nepali sports is to get any better. First, the authorities must work to strengthen the financial security of the players. Only then we can expect better results from them. If the sportspeople are playing for the country, it is the country that should look after their needs. The prime ministers, ministers and other officials who compete to make big announcements after a Nepali team’s win in an international match should learn to walk the talk.Second, the authorities should work immediately to improve sports infrastructure. If the Dasharath Stadium is muddy, the Kirtipur Cricket Ground has no light. The Mulpani Cricket Stadium has taken decades to complete, and there are hardly any decent stadiums outside the capital city, and players are deprived of training and international exposure. The authorities must therefore ensure that the sports bodies strictly follow a calendar of events throughout the year from federal to the grassroots level to ensure a holistic development of the sector. If we continue to make the players dodge the sludge on their training ground, we cannot expect them to return home with international medals.  \nIndia’s new foreign secretary Vikram Misri returned to New Delhi on Monday after a 32-hour whirlwind tour around Kathmandu. Not much was expected of the visit, as it was supposed to be a courtesy call, a continuation of the tradition of Indian foreign secretaries visiting neighbouring countries after their appointment. So there were no significant breakthroughs in outstanding issues—just an exchange of pleasantries and congratulations over chiya-kaffee. A rendezvous with no agenda is a good thing once in a while—after all, neighbours can’t just engage in geopolitical hard talk all the time. However, here’s wishing the visiting dignitary had some time to step out of the prime ministerial and presidential chambers onto the streets. For the monsoon-battered, puddled roads reflect reality better than the glossy floors of Baluwatar and Sheetal Niwas. Having recently seen a diplomatic whodunnit in Bangladesh, Indian Babus would certainly want to touch base with ground reality in the neighbourhood.Nepal and Bangladesh have different political contexts, including in terms of parliamentary politics. Having faced Sheikh Hasina's seemingly tight grip on state affairs for over a decade and a half, Bangladeshis were fidgeting for a change as democracy was on the wane. With 13 government changes in 16 years, Nepal remains committed to democracy although Nepalis are looking for a change, seeking stability. India remained tight-lipped on the goings-on in Bangladesh even as Hasina sought a fourth consecutive term this January by keeping opposition leaders behind bars. Apart from being the biggest trade partner in South Asia, Bangladesh was a “friendly” nation to India, thanks to Hasina’s indebtedness to India from 1971 all the way to 2024. As long as the person of its liking was in power in Dhaka, India chose to remain silent to the calls for democracy, free press and fair elections in Bangladesh, only to jolt back to reality when the tide of change swept Hasina off her feet, and the comfort of dealing with a friendly ruler in the neighbourhood became a thing of the past.Luckily for Misri, things are not too bad in Nepal. But when was the last time a top Indian diplomat spoke about the report of the Eminent Persons Group that is collecting dust due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reluctance to so much as acknowledge it? When will India acknowledge Bhairahawa Airport as Nepal’s major development infrastructure and provide the air space for it to operate fully? And when will the Babus in New Delhi’s North Block stop using the language of Nepal, a supposed backyard of India, being taken over by China? When Misri returns to Nepal for a definitive diplomatic visit, he would want to come up with some fresh ideas and spend a bit more time to understand the subterranean tides of change. Nepal might have been ruled by old leaders milking their legacy of the 1990s politics when Misri was still a young foreign services officer in India, but the old Indian lenses used to look at Nepal now need replacing.  \nIt’s not a good sign for people to start questioning a government’s anti-corruption credentials barely a month after its formation. Yet they have choice but to do so with the government seemingly intent on giving a free pass to many corrupt officials and leaders. As per a bill currently under discussion in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of Parliament, a corruption case should be filed within five years of the knowledge of such an instance of corruption. (It is unclear who should have such knowledge.) Similarly, if an individual had been involved in corruption while being in a public position and could not be punished at the time, they too should be punished within five years of retirement. In fact, the bill was first registered by the then KP Sharma Oli government on January 20, 2020. It was passed and sent to Parliament on April 10, 2023. With Oli back in power, the bill, which is supposed to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2059 (2002 AD) has now again come to the centrestage. The bill presented by the Oli government seems to have been inspired by a “forgive and forget” approach to corruption. It is so indefensible that even the MPs from the ruling parties are struggling to do it. Lawmakers of the opposition Maoist Centre and Rastriya Swatantra Party have also rightly pointed out that the deadline of five years is regressive. As it stands, the UML is the sole party in defense of the bill. If the other parties, both ruling and opposition, stick to their guns, the government will have to back down, and it should. For there is absolutely no rhyme or reason for the five-year cap; and were such a cap to be imposed, countless current and former politicians and bureaucrats who are soaked in corruption would walk scot-free. Nepal already ranks an alarming 108 of the 180 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2023—below fellow South Asian countries Bhutan (26th), the Maldives (93rd) and India (93rd). Moreover, the conviction rate in corruption cases in 2021-22 stood at just 38.5 percent. If there is one thing the government should do at this time, it is to bring policies to reduce corruption and punish the corrupt with due diligence. However, it seems to want to take the opposite route.From instances of money laundering to land grabbing, selling diplomatic passports to turning citizens into refugees, corruption is widespread in Nepal. No political party is free from corruption, which is also exemplified by recent investigations into high-level politicians in the Lalita Niwas land grab scam, the gold smuggling scams, and the Bhutanese refugee scam. There is ample evidence of how no corrupt country can steadily move forward on the path of peace and prosperity. This is why, fighting corruption should be the top agenda of all big and small political parties that purport to work in national interest. Those who don’t do so deserve to be singled out and punished for doing irreparable harm to their country.  \nThe luxurious new life of Pushpa Kamal Dahal is an antithesis of his younger days when he took up arms for the sake of the marginalised and downtrodden sections of society. As the leader of a bloody insurgency that claimed nearly 17,000 lives, Dahal has always had a legion of detractors. But when he first came out of the jungles to join mainstream politics, he also had a lot of public support, as was evident from the 220 seats his party won in the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The Maoist tally was double the number of the second-placed Nepali Congress, as the party got nearly 30 percent of all cast votes. By the time of the 2022 national elections, it had to be satisfied with 32 seats and just around 14 percent of the votes. The reason for this steady erosion in the party’s electoral support is clear enough. Primarily, it is a reflection of Dahal forgetting his roots. He is today no different to the ‘crony capitalists’ of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML he once blamed for all the country’s woes. There is now not a ‘progressive’ bone in his body. Yet following his ignominious exit as prime minister a month ago, Dahal has been in a hurry to put together a progressive alliance of socialist and left-learning forces. He is already in the four-party Socialist Front which, besides the Maoist Centre, also has as its members the CPN (Unified Socialist), the Nepal Socialist Party and the Communist Party of Nepal. The Maoist chief wants to further expand the collaboration between such like-minded forces. Moreover, his Maoist Centre party has announced a new nationwide campaign whereby it will go to people’s doorsteps to explain the party’s agendas and to get feedback. The feedback is likely to be angry. The party has long since abandoned its principled advocacy on behalf of women, Dalits, Janjatis and other marginalised communities—the groups that were its core voters. As things stand, on the right of the political centre in Nepal there is the Congress while the UML occupies the left of the centre. The people disenchanted with both these outfits are plumping for new forces like the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Janamat Party. Where in this political spectrum does today’s toothless Maoist party fit, one wonders. People won’t also be fooled by the formation of so-called leftist and socialist fronts. Dahal seems to remember his once core constituencies only when he is out of power. Disenchantment against him is growing, even within the Maoist Centre. After a long while, other party leaders are openly criticising his undisguised lust for power, most evident in his oscillation between the Congress and the UML just so he could occupy the prime minister’s chair. Some, like Narayan Kaji Shrestha and Janardan Sharma, have asked him to make way for a new leader. If Dahal is serious about reviving his party’s fortunes and leaving behind a credible legacy, he should be the one to make the biggest sacrifice. The options before him are limited. Gone are the days his gift of the gab alone could change people’s hearts and minds.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe weather on Saturday is forecast to be generally cloudy throughout the country.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of all provinces.Tonight the weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country.
