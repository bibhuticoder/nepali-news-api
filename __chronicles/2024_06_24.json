Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nCIAA charges sitting Chief Secretary Baikuntha Aryal and 11 others in a Rs386.7 million corruption case related to excise duty sticker printing irregularities, suspending Aryal from his position.\nA king cobra bite in Sindhupalchowk highlights the migration of venomous snakes to hill and mountain districts due to rising temperatures caused by climate change, prompting concerns over increased snakebite cases and the need for expanded treatment centers and awareness campaigns.\nDespite severe period pain, 19-year-old Ekta's concerns were dismissed as normal, leading to delayed diagnosis of endometriosis, a debilitating condition often ignored due to the normalization of period pain.\nMonsoon rains have caused floods and landslides in Jajarkot, Panchthar, Lamjung, and Sankhuwasabha, claiming several lives, displacing families, and disrupting transportation.\nAmidst government controversy over ambassadorial recalls, Nepal's PM Dahal's Delhi visit aimed to enhance bilateral ties, expedite trade agreements with India and China, and promote BRI projects, facing challenges in implementation but highlighting the importance of economic diplomacy and regional energy trade.\nThe National Budget endorsement in the House of Representatives was obstructed by protesting Parliament staff demanding overtime allowances, leading to the formation of a government committee to resolve the issue.\nThe issue of jurisdiction that has cropped up in the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives across the country is nothing but a distraction to take the attention away from the main agenda. According to Sishir Khanal, a committee member from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), it is unclear whether a committee formed by the federal Parliament can investigate the cooperatives that come under the jurisdiction of the provincial and local level governments. Khanal and the RSP are clearly fishing for a legal loophole to absolve the party chair and current deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane of the crime of routing money from various cooperatives into the Gorkha Media Network. There is documentary proof of money from at least four cooperatives being pumped into the network at a time Lamichhane was its managing director. Some of these cooperatives fall under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. Khanal said the committee should work in a way that no legal questions can later be raised over its final recommendations. This is a flawed argument. A bit of context is warranted.The committee was formed after the main opposition, Nepali Congress, disrupted parliamentary proceedings for nearly two months, demanding that Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperative scam, particularly in relation to the Gorkha Media Network, be probed. After long negotiations, it was agreed that a parliamentary committee would indeed be formed and while the committee’s ToR would not mention Lamichhane, it would name the network. The fourth point of the committee’s ToR mentions that it will “study the status of the funds transferred to various organisations, including Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd, whether the funds were obtained legally or illegally, and how the funds were put to use will be conducted.” Legal experts the Post talked to were of the view that though many cooperatives may be operating under local or provincial laws, the federal government can regulate them, and as such the probe committee should have no problem in this regard. They point to the country’s constitution which gives the federal government the mandate to regulate all cooperatives.Here, we must again remember that the committee’s ToR mentions that all those entities from which funds have been transferred to the Gorkha Media Network will be probed. No distinction is made between the cooperatives that fall under the jurisdictions of various levels of government. Moreover, the committee had to be formed in order to meet the opposition’s central demand that the involvement of a sitting deputy prime minister and home minister in such an egregious crime be investigated. This is also why the name of the now-defunct media company he was once involved with is mentioned. As the seven-member probe committee has only three months, they should be working full time in determining those responsible for misappropriating hundreds of billions of rupees of common people. As a part of this process, the committee’s task will also be incomplete if it cannot either clear or implicate Lamichhane over the transfer of various cooperatives’ money into the accounts of a private media company. \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \nOverhead bridges often become hangout spaces where people spend time observing the hustle and bustle of the city. Even in the small and noisy traffic island of Koteshwor junction, one can observe people resting and killing time. Similarly, plenty of people visit the open land of Koteshwor-Tinkune to play sports, and many more are there as spectators.These examples indicate the growing demand and potential for public spaces in Kathmandu.Having public spaces in urban areas has multiple benefits. Open spaces improve public health by providing space for physical activity and refreshment. They make places socially and economically vibrant by attracting people and activities. They serve as emergency shelters during disasters like earthquakes. If planned well, open spaces help in biodiversity conservation and groundwater recharge. However, the situation of open spaces in Kathmandu Valley is miserable. UN-Habitat recommends 15-20 percent of urban land for open public spaces. However, according to a report published by the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority, only 2.29 percent of the land was available as open space in 2012, and the condition has not improved. The irregular distribution of public spaces has also reinforced their unavailability. Advocates for urban public spaces recommend the availability of open spaces within walking distance, a 400-metre radius. However, many places in our cities do not have public spaces nearby, and even when they are available, they are usually gated and inaccessible.Public parks are confined within high boundary walls and gates. Shielding public spaces from the public is a paradox, although it is supported by common reasonings such as possible vandalism, waste littering and maintenance difficulty. As a result, we are undermining the value of public spaces.Similarly, unifunctional and exclusive planning approaches have also compromised the effectiveness of public spaces. Public parks designed for specific demographics, such as elderly people’s and children’s parks, have become a new trend. When this is not the case, the spaces still lack provisions for a diverse population: Women, children, differently abled and so on.Furthermore, ecological dimensions are rarely considered during the development of public spaces. Local hydrology, geology, biodiversity, and natural ecosystems are disregarded. Approaches like the plantation of non-native vegetation for mere beautification, a large proportion of hardscape, and the absence of stormwater management systems show a superficial approach to public space management.In addition to these issues, open spaces constantly threaten encroachment. Sometimes, encroachments seem like an act of conservation but end up with the controlled ownership of some individuals or groups. The Nepal Army’s occupation of part of Tundikhel is one such example. At other times, public spaces are intruded by building construction and infrastructural development. Despite all such challenges, urban public spaces can be enhanced in many ways.First and foremost, existing and potential open spaces should be identified; larger parks, khya (culturally significant open lands), urban pockets, riverfronts, traditional ponds, courtyards and other potential spaces should be mapped out and planned for. Encroached public lands should be reclaimed. As for new urban areas, the government should provide open spaces beforehand.After that, identified public spaces should be managed, with due consideration of their typology and context. Larger parks can be developed with a significant proportion of native greenery and diverse spaces such as sports areas, recreational areas, water bodies, and gardens. Basic services like public toilets and drinking water services should be arranged.Smaller spaces can be designed as urban green pockets. Machhindra Park near Jawalakhel is one good example. Cultural-communal lands such as Khya should be managed with minimal interventions.Riverside landscape can also be capitalised as urban public spaces. Some riverside parks, such as Sankhamul Park, have already demonstrated the use value of riverfronts. However, the custom of retaining wall boundaries and ornamental landscape disassociates the river’s relationship with the land and people. Therefore, riverside development that promotes biodiversity and ecological sustainability and strengthens people’s physical and spiritual relationship with water is essential.Next, we can capitalise on traditional open spaces like ponds and courtyards. For instance, ponds can be revitalised with proper pavements, seating spaces, and safety. Pim Bahal Pukhu at Patan and Nigu Pukhu at Thimi are perfect examples of traditional pond-based revitalisation that boosted the place’s socio-economic activities.Furthermore, creative strategies are required to transform unconventional spaces such as overhead bridges, sidewalks, bus stops, and traffic islands into appealing public spaces. For instance, a pedestrian bridge, beyond its functional use of crossing roads, can act as a lively space if upgraded with public space amenities. Greenery addition, shed, carved-out spaces for interaction, seating spaces, and artworks are a few strategies. Likewise, wide sidewalks can be transformed into green infrastructure networks constituting rest spaces, kiosks and drinking water fountains.Lastly, the most important step in public space management is to embrace the ‘Make it Simple’ design approach. This will significantly help tackle the issues of maintenance challenges, budgetary limitations and environmental degradation. Barrier concepts should be replaced with design and management solutions to resolve public space maintenance issues. Too many interventions and high-maintenance elements such as fountains, extravagant lighting and furniture can be intentionally avoided. Simple open ground composed of local vegetation, seating platforms, and minimal hardscape with durable materials like stones can also make beautiful parks. Providing open spaces is not enough in itself, though. For example, the Dharahara complex, although designed as a landmark public space, isolates itself from the surrounding context. Ultimately, public spaces should be physically well interconnected with existing urban networks to make them more accessible, practical, and contextual. \nNepali art exhibitions held in May-June 2024 at Kathmandu’s major galleries represent the diversity of the idioms of Nepali paintings executed in traditional, ethnic and modern forms. Visiting the exhibitions, closely observing the artworks, and interacting with the curators and some artists, I realised that the quest for the right idioms to express the major motifs of paintings continues to be the main thrust of the artists. In this article, I am alluding to the genre of paintings exhibited in galleries. I have attempted to review the paintings displayed at the exhibitions and briefly discuss the diverse modalities and practices of exhibitions, as well as the impact of audience-oriented activism. Though I have been writing on the diverse genres and forms of Nepali art like sculpture, architecture and installation-oriented works mainly curated in Nepal by Sangeeta Thapa through major events under such rubrics as “biennale and triennale”, I have mostly produced reviews of paintings over the decades. I have put my review writings in catalogues and journals. In recent years, I have been writing articles on art for the academic journal Sirjana of the Sirjana College of Fine Arts. Navindra Man Rajbhandari, an artist, art teacher, curator, and pedagogue, has been working earnestly to edit and publish this journal. I visited the painting exhibitions in the major galleries—two at the Nepal Art Council, Babarmahal and one each at the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts and the Siddhartha Art Gallery. Interestingly, all these exhibitions are audience-oriented. The painting exhibition practice often follows the rituals of cataloguing the works with simple introductions and price tags written somewhat half-heartedly. They also mention the mediums used by the painters, like oil, water, gouache and, very commonly, acrylic. From the early artists who were exposed to Western art to those of contemporary times in Nepal, all use the same mediums as artists anywhere in the world. These mediums are the universal shapers of the idioms of paintings. Nepali painters use the above-mentioned mediums and other admixtures according to their modern training and indigenous painting traditions. The evolution of colour paintings, especially oil, marks the presence of the audience or the clientele of paintings; it has become a commonly recognised subject. All came through modern education in art. Artists’ emotions and the consonance of cultural and aesthetic factors are commonly represented in such paintings.One eloquent example was seen at an art exhibition, “Deities of Nepal II”, held at the Nepal Art Council in May-June 2024. This exhibition, principally curated by the art academic Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, presented some remarkable paintings and their projection modalities. The diversity of the paintings executed according to the overt and covert themes of sacrality had one common element. Their choice of colours and hues and their delineation to create the exquisite beauty of the mythopoetic figural of the characters in the paintings was one eloquent feature. Modern painters also treated the divine figures and their aura in their non-figural works. I especially liked the modern techniques in these paintings about the deities. The thrust was experimental. Some artists, comparatively, made very good paintings; others were just cliché works, naturally. However, the common strength and feature of all the paintings that featured the iconography was what the brief brochure text says: The composition of “the deities intricately woven into a tapestry of philosophical and spiritual beliefs.” The other was the search for an appropriate style for projecting the spiritual motifs. The paintings appeared to establish a covenant with the audience, this time through a pricing pattern. Paintings were liberally priced; some were priced up to Rs4 million. And the remarkable matter was that some of these expensive paintings were “sold” to Nepali buyers. We should remember that the paintings were sold as works of art, not as pictures of religious iconographies. The entry of the modern audience into Nepali paintings is what matters here. John Berger, a great art critic, says that the painting itself should generate the buyer’s desirability through its touchable and visual attraction. I saw this covenant at this exhibition. The next display was the “National Exhibition of Fine Arts 2024”. This one presents a different perspective in my collection several decades’ glossy catalogues of the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts. This exhibition, curated by Devendra Kumar Kafle, aka Thumkeli, its member secretary, and other departmental academy members, presents a unique view of Nepali art. Kafle guided me through the variety of artworks and described the collection methods. The collection is based on the modality of sampling artworks of Indigenous and regional features and bringing them out to the national exhibition, which is a remarkable activity. The Academy has published small glossy catalogues for them. In his note, the Chancellor of the Academy, Naradmani Hartumchali, says this is a culmination of such exhibitions in all seven states. He stresses the need to bring art to a level where indigenous forms could be made a topic of political significance by evoking such features as representation and social transformation. I don't know of any well-researched discussions on this important topic initiated by any authentic institutions. But the exhibition speaks for itself. The current exhibition, “Threads of Simultaneity”, organised by ‘Sirjana 2024’ and mainly curated by Navindra Man Rajbhandari, exhibits 200 pieces of artwork executed by 28 artists at the Arts Council. Artist Rajbhandari revealed that the exhibition was an attempt to project a historicity of a combined nature of art activity shared entirely by the academic cohort of the institution. The exhibition features some works of the erstwhile principals Sashi Shah (2001-11), Krishna Manandhar (2011-17) and Madan Chitrakar (2018-22), and members of the Sirjana College of Arts like Vatsa Gopal Vaidya and other senior artists associated with the college one way or the other. Works of the young and senior artists are on display. I also want to recall yet another unique exhibition organised by Siddhartha Art Gallery, “Sawari Kathaharu: Art in Motion”, in May 2024. The concept of motion in art is presented by creating the art of motion, as in Ralph Lily Turner’s “Storms”, Hokusai’s “Great Waves”, Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica” and Sashi Shah’s “Darting Horses”, to take a few examples. Capturing the fixed images mounted on darting objects like vehicles and exhibiting them in a reputed gallery is designed to showcase experimental works and their appeal.May and June 2024 were eventful in the realm of Nepali art. I was struck by the variety of motifs and styles that show the performative mode of Nepali paintings. \nSouth Africa held their collective nerve to edge West Indies by three wickets under the Duckworth-Lewis method in a rain-disrupted shootout for a semi-final spot at the Twenty20 World Cup in Antigua on Sunday.The unbeaten Proteas joined England in the last four as Group 2 winners when Marco Jansen (21 not out) smashed a six down the ground off the first ball of the final over to get South Africa to their adjusted target of 123.Left-arm spinner Tabraiz Shamsi had earlier taken 3-27 as tournament co-hosts West Indies were restricted to 135-8 before the rainstorm swept in to stop play.Spinner Roston Chase (3-12) took three wickets late in the South African innings to set up a dramatic finish and give a glimmer of hope that West Indies might keep alive their quest for a third title.The other two semi-finalists will be decided on Monday when India and Australia meet in St Lucia and Afghanistan take on Bangladesh in St Vincent in the last two matches in the Super Eight stage.The South Africans won the toss and elect to bowl first in a decision that was quickly vindicated when danger men Shai Hope and Nicholas Pooran were dismissed inside the first two overs with just five runs on the board.Kyle Mayers, brought into the West Indies squad as an injury replacement on Saturday, steadied the innings in a partnership of 81 for the third wicket with Chase.Both had some fraught moments — Chase was dropped on 11 and Mayers survived an lbw call on review — before Shamsi separated them in the 12th over when Mayers slashed the ball to Tristan Stubbs at deep cover point to depart for 35.That was the last partnership of note in an innings of fits and starts, Chase (52) and Sherfane Rutherford (0) falling victim to Shamsi’s wrist spin, and Andre Russell thumping a couple of big sixes before being run out for 15. West Indies knew they were under-par and needed a big bowling effort and Russell gave them a great start.He struck with the first delivery of the innings to remove Reeza Hendricks caught behind down the leg side before having the other South Africa opener, Quinton de Kock, caught at backward square leg for 12 five deliveries later.The crowd at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium came to life but any momentum the West Indies had built was lost when the skies opened immediately and play was delayed for 90 minutes.Stubbs and his skipper Aiden Markram resumed on 15-2 and took the tally to 42 before local quick Alzarri Joseph struck with his second delivery to remove the latter for 18.Joseph’s pace did for Heinrich Klaasen (22) in the eighth over but the other West Indies bowlers were proving expensive and the South Africans were now just a run-a-ball away from their target.Chase came on in the 12th over to bowl David Miller for four and then sent back Stubbs (29) and Keshav Maharaj (2) and ensure the chase went into the 17th and final over. \nA third-minute goal from Christian Pulisic set the United States on their way to a 2-0 victory over Bolivia in their Group C opener at the Copa America on Sunday.Folarin Balogun added the second shortly before half-time and while the tournament hosts pushed for more goals in the second half they were unable to add to their tally.“The message to the team is it’s always important to win your first game,” US coach Gregg Berhalter said.“We talked about progressing our performance, improving our performance throughout the tournament, so I think it was a good starting point.”The US were aggressive right from the start against Bolivia, who have just one win in their last 31 Copa America matches.A missed opportunity by Balogun in the first 20 seconds was soon forgotten when Pulisic scored a spectacular goal from the edge of the box, beating Bolivian keeper Guillermo Viscarra.It was Pulisic’s 30th goal in 69 international matches. His first came against Bolivia in May 2016.The US doubled their lead in the 44th minute when Pulisic found Balogun and the striker ended his six-match goal drought in international matches with a low shot into the bottom corner.The hosts continued their onslaught with Ricardo Pepi, who came on as a substitute in the 65th minute, denied four times by Viscarra.“We tried to recover but of course, after the goal in minute three, it all went down the hill,” Bolivia coach Antonio Carlos Zago told reporters.“We should have competed a bit more, but we need to be aware that we had the host team in front of us. They are a strong national team and I am really happy with the effort made by the players.”The US next face CONCACAF rivals Panama on Thursday in Atlanta, while Uruguay will take on Bolivia in New Jersey. \nToday, the weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki will likely experience heavy rainfall in the hilly regions. At the same time, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning has also been forecast to occur across the country.The weather will remain the same until later tonight.Stay indoors as rainfall is expected to continue in all seven provinces with Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki likely to experience heavy rainfall.Monsoon has brought some much-needed respite to the scorching heat as temperatures have begun to cool down across the country. Dhangadi’s maximum temperature rose to 38.8 degrees Celsius while Jomsom recorded a minimum temperature of 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nHungary snatched a 100th-minute winner to beat Scotland 1-0 and put themselves in contention for a last-16 spot at the European Championship while condemning the Scots to yet another failure at a major tournament.Kevin Csoboth’s breakaway goal with almost the last kick of the match ensured Hungary finished third in Group A with three points while Scotland, yet to reach the knockout phase of either the Euros or World Cup, end in last place on two points.Hungary must wait to see whether they will qualify for the last 16 in one of the places reserved for the best four third-placed finishers.Their progress now rests on results from other groups going their way over the next three days. However, for now Marco Rossi’s side will revel in their dramatic victory that rescued their hopes just as they thought they were heading home.“It was unbelievable. We never achieved nothing in the past without big, big suffering. Today was no different. I think that we played the match that we needed to play,” Rossi said.“We created many options, many situations. We also left some (chances) to them. But overall, I think if I say that it was a deserved win, I’d be right,” he added.The match was a scrappy affair, with both teams struggling to exert any kind of control despite each being desperate for a win to continue their stay in Germany.Steve Clarke’s Scotland did dominate possession in the opening 25 minutes but could not fashion any clear-cut chances. Indeed, they had no shots at all in the first half despite having 61% of the ball. They ended the match without a shot on target.Hungary, meanwhile, grew into the game and began threatening on the break and making quick transitions, with captain Dominik Szoboszlai in particular threatening from set pieces.The midfielder’s freekick to the far post in the 41st minute was met by an unmarked Willi Orban but his poor header clipped the top of the bar from close range.Che Adams had Scotland’s first shot shortly after the break but he blasted it over.HORROR CLASHThe game was paused for a lengthy period in the 68th minute after a horrible clash between Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn and Barnabas Varga from another Szoboszlai freekick.Varga appeared to be knocked out cold and needed urgent treatment, and Hungary players erected blankets around him as a screen while they looked in distress, with Szoboszlai in tears.The forward was carried off the field on a stretcher to applause from the crowd. He was taken to Stuttgart Hospital, the Hungarian Football Federation said, adding that he was in a stable condition.“That gave us that extra bit, obviously we don’t ever want to see that on a football pitch but thankfully he’s conscious now,” Hungary midfielder Callum Styles said.Scotland had a strong appeal for a penalty dismissed in the 79th minute when substitute Stuart Armstrong ran on to the ball in the box but fell under contact from Orban. However, the referee did not consider it a foul.The game become more chaotic as both teams sought a winner.Gunn did well to save from Szoboszlai’s shot at the near post in the first minute of stoppage time, while Csoboth struck the post a minute later from the right when bearing down on goal.Scotland rushed forward and McTominay slid in at the near post to meet a low cross but the ball missed the target.It was from a Scottish corner that Hungary turned into a rapid counter-attack up the pitch. A long cutback across the box fell to Csoboth who slotted the ball in, sending Hungary fans delirious and players from their bench running over in celebration.Scotland could only look on dejected as their bid to make history ended in dramatic fashion to the latest goal ever scored at a European Championship in regulation time.“Tonight’s devastating, the lads are absolutely gutted. Yeah but it’s up to us to pick them up and that will happen slowly but surely,” Scotland captain Andy Robertson said.“But thank you to the country because we felt everyone behind us, and we knew the excitement back home—sorry for letting you down.” \nPrivate dairies have requested subsidised loans from the government to settle farmers' dues, amounting to nearly Rs3 billion, amid the ongoing dairy sector slump.They have also requested the government to permit them to export dairy products such as powdered milk, butter, and cheese, as consumption within the country has remained subdued. As a result, the stock has been piling up. Recently, the government partially bailed out the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation by providing Rs300 million in soft loans. After dairy farmers started protests, officials privy to the matter told the Post that the government is preparing to release another Rs600 million to the corporation. The corporation had in February said that the dairy industry was suffering from a recession and hoped that sales would increase in summer. But it didn’t.Both state-owned and private dairy companies said that the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for months.“We are unable to pay farmers due to unsold products. The stock, too, is huge,” said Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association.“So we have requested the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development to provide a soft loan keeping our dairy products as collateral. We have also requested the government to open up exports so that we can sell our products and become able to pay the farmers.” The association is scheduled to meet the agriculture minister on Monday. “We hope that our request will be heeded,” said Dahal. The association has requested a soft loan for more than 50 percent of its remaining stock. Private dairies have stocks of powdered milk and butter worth Rs5 billion, said Dahal.According to the association, the committee formed by the agriculture ministry to study the payment issues of dairy farmers found that around Rs4.50 billion is due to be paid by dairies to the farmers. The amount was previously Rs7 billion.This shows that payment is being made gradually, Dahal said. “But that is not sufficient.”Consumer demand for milk and other dairy-related products declined last year, with the government hiking the price of raw milk to benefit and encourage more dairy farmers to join the sector. However, the unscientific hike hit demand amid the people's declining incomes due to the economic slowdown.Regarding price reduction to increase consumption, Dahal said private diaries have a high cost of production, so it will not be possible to reduce the price.The government also imposes VAT on dairy products like ghee, ice cream, and cheese. “If the VAT is waived, prices will come down, which can boost the sales,” said Dahal.According to the association, nearly 1 million litres of milk comes from the formal sector, which implies a daily transaction of Rs70 million.“If the soft loan is provided and export is permitted, we will be able to clear all the farmers' dues by September,” Dahal said.Dairy entrepreneurs said that the butter stock is gradually being cleared, and milk production has declined, balancing stock and output.Last Wednesday, dairy farmers demonstrated outside the Lainchaur-based Dairy Development Corporation, demanding immediate settlement of their outstanding payments. Police arrested dozens of dairy farmers during the protest.Around 50 farmers were arrested as they attempted to picket the corporation. According to the association, 600,000 families are associated with the dairy sector, contributing 45,000 jobs. More than Rs60 million cash flows from urban to rural areas daily, and the government collects revenue of more than Rs2 billion monthly.“The agriculture ministry has called us for a meeting on Monday,” said Amar Bahadur Kunwar, president of the Central Dairy Cooperatives Association. “Both private and government dairy industries have more than Rs5 billion in dues to be paid to dairy farmers.”Dahal said the state-owned corporation alone has outstanding dues of Rs2 billion to the dairy farmers.The corporation even issued a public notice on June 10 inviting bids to sell its butter and powdered milk. As per the notice, it planned to sell 200 tonnes of butter (15kg block) and 300 tonnes of skimmed powdered milk (25kg bag).In another notice on Sunday, the corporation fixed the skimmed powdered milk rates. The country currently produces more than 6 million litres of milk daily. The corporation purchases around 25 percent of it. \nSummaryHosts Germany top Euro 2024 Group A after 1-1 drawSwiss forward Ndoye gave his side a first half leadFuellkrug equalised for Germany in the 92nd minuteSwitzerland are also into the last 16 as runners-up in Group AStriker Niclas Fuellkrug scored a dramatic stoppage time equaliser as hosts Germany rescued a point after a 1-1 draw with Switzerland on Sunday to seal top spot in Group A and maintain their momentum going into the last-16 of Euro 2024.Swiss forward Dan Ndoye had threatened to spoil the party with a first half opener, but Germany, who had already sealed a knockout place before kickoff, are now on a seven-game unbeaten run stretching back to November and kept plugging away until the equaliser eventually came through Fuellkrug’s header.The home side had a goal disallowed and several penalty appeals rejected by Italian referee Daniele Orsato, and it looked to be a frustrating night before Fuellkrug finished one of their 18 attempts at goal in a feverish atmosphere in Frankfurt.It denied the Swiss what would have been a second win over Germany in 22 competitive matches dating back to 1959, but their passage through to the last-16 is also secure.Germany top the pool with seven points from their three games, two ahead of Switzerland, while Hungary (three points) must wait to see if they will advance as one of the best third-placed teams following a 1-0 win over eliminated Scotland (one).“Of course, we would have liked to win the game and to play great football,” Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan said. “But I think you also need games like that during a tournament. And that can also be a real strength for the next games, hopefully.”Germany thought they had the lead on 17 minutes when Robert Andrich’s shot from 30-yards somehow beat Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer at his near post but the latter’s blushes were spared when the goal was ruled out for a foul by Jamal Musiala.Instead it was the Swiss who scored just before the half-hour mark. Musiala was bundled off the ball in midfield and when Remo Freuler was found on the left-hand side of the box, his low cross was turned into the roof of the net by Ndoye.The home side created numerous chances as they camped in the Swiss half, but after Kai Havertz had wasted several, Fuellkrug rose highest to head in David Raum’s cross in the 92nd minute and preserve their unbeaten start to their home championship.“I think when you see the Germans celebrating, we can be proud of ourselves,” Swiss captain Granit Xhaka told SRF. “It’s not easy against a team like that. Nevertheless, the late equaliser hurts.“Everyone fought for each other and ran for each other. We have to push ourselves to the limit. Then we can beat anyone. We have taken the first step and are now looking forward to the round of 16.”Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann picked the same starting XI for the third game in a row, but will be forced into at least one change for the last-16 after Jonathan Tah picked up a second yellow card of the group stages and will be suspended.Whether Havertz did enough to keep his starting place remans to be seen, with Germany looking more threatening when Fuellkrug came on to score his 13th international goal in 19 caps, only six of which he has started. \nPace bowler Chris Jordan celebrated his return to the England side with a hat-trick on Sunday in the land of his birth to set the defending champions up for a crushing 10 wicket victory over the United States and a place in the T20 World Cup semi-finals.After dismissing the United States for 115 from 18.5 overs in their final Super Eight group match, England captain Jos Butler (83 not out), who effortlessly lofted five sixes in an over off left-arm slow bowler Harmeet Singh, and Phil Salt (25 not out), stroked their way to 117 without loss from 9.4 overs.After being asked to bat first, the United States lost their last five wickets in six balls.Jordan, who had replaced Mark Wood, began the 19th over by having Corey Anderson caught at long-on by Harry Brook. Two balls later he clean bowled Ali Khan, then trapped Nosthush Kenjige lbw and bowled Saurabh Netravalkar to complete his hat-trick, all three falling without scoring.Jordan finished with four for 10 from 2.5 overs following another masterclass in wrist spin from Adil Rashid, who was named man-of-the-match.Rashid took two for 13 from his four overs, including the prize wicket of captain Aaron Jones who was bowled for 10 completely misjudging a googly which spun back to hit his stumps.Nitish Kumar top-scored with 30 and former New Zealand all-rounder Anderson struck some belligerent shots late in the innings but it was all far too little too late on an excellent batting surface at the Kensington Oval.“Very nice to do this at a special place like this,” said Jordan. “I thought we worked out the conditions well. Rashid came on and controlled one end and the way Livi (Liam Livingstone) bowled set the game up.”After Butler won the toss and opted to field first Andries Gous flicked the fourth ball from left-arm paceman Reece Topley’s first over for a six over the fine leg boundary but was caught for eight attempting a similar shot from the final delivery.Jofra Archer, also representing England in the country of his birth, opened from the other end, conceding a six when Kumar was late on his hook shot and the ball took the top edge and flew over the third man boundary.A more authentic shot from Topley’s second over soared over long-on for another six.Left-arm paceman Sam Curran took over from Archer and struck with his third ball, dismissing Steven Taylor caught at point by Moeen Ali for 12, his 50th ODI wicket.Rashid then bowled Jones and at the halfway stage the American side were precariously placed at 65 for three. They were never to recover as Livingstone, with his mixture of wrist and finger spin, was almost as effective from the other end, capturing one for 24 from his four overs.“I thought if we could bring our intensity we’d be too good,” Butler said. “We’ve got great options, we wanted to bring Chris Jordan back, he adds a bit of depth with his batting capabilities as well. A world cup hat-trick is a great effort.” \nSushil Pyakurel, the ambassador nominee to South Korea, has declined the position. Pyakurel has sent a letter to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, requesting the withdrawal of his nomination.In a statement on Sunday, Pyakurel said he had submitted a letter to the Office of the Prime Minister requesting the government to withdraw his nomination.Pyakurel said he rejected the post because he was not consulted before the nomination, and the government did not consider the criteria set by previous governments.“I am surprised by the government’s practice of not having prior discussions on the background, efficiency, interests, and knowledge of the political, economic, and social status of the country concerned before assigning the responsibility of a post representing a country, such as an ambassador,” Pyakurel said in the statement. “In this context, I see the need for serious discussion on the criteria set by previous governments regarding the appointment of ambassadors, the rationale behind parliamentary hearings, and the tenure of ambassadors.”The Cabinet meeting on Friday had recommended ambassadors for eight countries. Former member of the National Human Rights Commission, Pyakurel, was recommended for South Korea, according to the Cabinet decision. Pyakurel, who also served as an adviser to the second President of the country, Bidya Devi Bhandari, was supposed to replace Jyoti Pyakurel Bhandari. \nIsraeli tanks advanced to the edge of the Mawasi displaced persons’ camp in the northwest of the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Sunday in fierce fighting with Hamas-led fighters, residents said.Images of two Israeli tanks stationed on a hilltop overlooking the coastal area went viral on social media, but Reuters could not independently verify them.“The fighting with the resistance has been intense. The occupation forces are overlooking the Mawasi area now, which forced families there to head for Khan Younis,” said one resident, who asked not to be named, on a chat app.More than eight months into Israel’s war in the Hamas-administered Palestinian enclave, its advance is focused on the two areas its forces have yet to seize: Rafah on Gaza’s southern tip and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre.Residents said Israeli tanks had pushed deeper into western and northern Rafah in recent days, blowing up dozens of houses.The Israeli military said it was continuing “intelligence-based, targeted operations” in the Rafah area and had located weapons stores and tunnel shafts, and killed Palestinian gunmen.The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad movement said their fighters had attacked Israeli forces in Rafah with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs and pre-planted explosive devices.Elsewhere, an Israeli airstrike killed eight Palestinians in Sabra, a suburb of Gaza City in the north, and another strike killed two people in Nuseirat in central Gaza.The military said it had struck dozens of targets throughout the Strip.On Saturday, Palestinian health officials said at least 40 Palestinians had been killed in separate Israeli strikes in some northern Gaza districts, where the Israeli army said it had attacked Hamas’s military infrastructure. Hamas said the targets were the civilian population.In Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, health officials at Kamal Adwan Hospital said a baby had died of malnutrition, taking the the number of children dead of malnutrition or dehydration since Oct. 7 to at least 30, a number that health officials say reflects under-recording.Israel’s ground and air campaign in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute. \nLocal governments start registering victims of conflict-related sexual violence, drawing objections over legality and confidentiality concerns, despite plans for compensation and support amid ongoing neglect by state authorities.\nNepal-India relations, rooted in the Treaty of Sugauli, have remained complex due to geopolitics, geoeconomics, and Nepal's strategic autonomy, with India cautious about altering the existing structure and Nepal focusing on development and cooperation while navigating border disputes and trade imbalances.\nThe day I met Rima (name changed), it was already late morning and she was anxious. There were around seven women in a small room. She rocked nervously and reiterated that she did not want to talk. We told her she did not have to. An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rima’s body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rima’s house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rima’s quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepal’s decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepal’s conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepal’s history.Devi Khadka’s story had haunted me for years. I’d read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known ‘feminist’ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, it’s easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, “I’ve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.” Yet, some from Nepal’s transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her “political” and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. I’ve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, she’s been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepal’s transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as well—a way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepal’s transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepal’s wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal player—not a victim any more, but a leader—will strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist.

Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. “With this latest development, the process will now move ahead.”He said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. “Following their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.” The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say. Some ministers held their positions for long enough but were not bothered about pushing the bill.The bill could not be registered as Parliament was prorogued several times in the past.As a result of the delay, passengers who died in the Yeti Airlines plane crash in January 2023 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees.The Yeti Airlines tragedy in Pokhara was Nepal’s 104th crash and the third biggest in terms of casualties.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, more than 900 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.The biggest air accident took place on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Earlier, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.Nepal’s domestic airlines—nine fixed-wing operators and 12 helicopters—flew 4.15 million passengers in 2023. \nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Following the trip spanning over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites, the Post presents a travel guide to Sri Lanka. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nAnanda Mohan Bhattarai served as a justice of the Supreme Court of Nepal from August 2016 to June 2024. Before his tenure at the Supreme Court, he held positions as a judge in various district and high courts across Nepal. Bhattarai is also the author of four books focusing on law and environmental issues.In a conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Bhattarai discusses the interplay between law and literature, his reading habits, and book recommendations for aspiring lawyers.How is law and literature related?Law and literature share an intrinsic relationship. From an academic perspective, jurisprudence, often known as the philosophy of law, includes both fields of law and literature. A saying goes, “Asal faisala asal sahitya ho,” (True judgement is true literature). The ones who are adept in language have been able to become luminary judges. One example is the former Chief Justice of India, VR Krishna Iyer. He had an English literature background.While law is not entirely an open-ended discourse like literature, from a literary perspective, it can sometimes exhibit open-ended qualities. The flexibility in interpretation from a literary perspective allows for changes in legal decisions over time. This is why certain legal decisions may evolve or change as perspectives and contexts shift.How did you start reading?When I became a literature student, my love for literature developed. I have a special inclination for the works of acclaimed poets such as Hari Bhakta Katuwal and Ashesh Malla. My upbringing also deepened my love for reading. My brother and I used to recite Bhupi Sherchan’s poems, and my mother would recite Satyakli’s verses. It was a tradition to read the Ramayana every day in the evening as well.I was also fascinated by the works of William Shakespeare and Francis Bacon. Among Nepali writers, the works of Samrat Upadhya and Manjushree Thapa’s ‘Forget Kathmandu’ have left an impression on me. Why should law students read?Reading is crucial to establishing a conceptual clarity of any subject matter. After one develops conceptual clarity, it becomes easy to analyse the matter. For instance, when one becomes well-versed in the subjugation caused by patriarchy, it becomes easier to dissect the issue within the legal framework. A few years ago, the issue of women’s right to parental property sparked significant debate, with some arguing against granting these rights. However, when viewed from the perspective of rights and through the lens of the jurisprudence of equality, such debates become clearer and more justified. Therefore, reading and studying these perspectives greatly benefits law students.How do you manage time to read? When you have a demanding job, it is difficult to find the time to read. Your workload keeps you from relishing leisure activities. However, for me, there has always been a drive to read books beyond my field of expertise.I believe time does not come in blocks, instead, it flows continuously and is experienced moment by moment. Thus, even if I get an hour or so off from work, I use it to read books.Has reading influenced your perspective when making judicial decisions? I have relied on information in many books, which have shaped my case decisions to some extent. One such influential book is ‘Hiti Pranali’ by Padma Sunder Joshi. The book’s well-researched content provided me with a deeper understanding of the environmental and cultural aspects of the Kathmandu Valley's water system. Similarly, Amartya Sen’s ‘Development as Freedom’ and ‘Theory of Justice’ have provided a practical framework for judicial decisions.Which book has had the most impact on you? Literary theories helped me understand jurisprudence from a philosophical angle. Stanley Fish’s reader-response theory and the writings of Jacques Derrida have significantly shaped my thought process in the legal field.What would you suggest to young lawyers?I encourage young lawyers to consider both jurisprudence and constitutional law as essential courses and to read extensively on these topics. Additionally, human rights law is an emerging field with many new areas to explore. Studying this field helps humanise the law, making it easier to become a judge by offering fresh perspectives. For instance, understanding that “rape is not just a crime; it is an attack on the dignity of a human being” allows us to see people as human beings and respect their dignity.When studying constitutional Law, we integrate human rights and constitutional law within the framework of rights. A strong foundation in these subjects, along with good research skills, helps law students develop an effective approach.In our evolving system, which values comparative law, it is important to engage with various streams of thought rather than focusing on just one.Ananda Mohan Bhattarai’s Book recommendations: Nepali Kanuni Itihas ko RuprekhaAuthor: Rewati Raman Khanal Publisher: Pairavi Book HouseYear: 2002Rich in information and shedding light on Nepal’s political, social, and cultural dynamics, it is an insightful account of events that unfolded during the Rana regime.

Dal Bahadur’s wife and three children fell ill and are receiving treatment at a hospital. The Chepang family consumed mushroom curry on Saturday evening that they had collected from a nearby forest.  \nIt’s been 10 days since Upendra Yadav got reelected Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal) chair unopposed from the party’s general convention held in Janakpur.Nearly two weeks since the inauguration of the convention and the election of the party chairman, the JSP-Nepal, however, hasn’t elected any other office bearers and central committee members so far.Incumbent chief Yadav was declared the party chair unopposed after no one threw their hat in the ring.After Yadav’s reelection on June 12, the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13, was halted saying that all other leaders would be chosen in consensus.Before the party decided to halt the election process, 23 candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons; six candidates were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for a treasurer position; and 34 leaders had filed their candidacies for seven positions of secretary.To the question of whether the leaders had deferred the election finding it difficult to pick individuals for available positions, party insiders gave multiple answers.A leader linked the leadership election deferral to the party split in the first week of May.A group of JSP-Nepal leaders split the party and formed the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission registered the new outfit on May 6.The JSP-Nepal led by Yadav on May 13 moved the Supreme Court, accusing the commission of recognising its splinter group as a party without the legal basis.Yadav, in his petition, claimed that the commission had registered the party even without the required 40 percent central members on its side. The top court has ordered the relevant authorities to stall the process until the verdict and the case is still sub judice.The uncertainty prevents the newly formed Rai-led party from expediting its activities in a formal way. Seven of the 12 JSP-Nepal lawmakers in the federal parliament and 30 of the 406 party central committee members are with Rai.The new outfit’s plan to build its organisation at the provincial and local levels is in limbo due to the delayed court process. Leaders from the new party claimed that a large number of leaders and cadres are waiting to join the new organisation. Moreover, they are planning to embrace those aspirants of top positions when they are denied posts in central bodies. Observers of Madhesh politics claimed that the JSP-Nepal was unable to complete its election process with the splinter faction eying to lure its members. However, Manish Kumar Suman, one of the aspirants for general secretary in the JSP-Nepal, denied it. He claimed that the stalled general convention process, including the selection of leaders for office bearers positions, would be completed within a week.“As per the election commission deadline, we have to complete the whole general convention process within 35 days,” Suman told the Post. “We will complete the process before the timeframe.”Some political observers say the JSP-Nepal went for the general convention only out of the constitutional compulsion. If the party really wanted to follow the democratic process, it should have allowed the election process to go forward.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates the political parties to hold the general convention at least once in five years.“Upendra Yadav has made himself the JSP-Nepal patron,” Shiva Chandra Chaudhary, a Madhesh political observer, told the Post. “He can select leaders loyal to him, having been reelected the party chairman. So he stalled the democratic process.”On the other hand, the new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—too has failed to give momentum to the party building process in the six weeks since its inception.The new outfit has gained prominence apparently with the support of the ruling coalition. The Election Commission swiftly registered the new party on May 6 with the name similar to the mother party despite legal ambiguities in the process. The JSP joined the ruling coalition immediately after its formation and supported the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government. The Rai-led party has been given a Cabinet minister and a state minister. On Saturday, when the Cabinet made recommendations for ambassadors to eight countries, two nominations went to the new outfit’s supporters. Ambassadors for Saudi Arabia and Spain were appointed in the JSP quotas. Days after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support to the government, the Rai-led JSP gave its trust vote to Dahal and it supported the government in its policies and programmes.Lawmaker Sushila Shrestha of the JSP tried to downplay the difficulties saying that they were carrying out the party’s activities quietly. “We are engaged in several activities to strengthen the newly formed party, but we are not visible in the media,” Shrestha claimed. “Next Saturday and Sunday, our party’s central committee is meeting.” Shrestha claimed that her party is stronger than the JSP-Nepal in the provinces except for Madhesh. “We have been holding the meetings of provincial committees and are working to make our presence felt in Madhesh Province too.”Though Shrestha claims there are a number of activities within the party, political observers believe that its activities are stagnant due to the case sub judice in the court. “A writ petition in the Supreme Court related to the party split has stalled the new party formation,” Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst, told the Post.Yadav has claimed the commission registered the party despite its failure to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a party split. JSP-Nepal had 406 central committee members at the time of the party split, but the splinter group only had 30 central members with it.The newly formed JSP was registered amid a legal void as the Political Parties Act 2017 was replaced by an ordinance but not revived afterwards. According to the Act, a group of dissidents can split a party and form a new one if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members and at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, leaving no legal basis for a party split. On June 9, the Supreme Court referred the dispute related to the party to the full bench. \nProtests by employees at the Parliament Secretariat have affected deliberations on the national budget.On Wednesday, eight ministers were scheduled to answer lawmakers’ concerns about the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 at the House of Representatives. However, the meeting had to be adjourned even before one minister completed his reply due to the employees' non-cooperation.The episode replayed on Thursday. Though seven ministers were scheduled to answer lawmakers' concerns, only four could respond. United under the Employee Union of the Federal Parliament Secretariat, the officials have been staging a series of protests. Starting Wednesday, they stopped working beyond office hours demanding allowances for overtime and odd hours.The agitators say they will not work before and after office hours until they are paid allowances. Office hours start at 10 am and end at 5 pm.“We will not be working extra hours without additional payment,” Govinda Belbase, chairperson of the union, told the Post. “Our non-cooperation continues.”As the protest started to affect House proceedings, Speaker Devraj Ghimire, together with Narayan Dahal, chairperson of the National Assembly, held discussions with Barsha Man Pun, the finance minister, on Thursday to address the demands. However, Pun did not respond positively.Shekhar Adhikari, Ghimire's press advisor, said the Speaker has taken the staff's non-cooperation seriously as it has hampered the House business. The Speaker has also raised the issue with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, but to no avail.Even before the formulation of the national budget, the Parliament staff had drawn the attention of Ghimire, Dahal, and Padma Prasad Panday, the general secretary at the Parliament Secretariat. Ghimire had requested Pun to increase Parliament’s budget and resume the allowances for extra work his staff performed.However, the money was not allocated in the national budget presented in Parliament on May 28, prompting the protest.Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the secretariat, said the protest has hit the House calendar. \"The deliberations in the budget are not moving as planned,\" Giri told the Post, adding that the discussions between the Speaker and the government have not yielded positive results. Parliament has less than three weeks to complete the deliberations on the budget and get it endorsed from both houses, Giri said. All the budget-related bills need to be authenticated by the President before mid-July. The new fiscal year starts on July 16.The budget-related bills are scheduled to be endorsed by the lower house on June 27, but that doesn't look possible following the protests.On normal days, meetings of the House committees were held in the morning while parliamentary meetings were conducted after 11 am. As the parliament staff have stopped working in the morning, no committee meetings have been held in the morning for days now.Parliament Secretariat staff claim that they have to work regularly before and after office hours without being paid a penny beyond their regular salary, while lawmakers get travel and meeting allowances, in addition to their salary, for attending the House and parliamentary committee meetings.Belbase said it has been three years since the government stopped paying the allowance.Belbase said that the House meetings, which generally start at 11 am, run beyond 5 pm regularly. The staff must arrive at least an hour before the meeting for preparations and stay an additional hour after the meeting.Protestors say they had been working over 10 hours a day for months without additional payment.It was an injustice to them and against the ILO Convention of 1930, to which Nepal is a party, they say.Article 3 of the Convention states, “The hours of work of persons to whom this Convention applies shall not exceed forty-eight hours in the week and eight hours in the day, except as hereinafter otherwise provided.”The allowance for government staff was withdrawn following the Covid-19 pandemic. The government resumed the allowance in some state agencies, including the Election Commission and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, but not in Parliament, said Belbase.“We are not going to compromise this time,” Belbase said. “This is a fight for justice.” \nThe news of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari renewing her party membership has become a matter of discussion in Parliament. The ninth general convention of CPN-UML held in Kathmandu in 2014 had elected Bhandari a vice-chair of the party. After Bhandari was elected the country’s President in 2015, she gave up the party membership as mandated by the constitution. She secured the second term in the presidential election following the 2017 parliamentary polls. After Ramchandra Paudel replaced her as the head of state last year, Bhandari has been relieved of duties and has been enjoying state facilities as a former President. Parliamentarians have started asking: Can a former head of state who has been enjoying state perks return to active politics? They have also demanded that the government look into the services provided to the former head of state. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Nepali Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada, who chairs the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, said the government should clarify whether former President Bhandari qualifies for state benefits after renewing her UML membership. Media reports suggest the former President renewed her membership in a political party, Khatiwada said. “After the party membership renewal, can she still enjoy state benefits?” he questioned. “What is the state’s take on this?”He also demanded the government inform Parliament about the arrangements made for the former President.The Constitution of Nepal is silent on whether a former head of state can engage in active politics after leaving office.However, this is a question of constitutional ethics, says Raman Shrestha, a former attorney general.“If we look at the examples of other countries, a former head of state does not return to active politics, let alone by reclaiming the membership of a party,” Shrestha told the Post. “It is a question of ethics.” CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Pampha Bhusal said the question of morality only applies to the one who sticks to it. “If we see the history of Nepal, we find that a person who has become the prime minister has become an ambassador and taken other responsibilities,” Bhusal told the Post. “It is a personal decision whether to rejoin active politics after serving as the head of state. Let’s not make too big a fuss about this.”However, political observers and analysts say that when a person who has been receiving state benefits for their former role returns to active politics, it raises serious questions about that person and the party that gives the membership. Nepal has yet to formulate policies on the perks and benefits to be provided to a former head of state. The current practice is for the Cabinet to decide on such perks, according to an officer at the home ministry. “The former President gets a monthly stipend of Rs50,000. Another Rs200,000 is provided in monthly house rent,” said the officer. “If the former President has a house of their own in Kathmandu and decides to stay there, they get Rs100,000 a month in maintenance expenses.” They also get security personnel. However, the ministry officer refused to disclose the ‘sensitive’ security details. Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of Nepal, claims funds for housing from the government whereas Bhandari lives in her own house. Even before retiring from presidential duties, Bhandari had decided that she would go back to her own house, fuelling speculations about her plan to return to active politics. Bhandari is the widow of the late communist leader Madan Bhandari, who provided the ideological line to the UML. Most of Nepal’s major communist forces, the Maoist Centre led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the CPN (Unified Socialist) led by Madhav Kumar Nepal acknowledge the role of Madan Bhandari in advancing the communist cause in the country.UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, Nepal and Dahal have once been together in a single political party after the 2017 elections. Whenever the communist forces form a coalition, as the three parties are doing now, the issue of their strategic partnership comes up.The Nepal Communist Party (NCP), as the unified force was called, saw a split when Dahal and Oli jointly chaired it but Oli is often criticised for being chiefly responsible for the unified party’s failure given his leadership style. Now when the three forces are rumoured to be planning to contest the 2027 elections on the same side, the chances of former President Bhandari returning to politics to potentially unite the parties as a leader acceptable to all are said to be high.Bhandari reportedly renewed party membership on the Nepali New Year day, more than two months ago. Madhav Dhungel, the secretary of the central organisation department of the UML, took to social media on June 18 to clarify the issue. “There is no doubt that Bhandari became President as a UML leader. But then she had to distance herself from the party, and she did so,” reads the facebook status of Dhungel. “However, she has the right to provide guardianship to the whole country, the Nepali people and the political party that she nurtured.”“Whether to return to active politics is a personal matter. If she [Bhandari] does so, she won’t do so on the sly,” Dhungel writes. “If she desires to be active in politics, she will undoubtedly do so in the UML.”On the question of Bhandari renewing her party membership, Kashinath Adhikari, the head of the party’s central organisation department, said he was not in a position to give a definite answer. “Membership in our party is renewed at the start of the [Nepali] new year,” Adhikari told the Post. “Who all have renewed party membership will be known only after going through the final list of those doing so in the given time.”  \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Thursday expressed his deep frustration over the low attendance of lawmakers and senior party leaders during his question and answer session in the House of Representatives.While low attendance in the House is not uncommon, as per the tradition, almost all lawmakers and senior leaders, except those with urgent commitments, are present when the prime minister speaks in the House or organises a question-answer session on contemporary issues.“The absence does not undermine the post of prime minister, it undermines the lawmakers themselves,” said Prime Minister Dahal, who was visibly distressed. Among those notably absent were top leaders including Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli and CPN (Unified Socialist) chief Madhav Nepal, as well as several Cabinet ministers and dozens of lawmakers from ruling and opposition benches. Out of 22, only eight ministers were present. A Nepali Congress leader said that Congress President Deuba was briefly present in the House, but had to leave due to health issues. But other senior Congress leaders and office bearers were notably absent. Similarly, CPN-UML chair Oli visited Parliament but did not enter the House. He left Parliament premises before the prime minister started speaking. Oli attended another function in the Capital.Several Cabinet ministers including two deputy prime ministers Raghubir Mahaseth and Narayan Kaji Shrestha were also absent when Dahal was responding to lawmakers’ queries. “There has been a tradition in Parliament that leaders of both opposition and ruling parties should be present when the prime minister speaks. The absence does not undermine the prime minister but rather the parliamentarians themselves. Except in emergencies, leaders of ruling and opposition parties, ministers and lawmakers traditionally attend the meeting where the prime minister speaks. But this tradition is being watered down, day by day. This definitely does not undermine the prime minister’s position,” said Dahal.The visibly upset prime minister said before concluding his statement by warning that “if such a trend continues, it is a gross insult to all of us.”Before making this statement, the prime minister answered questions from eleven lawmakers on various issues. He also discussed his recent visit to India and President Ramchandra Paudel’s visits to Switzerland and Germany.Prime Minister Dahal, earlier this month, attended the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. He also held talks with Indian President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Modi, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, among other top officials.During his meetings with Modi and Jaishanker, Dahal said, issues related to strengthening bilateral ties, activating bilateral mechanisms between Nepal and India, and increasing Indian investment in Nepal, among others, were discussed.While speaking in the House, the prime minister expressed his dissatisfaction with budgetary allocations stating the ministers did not follow his directives.“Ministers should take the prime minister’s directive seriously while selecting projects and programmes,” said Dahal. “Despite my directives, small and micro projects are still being included in the budget. You will be ministers and prime ministers tomorrow, so we need to correct these practices.”“Despite tall promises, this fiscal year’s budget has several small and micro level projects below Rs30 million. The government had earlier promised to entrust projects and programmes under Rs30 million to provincial governments. I am not fully satisfied with the budget and its provisions.”While responding to lawmakers’ queries, the prime minister said that those responsible for the Tikapur massacre would be punished. As many as eight people, including a toddler and seven policemen, were killed by protesters on August 24, 2015 in the run up to the promulgation of the constitution. Dahal also assured that the government is committed to ensuring the identity and social and economic empowerment of the Tharus and other socially and economically marginalised communities.The prime minister also informed Parliament that Nepal and India are seriously considering two dedicated religious corridors—the Ramayana and Buddha circuits—to promote religious tourism.“We have ensured the budget for developing Ramayana, Shiva, Buddha, and Kirat circuits,” said the prime minister. “Fifteen different religious sites between Nepal and India will be connected under the Ramayana and Buddha circuits.” Nepal and India have already reached agreements and understandings on developing these circuits.Similarly, the prime minister stated that the government is committed to making ambassadorial appointments more orderly, dignified, transparent, and performance-based. He also defended the government’s recent decision to recall Nepal’s ambassadors from several countries, stating that the decision was in line with the constitution.The recent decision to recall envoys from 11 nations created quite an uproar in various quarters.“The government is committed to using diplomatic missions and envoys in the best interest of the nation,” he said. “As per the Ambassador Appointment Directive, 2015, the envoys can be recalled before completing their terms, if necessary.”“Typically, only those appointed under political quota are recalled immediately after a change in coalition,” the prime minister said. “But this time, the envoys remained in their posts for more than three months after a change in the ruling coalition.”Dahal said this was proof of how the government was serious about the issue.Government picks some ambassadors under political quota based on recommendations from coalition partners while it selects some career diplomats from within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Talking about his recent India visit, Prime Minister Dahal also said that there were discussions on effective implementation of the agreements reached between the two South Asian neighbours.According to Dahal, among the issues discussed during a meeting with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, were strengthening Nepal-India relations, implementation of past agreements, and bilateral discussions—including border disputes. “There were serious discussions on the implementation of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, Arun Hydropower Project and cooperation in the agricultural sector,” Dahal said.Likewise, the prime minister stated that the government has initiated the formation of a high-level committee to address the challenges being faced by cooperatives.After the committee’s input and suggestions, crisis-ridden cooperatives will be identified and action initiated to return deposits and manage their assets.Dahal said that more than Rs772.44 million has already been refunded to the victims of cooperatives.Addressing the meeting, Dahal stated that 59,587 individuals, affected by cooperatives, had filed complaints alleging embezzlement of deposits totalling Rs36.28 billion. Of this, the government has so far paid back Rs 772.44 million.The prime minister added that the government had declared 20 different cooperatives as ‘crisis-ridden’ and that the process of refunding affected depositors was being facilitated through the Crisis-ridden Cooperative Management Committee.Dahal also mentioned that efforts are underway for a separate legal procedure to establish an independent regulatory body to protect cooperative savings.“The government is aware of the problems faced by cooperatives and is serious about addressing them. Various efforts have been made to implement the suggestions of the high-level task force and agreements reached with the cooperative victims under the coordination of the National Planning Commission last year,” he said.Prime Minister Dahal said that a committee had also been formed at the provincial and local levels to solve the problems of those affected by cooperatives.A law to establish an authority to regulate and supervise large-scale cooperatives is also being drafted, Dahal said. “Not all cooperatives are in trouble. Many have helped lift people’s livelihoods while operating based on established international practices and as per the law,” Dahal said.He added that despite the significant increase in the number of cooperatives, there were plenty of shortcomings in their qualitative improvement. \nWith the general convention of the CPN (Unified Socialist) approaching closer, top leaders of the party have intensified their preparations and lobbying for the top posts.As they expedite their lobbying through various informal channels, the party leaders in their formal speeches are emphasising the need of electing the leadership through a consensus.Senior leader Jhalanath Khanal did the same on Monday.A group of CPN-UML leaders led by Madhav Kumar Nepal, the party’s former chief, split the country’s largest communist party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) in August 2021. They split the party protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice.Following a poor performance in the 2022 elections, where it failed even to secure the status of the national party, the CPN (Unified Socialist) is now struggling to retain party members. Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders are finding it difficult even to stop its members from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.Amid the diminishing influence, the party is gearing up for the general convention scheduled for June 30 to July 4 in Kathmandu.If the claims recently made by the leaders are anything to go by, the two former prime ministers—Nepal and Khanal—will face each other for the position of party chief during the general convention. Both of the leaders also led the CPN-UML in the past.Khanal on Monday emphasised the need of electing the party leadership through a consensus.While addressing the event to launch ‘Mahila Sankalpa-2’, which is the mouthpiece of the party’s women’s wing, All Nepal Women’s Association, Khanal stressed the need for a consensual election of the leaders. However, a certain criteria of leadership should be followed, Khanal said.“To strengthen the leadership within the party, we must select the leaders of the party through a consensus,” Khanal said during the programme. “Since our party was formed on the basis of an ideological ground, political direction, and certain policies and principles, we all should strive to maintain these values while selecting the leadership as well.”A party insider claimed that Khanal staked his claim for the top position as his political line was adopted in the political document to be presented in the general convention. Party general secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal prepared the political document to be presented in the general convention of the party. While in the UML, party chair Nepal embraced Madan Bhandari’s People’s Multi-party Democracy unconditionally for many years while Khanal and Bhusal viewed it critically. According to party leaders, Khanal and Bhusal have succeeded in including their ideas in the Unified Socialist’s official line.“In politics, the leaders whose policies prevail as the party’s official line should get the opportunity to lead the party,” a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Though the political document of the party is guided by the thoughts of general secretary Bhusal, Khanal also owns it, so he is claiming the leadership.”This does not mean that party chair Nepal has not owned the political document passed by the party's central committee, but the document is closer to the political line advocated by Bhusal and Khanal for a long time, said a party insider.Party chair Nepal, while addressing the same programme on Monday, also said that there are no differences among the leaders in terms of the party’s ideological line. “The preparation of the political, organisational and other documents to be presented in the upcoming congress is a collective effort of party leaders and cadres,” Nepal said.In addition to Nepal and Khanal, the party's general secretary Bhusal is also considering contesting for the party chair in the upcoming congress, though he has not publicly announced it yet.“Matters related to the aspiration of the leaders for the post of office bearers will be clear only after the selection of convention representatives,” Jeevan Ram Shrestha, the secretary of the party, told the Post. “Before the selection of the representatives, all things that have come from the media are mere speculation.”The party has decided to select general convention representatives from around the country on Wednesday. Shrestha said that the selection of representatives will make things clearer about the aspirants’ claims.Khanal has already opened his contact office at Baneshwar with a plan to manage his team’s activities during the general convention.Though Khanal has opened his contact office, he may or may not contest for the vital post, says another leader of the party who does not want to disclose his identity. The leader said that it might be under his publicity strategy. “If the political scenario is not in his favour, Khanal might back Bhusal for the leadership of the party to challenge Nepal,” the leader claimed. “On the other hand, Nepal, the present chair of the party, might also back Bhusal if he senses a tough challenge from Khanal.”Bhusal has remained tightlipped about his candidacy in view of the situation, a leader close to Bhusal said. “If the two top leaders decide to face each other, Bhusal might settle with his current position of general secretary.”The party’s deputy general secretaries, Jagan Nath Khatiwada and Parkash Jwala, have already announced their bid for the post of general secretary.The party will most likely select the leadership through consensus, says another leader. Meanwhile, there are voices in favour of continuing present chair Nepal in the position saying that he has put utmost efforts to establish the party after the split and sustain it amid a challenging situation. But there are also leaders who want Khanal’s leadership.“One of the two leaders will possibly lead the party,” Unified Socialist leader Som Prasad Pandey, who is close to Nepal, told the Post. “Though Bhusal’s name is also in the discussion for the post of chair, he is most likely to continue as the general secretary.”Meanwhile, former CPN-UML vice-chair Bhim Rawal, who has remained inactive in the UML after the party's convention held in November 2021 in Chitwan, is reportedly considering joining the Unified Socialist from the upcoming congress. In 2021, Rawal challenged Oli for the position of party chair despite Oli’s request not to do so. Since then, Rawal has been given no role in the UML.“Our party is in talks with Bhim Rawal to bring him to the party. We have already held two rounds of negotiation with him,” Shrestha, the secretary, told the Post. “If everything goes as planned, Rawal will join our party with a respectable position.”The Post’s attempts to contact Rawal to confirm Shrestha’s claim were unsuccessful. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nDays after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Road—something the UML opposes.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said. \nDead bodies of a man and a woman were found on a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, located on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.According to the Kathmandu Valley Police Office, the bodies were spotted approximately 200 metres down the hill from the Kathmandu-Dakshinkali road.Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Raj Mainali said that the preliminary investigation suggests they died in an accident, as a crashed motorcycle was found near the bodies.Mainali said a disaster management team of Nepal Police is working to retrieve the bodies from the hill. He said locals informed the police after spotting the bodies on Wednesday evening.The police said the deceased woman is a 32-year-old resident of Changunarayan Municipality-5, while the man is yet to be identified. \nIn Nepal, the festivals measure the economy. Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to trim purchases.After a year, the situation seems unimproved.“We are not in the mood to place orders for goods for upcoming festivities,” said Ram Hari Karki, president of Nepal Trans Himalayan Border Commerce Association. “There is no demand at all. It looks like a deep economic slowdown.”Usually, traders place orders for foreign goods, particularly apparel, three months before the start of Nepal’s key festival season. Even though traders bring some amount of goods, it may be costlier. Due to the appreciation of the US dollar and increased customs duties, the prices of goods and commodities may rise, causing difficulties for many ordinary Nepalis.“Goods are becoming costlier day by day. That is why traders are cautious this year about placing orders,” said Karki. “The demand for festivities has not returned to the pre-pandemic level.”There are no statistics about consumption during the Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, but analysts say it grows manifold compared to the normal time. Kumar Karki, president of the Nepal National Traders’ Federation, said due to subdued demand, they may see a business decline by 15–20 percent. In comparison, prices may rise by 20 percent in the upcoming festivals.Even during the summer, traders say the market has slowed down.“Despite the rising heat, the demand for summer garments and shoes has not picked up,” said a trader in New Road, the country’s central shopping hub. “The footfall of shoppers has declined compared to last year’s season, reflecting the decline in people’s incomes.”“Nowadays, only a handful of traders are planning their trip to China to order goods. We don’t see demand recovering from last year’s drop,” said Kumar Karki.Some traders say there is a shift in the trade.In the past years, China fulfilled 80 percent of Nepal’s need for readymade garments.However, according to three top traders who spoke to the Post, the market seems flooded with Indian goods, which are relatively cheaper.Currently, traders said, an average of 15–20 loaded trucks are entering from Kerung and Tatopani customs points to the north, carrying garments, shoes and slippers, raincoats, and umbrellas, among other items. Before the Covid pandemic, 50–60 loaded trucks used to enter Nepal from the Chinese border at this time of the year.Cost is the key factor in subdued demand.On Friday, the Nepali rupee plunged to an all-time low of Rs134.15 against the dollar. A strong US dollar has advantages and disadvantages. It has negative impacts on an import-based economy like Nepal.“While importing goods, we must pay 30 to 40 percent as customs duty. The high customs duty has made imported goods expensive,” said Kumar Karki. The government needed to ease customs through the coming fiscal year's budget and further tighten it, he said. Importing goods through legal channels is becoming more difficult day by day, especially at the customs, and this has encouraged the illegal import of goods. This has resulted in an import decline.According to the central bank's macroeconomic report, the inflation rate on non-food and services remained at 2.96 percent in mid-May this year, compared to 8.89 percent a year ago. The year-on-year price index of clothes and footwear remained at 3.46 percent.Market analysts, however, say that data presents different facts than the actual market scenario. Economists say that youth are the significant spenders, and demand has declined in sectors like education and restaurants, including consumption of goods and services, as many youths have migrated abroad to study and work.Economist Nara Bahadur Thapa said that import-related activities used to increase by 30 percent with the start of a new fiscal year compared to other months before Covid. However, the number of traders importing goods by opening Letters of Credit (LC) has declined in recent years.“From July to October, imports used to spike and cross Rs200 billion per month, but now, even with the rise in foreign exchange rate, it hardly crosses Rs150 billion. This shows that the demand has declined as a result of economic slowdown,” Thapa said.Thapa said that as people's purchasing power has declined, the demand for different goods in major festival times has declined. The salaries of government and private sector employees have not increased in the past few years. “People are not going to spend unless they have money in their hands.”According to the Department of Customs, Nepal’s imports declined by 1.84 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended in mid-June, compared to the same period last fiscal year.The country’s imports slipped 16.08 percent to Rs1.61 trillion in the last fiscal year. \n\nThe Nepali rupee recorded an all-time low, with Nepal’s central bank fixing the exchange rate at Rs134.15 per US dollar for Friday.The Nepali currency was weakened by 31 paisa against the dollar in a single day. The rupee’s fall is attributed to a steady depreciation of the Indian rupee, to which it is pegged.Experts say Nepal, an import-driven economy, may see a sharp rise in inflation due to the dollar's strength, as almost all goods and services are quoted in dollar terms.Commodities like edible oil, petroleum fuel, and foods are priced in dollars globally, so a stronger dollar adds to the cost of Nepali consumers. As food expenditures make up large shares of consumption, the constant weakening of the local currency makes the goods dearer in Nepal.Traders say apparel prices may rise in the upcoming festival season as they have started to place orders. Kumar Karki, president of the Nepal National Traders’ Federation, said the rising dollar may make goods, particularly apparel and electronics, more expensive during the Dashain and Tihar festivals. According to estimates, sales of food and non-food items surge manifold during the festival period.Traders have already started visiting China to place orders, especially for goods to be imported for festival sales in October, said Karki. Most festival goods, such as readymade clothes, shoes, bags, and accessories, are imported from China.According to media reports, the dollar strengthened as the Swiss National Bank delivered an interest-rate cut, underscoring the divergence in monetary policies among global central banks as the US Federal Reserve delayed easing policy. In India, the central bank has allowed the rupee to weaken, though it intervenes to curb wild swings. Nepali currency automatically strengthens when the Indian currency is strong and weakens when the Indian currency weakens. Nepal has been following a pegged exchange rate system with the Indian rupee.Nepal adopts a different kind of exchange rate system for other convertible currencies.In line with the economic liberalisation policy introduced in the mid-1980s, Nepal introduced current account convertibility in 1993, effectively pegging the Nepali rupee to the Indian rupee at the rate of 1.60, the same rate as in 1960 when the two currencies were first pegged. Since 1993, the exchange rate of the Nepali rupee with other convertible currencies has been market-determined in line with the exchange rate of the Indian rupee with convertible currencies.A strong US dollar has both advantages and disadvantages for a country like Nepal. It benefits some but negatively impacts others.According to Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of Nepal Rastra Bank, the depreciation of the domestic currency could exert pressure on the balance of payments as Nepal would have to spend more money to buy foreign goods.According to him, the depreciation of the domestic currency is likely to worsen inflation, as the country is highly dependent on imported goods and has low domestic output.“The currency’s devaluation makes exports cheaper, measured in foreign currency, and imports become more expensive, measured in the home currency.”The price effect may lead the goods and services sector of Nepal to weaken, said Karki. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, in the first ten months of the current fiscal year, merchandise exports decreased by 3.6 percent to Rs126.17 billion.However, merchandise imports amounted to a staggering Rs1.30 trillion in the review period.The most significant impact will be on purchasing petroleum products, Nepal’s biggest import, on which the country is fully dependent. It will also impact the cost of chemical fertiliser.On the other hand, the appreciation of the US dollar can benefit remittance earners. Remittance inflows increased 19.2 percent to Rs1.19 trillion in the review period. Another advantage will be on the foreign exchange reserve, according to experts.Those countries with ample reserves may sell foreign exchange to bolster their currencies. Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased to a record $14.54 billion in mid-May.Similarly, a soaring US dollar means tourists can buy more of the Nepali currency. Visitors from abroad will find the prices of goods and services in Nepal cheaper with a stronger dollar.Travel income, the money spent by foreigners, increased 35 percent to Rs69.41 billion in the first ten months of the current fiscal year.The strong dollar increases the burden of debt repayment in local currency terms.Thus, as the dollar becomes stronger relative to other currencies, these repayments become more expensive in terms of the domestic currency.The price of gold also increases in the local market when the dollar rises.The Nepali currency vis-à-vis the US dollar depreciated 1.61 percent in mid-May 2024 from mid-July 2023, while it had depreciated 2.79 percent in the same period of the previous year. \nThanks to a favourable climate, farmer Bhagwati Kandel rejoices at this season’s bumper potato harvest. His profits have also grown, with the vegetable fetching better prices this year.Potatoes are a superfood rich in essential vitamins and minerals and high in calories. As green vegetables have become prohibitively expensive for some, potatoes fill the vacuum and grow in demand. Potato farmers in Rainas Municipality generally sell their produce at nearby markets. This year, however, the situation is quite different. Vegetable traders are arriving at the farmers' doors to buy potatoes, a versatile food.Kandel of Rainas Municipality Ward 4 produced 16 tonnes of potatoes on her 10 ropanies.She sold 8 tonnes at Rs23 per kg from the field. The government also provided Rs2 per kg to potato farmers as an incentive to grow the vegetable.Kandel was encouraged to cultivate potatoes after the Agriculture Knowledge Centre provided seeds at a 75 percent subsidy and trained farmers on responsive pest management technology.The result was a bumper harvest. She earned Rs200,000, including the government subsidy.Shiva Adhikari of Sundarbazaar Municipality Ward 10 produced 4 tonnes of potatoes. He sold 3 tonnes and earned around Rs86,000.This season, Adhikari and 40 other farmers associated with the Bhagyodaya Farmers Group produced 50 tonnes of potatoes. Nearly half the output sold from their fields for a total of Rs555,450. The remaining potatoes were sold for the market price, ranging from Rs30 to Rs40 per kg. Kandel said that the farmers got better prices by selling the potatoes in retail.In the hills and mountains, planting starts in November, and harvesting is done usually in June. The potatoes cultivated in upper areas from January to February are harvested in June.Sudip Khatiwada, senior plant development officer at the Agriculture Knowledge Center, said that farmers in three municipalities—Rainas, Sundarbazaar, and Madhyanepal—produced 474 tonnes of potatoes on 509 ropanies this year. They sold 247 tonnes and earned Rs5.72 million. Potatoes continue to be crucial to global food security as a key diet to fight hunger and poverty.Khatiwada said that the local government is encouraging farmers to produce more potatoes due to their market value and growing demand.“Farmers sell their crops to wholesalers. They get even more value if they sell to retailers.”In retail, potatoes fetch up to Rs40 per kg. “In Lamjung, farmers in eight different groups earned more than Rs10 million this season,” Khatiwada said. According to the centre, 59 farmers of Rainash Municipality-4 produced 152 tonnes of potatoes. Of these, 88 tonnes were sold from the farm for Rs2.38 million. The farmers also received Rs177,300 in subsidies from the Agriculture Knowledge Centre.According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development statistics, potato is grown in Nepal on 198,256 hectares, with an annual yield of 3.41 million tonnes. In Lamjung, potato is produced on 1,975 hectares with an annual output of 38,500 tonnes.Ishwor Gurung, another potato farmer, said that in Lamjung, farmers in the lower altitudes usually grow winter potatoes. Potatoes are grown in the rainy season in the upper reaches, where temperatures are low. “We have harvested potatoes and are selling them currently,” Gurung said. Potatoes are one of the world's most important food crops. Experts say potato production must be adapted to climate change to avoid reductions in crop yield. Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are predicted to benefit potato plants and crop yields. The major benefit of this phenomenon for potatoes is an increase in their photosynthetic rates, which can increase their growth rates.In Lamjung, according to Khatiwada, the production is sometimes different.“The production cost is high. Most of the time, farmers have to bear losses if the output declines due to pests,” said Khatiwada. “We have assisted farmers by providing seed and technical know-how.” “We are also making arrangements for farmers to sign advance contracts with buyers,” he said. Under this initiative, buyers make a purchase agreement with farmers before potato planting.Khatiwada said this ensures farmers the market for their crop. \nA 45-year-old woman from Dhapasi, Kathmandu was diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes some six months ago. Doctors at the National Cardiac Center, who attended to the patient prescribed medicines and advised her to change her lifestyle and eating habits to control the ailments.“The patient, who was worried about her health conditions, took the doctors’ advice seriously and joined a yoga class in the morning, made a drastic change in her eating habits, and engaged in physical activities,” said Dr Om Murti Anil, a senior cardiologist. “Her blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels are now under control, and she has also reduced her weight. Now, she doesn't need the high dose of medicines like in the past. ”This was a common refrain among a few patients, who took doctors' advice seriously, changed their lifestyles and eating habits, joined yoga classes, and increased physical activity, which helped them control high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.Public health experts say changing eating habits, lessening body weight, and starting physical activities, including yoga and physical exercises, help control non-communicable diseases, which have emerged as a major public health problem in Nepal.Studies show that non-communicable diseases have emerged as a serious public health issue in Nepal, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that they accounted for 71 percent of the deaths in the country. The study primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption—and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.“For many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,” said Anil. “To reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.”Many patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity. Doctors warn that non-communicable diseases—hypertension, heart disease, stroke and diabetes, among others—could lead to a public health crisis if not addressed immediately. They blame a sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of processed foods as chief culprits for the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and obesity.They warn that people from all walks of life have been affected by the repercussions of changing lifestyles and food habits. Entire family members suffer if any member, particularly the breadwinner, faces serious health problems.Experts say continuous awareness campaigns about the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, and the start of yoga classes in community centres, schools, and open-air gyms could help lessen the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. “Physical exercises not only help in managing the disease conditions but also lessen the risk of developing non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Munkarna Thapa, information officer at the Department of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. “Along with physical fitness, they contribute to the mental well-being of people.”Meanwhile, department officials said that they have allocated a budget to promote open-air fitness centres, yoga classes, and alternatives, keeping in mind the growing burden of non-communicable diseases in society.Open-air gyms have been set up in public places, and the public can use them free of charge. Apart from setting up outdoor gyms, imparting training to communities and school students and promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce the major risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases, Thapa said.The department, which has already set up open-air fitness centres at the headquarters of all seven provinces, plans to set up 10 more such centres in the upcoming fiscal year. Several local units also have set up such facilities in their areas. \nIn a bid to address the problem of malnutrition in children under five, the Ministry of Health and Population has started imparting training to nurses and paramedics serving in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Officials hope that a week-long training programme will help lessen the existing problems of malnutrition in those provinces.“Imparting training to combat malnutrition in small children is our nationwide programme, which we have started from Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Along with imparting training to health workers, we will also launch an awareness drive to improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.”Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.The report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, but progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.The report shows that exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining, from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent last year. Health officials said that studies show that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies.According to the report, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing mothers’ education, from 12 percent among those whose mothers have no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile at 46 percent and lowest in the lowest quintile at 11 percent.Likewise, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province at 11 percent, in Madhesh Province at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province at 43 percent.Exclusive breastfeeding is the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and the lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.“We have allocated the nutrition budget to launch a nationwide awareness drive about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the upcoming fiscal year,” said Thapa. “We have also designated a nutrition focal person at every local unit who is tasked to discourage practices of promoting replacement feeding.”The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared with 12 percent of those born at home. Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children, according to the World Health Organisation.Health ministry officials hoped that training for nurses and paramedics would help lessen bottle-feeding practices in health facilities.Doctors say breastfeeding should continue for the first two years or beyond, as breast milk lowers children’s risk of illness, promotes their recovery during illness, and remains an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nDiarrhoeal cases have declined threefold in Nepal, multiple reports, including a recent one by the Nepal Statistics Office, show. The Nepal Demographic Health Survey-2022 and a report of the Ministry of Health and Population suggest the same.Improvements in water and sanitation conditions, personal hygiene and awareness levels are credited with the decline in infection from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoeal infections.“A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices,” reads a report by the Nepal Statistics Office.Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health concern usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. It is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young children.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, also showed that 10 percent of children under 5 have diarrhoea. The prevalence of diarrhoea is highest among children aged 6-11 months at 18 percent, followed by 13 percent each among those aged 12–23 months and less than six months.Public health experts say the decline in open defecation, the general public’s behavioural change towards hygienic practice, and an increase in literacy and education levels could have also contributed to a decline in diarrhoeal infections.“Decline in open defecation, rise in education and awareness levels, behavioural changes, improvement in water and sanitation conditions play an important role in cutting the burden of diarrhoeal infections,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “We can see a lot of changes in these things, but at the same time, we should not forget that sources of drinking water are still problematic in many places, including in the capital city.”According to the NDHS report, advice or treatment was sought for 57 percent of children who had diarrhoea in the two weeks preceding the survey, down from 64 percent in 2016.The report also shows that the percentage of diarrhoeal infection is lower among those with an unimproved source of drinking water at 4 percent than among those with an improved source at 11 percent.Experts say that so-called improved sources of drinking water are still not safe to drink.“E.coli and coliform-like hazardous microbes get detected in most water resources, including in the samples of bottled water,” Pun said. “We must be more cautious while drinking water, as the monsoon season has just started and most water sources get contaminated with floodwaters.”Earlier in March, drinking water samples collected from public taps and community schools in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur were found to be contaminated with faecal coliform.Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. Its presence means that the drinking water being used by locals of Godawari is contaminated with sewage.The Ministry of Health and Population’s annual report for the fiscal year 2022-23 also shows a three-fold decline in diarrhoeal infections. According to the report, the national incidence rate of diarrhoea was 115 per 1,000 under-five children in 2022-23 compared to 365 in the fiscal year 2021-22.The ministry’s report showed four under-five deaths from diarrhoeal infection in the fiscal year 2022-23 compared to 34 deaths in 2021-22.Of the four deaths that occurred in the fiscal year 2022-23, one each was recorded in Bagmati, Madhesh, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with no reported diarrhoeal death in Lumbini, Koshi, and Gandaki provinces.Contrary to the NDHS, the health ministry’s report shows that Karnali Province had the highest incidence of diarrhoea—216, followed by Lumbini Province’s 161. The lowest incidence was reported in Bagmati Province at 78.According to the World Health Organisation, diarrhoea is the second leading cause of mortality in children under five. The disease has also been linked with growth and cognitive shortfalls in children, especially in marginalised communities.Doctors say the only ways to prevent people from dying of water-borne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nRussian guided bombs shattered an apartment building in Ukraine’s second-largest city on Saturday, killing three people, injuring 52 and prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to call for more help to deal with the growing threat of such weapons.Pictures posted online showed parts of the five-storey apartment building in ruins, with windows smashed, balconies wrecked and rubble strewn about a crater on the ground.Prosecutors in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region put the casualty toll at three dead and 52 injured in the mid-afternoon attack, including three injured children. Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said four of those hurt were in serious condition.“This Russian terror through guided bombs must be stopped and can be stopped,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.“We need strong decisions from our partners to enable us to stop the Russian terrorists and Russian military aviation right where they are.”Later, in his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said Russian forces had used more than 2,400 guided bombs on Ukrainian targets in June alone, with about 700 aimed at Kharkiv.He said after US Congress gave delayed approval of a big aid package in April, Ukraine's replenished arms supplies had reduced the devastation and frequency of missile attacks and the same had to be done now to fend off these bombs.“The significant reduction in Russian missile terror against Kharkiv and the region proves it is entirely possible to secure our cities and communities from Russian bombs,” he said.Ukraine, he said, needed promised military aid packages “without delay so that the agreements we reached with (US) President Biden can be realised.”Ukraine and the US signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement this month aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defense against Russia and getting Ukraine closer to NATO membership.Russia has relied increasingly on relatively inexpensive guided bombs, dropped from a distance and involving fewer risks for its forces.Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has advanced slowly through Donetsk region in the east, capturing a string of villages since seizing the key industrial town of Avdiivka more than three months ago.It launched a cross-border incursion north of Kharkiv last month, though Zelenskiy says the situation there has stabilised.In the latest bomb attack, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said there had been four strikes on Kharkiv.Regional governor Syniehubov said rescue work was proceeding at the building, which housed a store on the ground floor.Kharkiv Police Chief Serhiy Bolvinov told public broadcaster Suspilne that three floors had collapsed, but he believed no one was trapped under the rubble.Kharkiv lies about 30 km (20 miles) from the border with Russia. The city of 1.3 million people has frequently been targeted in Russian attacks during nearly 28 months of war.Moscow denies deliberately targeting civilians but thousands have been killed and injured in the war. \nA shooter opened fire at an Arkansas supermarket on Friday, killing three civilians and wounding 10 other people, including two police officers, Arkansas State Police said.The suspect was also wounded in a shootout with police, Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters.The shooting occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery in Fordyce, a town of 3,200 people about 70 miles (112 km) south of Little Rock.“Unfortunately, we can confirm that 11 innocent civilians were shot, and three of those are deceased. Two law enforcement officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire. The suspect was also shot and taken into custody,” Hagar said. He did not explain the circumstances of the shooting or take questions.The wounded police officers and the suspect were expected to survive, he said.Civilian injuries ranged from non-life-threatening to extremely critical, he said.Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on social media platform X that she was briefed on the incident.“I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident,” she said. \nSummaryIsraeli strikes kill at least 45 Palestinians in GazaForces pound southern city of RafahIsrael says forces carrying out ‘precise, intelligence-based’ actionsIsraeli military finds militants’ tunnels in Rafah, it saysIsraeli forces pounded Rafah in southern Gaza on Friday, as well as other areas across the enclave, killing at least 45 Palestinians as troops engaged in close-quarter combat with Hamas militants, residents and Israel’s military said.Residents said the Israelis appeared to be trying to complete their capture of Rafah, which borders Egypt and has been the focus of an Israeli assault since early May.Tanks were forcing their way into the western and northern parts of the city, having already captured the east, south and centre.Firing from planes, tanks and ships off the coast caused more people to flee the city, which a few months ago was sheltering more than a million displaced people, most of whom have now relocated again.The Gaza health ministry said at least 25 Palestinians had been killed in Mawasi in western Rafah and 50 wounded. Palestinians said a tank shell hit a tent housing displaced families.“Two tanks climbed a hilltop overseeing Mawasi and they sent balls of fire that hit the tents of the poor people displaced in the area,” one resident told Reuters over a chat app.The Israeli military said that the incident was under review. “An initial inquiry conducted suggests that there is no indication that a strike was carried out by the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi,” it said.Earlier, the military said its forces were conducting “precise, intelligence-based” actions in the Rafah area, where troops were involved in close-quarter combat and had located tunnels used by militants.Over the past week, the military said, troops targeted a university that served as a Hamas headquarters from which militants fired on soldiers and found weapons and barrel bombs. It did not name the university.In the central Gaza area of Nusseirat, the military said soldiers killed dozens of militants over the past week and found a weapons depot containing mortar bombs and military equipment belonging to Hamas.Some residents said the Israeli onslaught on Rafah had intensified in the previous two days and that the sounds of explosions and gunfire had hardly stopped.“Last night was one of the worst nights in western Rafah: Drones, planes, tanks, and naval boats bombarded the area. We feel the occupation is trying to complete the control of the city,” said Hatem, 45, reached by text message.“They are taking heavy strikes from the resistance fighters, which may be slowing them down.”STRIKES ON KHAN YOUNIS AND GAZA CITYMore than eight months into the war in Gaza, Israel’s advance is now focused on the two last areas its forces had yet to seize: Rafah on Gaza’s southern edge and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre.“The entire city of Rafah is an area of Israeli military operations,” Ahmed Al-Sofi, the mayor of Rafah, said in a statement carried by Hamas media on Friday.“The city is living through a humanitarian catastrophe and people are dying inside their tents because of Israeli bombardment.”Sofi said no medical facility was functioning in the city, and that remaining residents and displaced families lacked the minimum daily needs of food and water.Palestinian and UN figures show that fewer than 100,000 people may have remained in the far western side of the city, which had been sheltering more than half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people before the Israeli assault began in early May.In nearby Khan Younis, an Israeli air strike on Friday killed three people, including a father and son, medics said.In parallel, Israeli forces continued a new push back into some Gaza City suburbs in the north of the enclave, where they fought with Hamas-led militants.On Friday, an Israeli air strike on a Gaza City municipal facility killed five people, including four municipal workers, the territory’s Civil Emergency Service said. Rescue teams were searching the rubble for more missing victims.In the nearby Beach camp, an Israeli air strike on a house killed at least seven people, medics said.Palestinian health officials said at least 45 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Friday.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its Gaza office was damaged when heavy-calibre projectiles landed nearby, in an area where hundreds of displaced Palestinians are living in tents.“This grave security incident is one of several in recent days; previously stray bullets have reached ICRC structures,” the organization said in a post on X on Friday.“We decry these incidents that put the lives of humanitarians and civilians at risk.”Israel’s ground and air campaign was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute.The United Nations said on Friday it is Israel’s responsibility - as the occupying power in the Gaza Strip - to restore public order and safety in the Palestinian territory so humanitarian aid can be delivered, amid warnings of imminent famine. \nThe death toll from days of torrential rain in one of the worst-hit areas in southern China jumped to 38 from nine on Friday, Chinese state television CCTV reported.Downpours this week in Meizhou city in Guangdong province led to flash floods and mudslides that destroyed thousands of low-rise houses, damaged roads and crops, and disrupted communications and power supplies.Two people remain missing in Meizhou’s Pingyuan county, CCTV said.Southern China has been battered by an unusual amount of rains in recent days following an earlier-than-normal start to the annual flooding season.Accumulated precipitation in Pingyuan has reached 1,221.6 millimetres (4 ft) since April 4, more than double the normal amount in the same period of previous years, CCTV said.Deaths during China’s annual summer floods have fallen sharply from the thousands each year in the 1990s, as authorities beefed up flood control measures such as dams.Yet extreme weather in recent years, including record-breaking rainfall, has made China vulnerable to intense flooding and disasters such as sudden mudslides, often in its mountainous but populated areas.The task of controlling floods in China is becoming increasingly arduous, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, calling for all-out efforts to safeguard lives and property as powerful storms pounded China’s southern provinces.China’s National meteorological Center said on Friday a typhoon could form over the weekend and affect coastal areas in the country’s south.Natural disasters, including floods, droughts, an earthquake and freezing weather in China caused direct economic losses of 23.76 billion yuan ($3.27 billion) in the first quarter. \nThe death toll from the latest case of tainted liquor in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu has climbed to 47, with over 100 people still in hospital, a government official said on Friday.Since Wednesday more than 150 people, suffering from vomiting, stomach aches and diarrhoea, have needed treatment after drinking methanol-mixed liquor made in the Kallakurichi district, about 250 km (150 miles) from the state capital Chennai.On Friday morning, 118 people were still being treated in hospitals in the district and nearby areas, the government official said.On Thursday, a government spokesperson said at least 36 people had died.Police arrested four people over illicit liquor sales and seized 200 litres of the alcoholic drink, the state government said on Thursday, adding that it had taken disciplinary action against 10 officials for failure to prevent it.Deaths from illegally produced alcohol, known locally as “hooch” or “country liquor”, are a regular occurrence in India, where many cannot afford branded spirits, even as the public and activists call for a crackdown on the sellers.The Tamil Nadu government said it was taking steps to identify people involved in the production of methanol - a toxic chemical normally used for industrial purposes.Videos from ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake, and local media showed state ministers and opposition leaders making a beeline to the district to meet the victims.There was mass cremation of the deceased and families carried out last rites only a few metres (yards) apart, videos showed, reminiscent of images from India during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.More than a dozen people died last year in a similar incident in a nearby district of Tamil Nadu. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK, a hospital patient who spent over Rs50,000 on medical bills, highlights the widespread disregard for Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 by private hospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal, denying free treatment to the underprivileged despite government mandates\nDespite winning a third term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party lost its parliamentary majority, raising concerns about his future governance and the ongoing prosecution of dissenting voices, including prominent writer Arundhati Roy, under anti-terrorism legislation.\nIn yet another instance of the Nepali society failing to provide a safe space to women, a 16-year girl was raped in Panchadewal Binayak Municipality in Achham on Monday. The victim was staying in a chhau goth, or menstrual shed, at her maternal uncle’s home when she was violated by her distant relative. After years of awareness campaigns and the breaking of chhau sheds by central and local governments as well as non-governmental agencies, the victimisation of women remains a daily occurrence in several parts of Nepal, especially Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. The chhaupadi system was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2005; in 2017, it was made punishable by up to three months in jail or a fine of Rs3,000 or both. But the inhumane practice remains deeply rooted in parts of Nepali society. While reports of extreme cases come from the hinterlands, menstrual taboo rules the roost even in the sophisticated drawing rooms and kitchens of urban centres. Impurity runs in the psyche of the average Nepali; menstrual blood simply oils the juggernaut of superstition, patriarchy and misogyny that is Nepali society.As disturbing as the news of the rape is the report that the victim’s relatives tried to conceal the incident. After all, this is a society whose so-called honour lies in the private parts of a woman. If it cannot save the woman from predators, it must hide the fact that it could not save the woman. From celebrating and defending rape-accused celebrities to punishing victims for speaking up, this society fails women each day. Just consider how unsafe this place is for women who have to suffer the indignity of chhau in this day and age. Cold, rain, wild animals, serpents or asphyxiation do not even come close to the danger they face from men. The tragic irony is that the woman who becomes “impure” or “untouchable” inside the home remains an object of desire inside the chhau shed. Consider how many cases of sexual assaults might have been brushed under the carpet in the name of family honour. Every night a woman has to spend in a chhau shed should count as the death of the conscience of Nepali society.Gauri Kumari Bayak and Amba Bohara and her two children were killed in 2018; Parbati Bogati and Parbati Budha were killed in 2019 in menstrual huts; and the list goes on, the tragedies returning each year. How many women must be raped and murdered before the society goes beyond the “shame” and “honour” dichotomy and considers women equal humans? How many seminars, constitutions and movements does it take for the state to be able to create a safe space for women? The society and the state must answer. Until it can guarantee safety and dignity to the women, the Nepali state might want to keep the national flag half-mast. After all, one-half of the flag belongs to the women, who make up half of the country's population.  \nNepal's bittersweet T20 World Cup performance showcased their cricketing prowess despite no wins, highlighted by a near-miss against South Africa, while also revealing areas for improvement and the need for infrastructure investment.\nAmidst global efforts towards an electric future, Nepal faces challenges in setting EV policies, with a recent tax hike hindering its commitment to EV-based mobility and discouraging the use of EVs despite their potential benefits in reducing emissions, fostering clean air, and promoting hydropower utilization.\nRegistration of corruption cases against elected representatives and officials at local units across the country has become common. The situation is so bad that several local units have even been unable to do their regular work as officials who make key decisions have been suspended after facing corruption charges. For instance, works at Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur, Bagmati Municipality of Sarlahi and Jaleswar Municipality of Mahottari have been hampered as both mayors and deputy mayors of the municipalities have been suspended after they were chargesheeted in corruption cases. The local units have been paralyzed as they haven’t been able to settle who will make decisions as the acting chief; existing laws didn’t envision both top officials being sued at the same time. The Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration is now consulting the Office of the Attorney General on removing legal complications in this regard.Not only elected representatives, key bureaucrats are as engaged in irregularities. Corruption cases have been filed against chief administrative officers of scores of municipalities in the past one year. Some of them have been convicted while cases against many others are sub-judice. Annual reports of the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) paint an alarming picture of irregularities in local administrations. For instance, according to the annual report-2022/23 of the CIAA, of the total 28,067 cases filed by the anti-graft body in the one-year period, 13,142 cases were against officials of local units. Likewise, 11,632 cases were against the officials at the federal agencies and 3,293 against provincial officials. Hence, over 46.8 percent of total corruption cases the CIAA registered in the period are against the irregularities committed by local representatives and officials.The new constitution greatly empowered the local units through the devolution of many erstwhile centralised powers. The constitution is considered to be favouring local authorities even more than the provinces when it comes to rights and responsibilities. After the full-fledged implementation of the three-tier federal system since 2017, all the 753 local units have been exercising executive, legislative and judicial rights in running local administration and formulating rules for themselves. The constitution empowered them significantly but not much was done to enhance their capacity for delivery. Nearly eight years of federal experience shows the local units have failed to maintain good governance and fiscal transparency. Local representatives blame lack of efficient employees and dearth of resources for their substandard performance. Traditionally, civil servants in Nepal have always preferred to stay in urban centres. Also, the federal government has failed to provide sufficient manpower, efficient technical hands and enough resources to improve efficiency in administration outside the Valley. The nature and magnitude of corruption cases and irregularities seen in recent years suggest urgent steps are needed to make the local governments more accountable, transparent and efficient. What we see right now is the representatives and the provincial and local levels repeating many of the corrupt practices of the federal-level representatives. It is hard to make the local representatives responsible when they see that their party bosses at the centre are even more unaccountable and unreliable.  \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nLawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nAmnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nCIAA charges sitting Chief Secretary Baikuntha Aryal and 11 others in a Rs386.7 million corruption case related to excise duty sticker printing irregularities, suspending Aryal from his position.\nA king cobra bite in Sindhupalchowk highlights the migration of venomous snakes to hill and mountain districts due to rising temperatures caused by climate change, prompting concerns over increased snakebite cases and the need for expanded treatment centers and awareness campaigns.\nDespite severe period pain, 19-year-old Ekta's concerns were dismissed as normal, leading to delayed diagnosis of endometriosis, a debilitating condition often ignored due to the normalization of period pain.\nMonsoon rains have caused floods and landslides in Jajarkot, Panchthar, Lamjung, and Sankhuwasabha, claiming several lives, displacing families, and disrupting transportation.\nAmidst government controversy over ambassadorial recalls, Nepal's PM Dahal's Delhi visit aimed to enhance bilateral ties, expedite trade agreements with India and China, and promote BRI projects, facing challenges in implementation but highlighting the importance of economic diplomacy and regional energy trade.\nThe National Budget endorsement in the House of Representatives was obstructed by protesting Parliament staff demanding overtime allowances, leading to the formation of a government committee to resolve the issue.\nThe issue of jurisdiction that has cropped up in the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives across the country is nothing but a distraction to take the attention away from the main agenda. According to Sishir Khanal, a committee member from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), it is unclear whether a committee formed by the federal Parliament can investigate the cooperatives that come under the jurisdiction of the provincial and local level governments. Khanal and the RSP are clearly fishing for a legal loophole to absolve the party chair and current deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane of the crime of routing money from various cooperatives into the Gorkha Media Network. There is documentary proof of money from at least four cooperatives being pumped into the network at a time Lamichhane was its managing director. Some of these cooperatives fall under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. Khanal said the committee should work in a way that no legal questions can later be raised over its final recommendations. This is a flawed argument. A bit of context is warranted.The committee was formed after the main opposition, Nepali Congress, disrupted parliamentary proceedings for nearly two months, demanding that Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperative scam, particularly in relation to the Gorkha Media Network, be probed. After long negotiations, it was agreed that a parliamentary committee would indeed be formed and while the committee’s ToR would not mention Lamichhane, it would name the network. The fourth point of the committee’s ToR mentions that it will “study the status of the funds transferred to various organisations, including Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd, whether the funds were obtained legally or illegally, and how the funds were put to use will be conducted.” Legal experts the Post talked to were of the view that though many cooperatives may be operating under local or provincial laws, the federal government can regulate them, and as such the probe committee should have no problem in this regard. They point to the country’s constitution which gives the federal government the mandate to regulate all cooperatives.Here, we must again remember that the committee’s ToR mentions that all those entities from which funds have been transferred to the Gorkha Media Network will be probed. No distinction is made between the cooperatives that fall under the jurisdictions of various levels of government. Moreover, the committee had to be formed in order to meet the opposition’s central demand that the involvement of a sitting deputy prime minister and home minister in such an egregious crime be investigated. This is also why the name of the now-defunct media company he was once involved with is mentioned. As the seven-member probe committee has only three months, they should be working full time in determining those responsible for misappropriating hundreds of billions of rupees of common people. As a part of this process, the committee’s task will also be incomplete if it cannot either clear or implicate Lamichhane over the transfer of various cooperatives’ money into the accounts of a private media company. \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \nOverhead bridges often become hangout spaces where people spend time observing the hustle and bustle of the city. Even in the small and noisy traffic island of Koteshwor junction, one can observe people resting and killing time. Similarly, plenty of people visit the open land of Koteshwor-Tinkune to play sports, and many more are there as spectators.These examples indicate the growing demand and potential for public spaces in Kathmandu.Having public spaces in urban areas has multiple benefits. Open spaces improve public health by providing space for physical activity and refreshment. They make places socially and economically vibrant by attracting people and activities. They serve as emergency shelters during disasters like earthquakes. If planned well, open spaces help in biodiversity conservation and groundwater recharge. However, the situation of open spaces in Kathmandu Valley is miserable. UN-Habitat recommends 15-20 percent of urban land for open public spaces. However, according to a report published by the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority, only 2.29 percent of the land was available as open space in 2012, and the condition has not improved. The irregular distribution of public spaces has also reinforced their unavailability. Advocates for urban public spaces recommend the availability of open spaces within walking distance, a 400-metre radius. However, many places in our cities do not have public spaces nearby, and even when they are available, they are usually gated and inaccessible.Public parks are confined within high boundary walls and gates. Shielding public spaces from the public is a paradox, although it is supported by common reasonings such as possible vandalism, waste littering and maintenance difficulty. As a result, we are undermining the value of public spaces.Similarly, unifunctional and exclusive planning approaches have also compromised the effectiveness of public spaces. Public parks designed for specific demographics, such as elderly people’s and children’s parks, have become a new trend. When this is not the case, the spaces still lack provisions for a diverse population: Women, children, differently abled and so on.Furthermore, ecological dimensions are rarely considered during the development of public spaces. Local hydrology, geology, biodiversity, and natural ecosystems are disregarded. Approaches like the plantation of non-native vegetation for mere beautification, a large proportion of hardscape, and the absence of stormwater management systems show a superficial approach to public space management.In addition to these issues, open spaces constantly threaten encroachment. Sometimes, encroachments seem like an act of conservation but end up with the controlled ownership of some individuals or groups. The Nepal Army’s occupation of part of Tundikhel is one such example. At other times, public spaces are intruded by building construction and infrastructural development. Despite all such challenges, urban public spaces can be enhanced in many ways.First and foremost, existing and potential open spaces should be identified; larger parks, khya (culturally significant open lands), urban pockets, riverfronts, traditional ponds, courtyards and other potential spaces should be mapped out and planned for. Encroached public lands should be reclaimed. As for new urban areas, the government should provide open spaces beforehand.After that, identified public spaces should be managed, with due consideration of their typology and context. Larger parks can be developed with a significant proportion of native greenery and diverse spaces such as sports areas, recreational areas, water bodies, and gardens. Basic services like public toilets and drinking water services should be arranged.Smaller spaces can be designed as urban green pockets. Machhindra Park near Jawalakhel is one good example. Cultural-communal lands such as Khya should be managed with minimal interventions.Riverside landscape can also be capitalised as urban public spaces. Some riverside parks, such as Sankhamul Park, have already demonstrated the use value of riverfronts. However, the custom of retaining wall boundaries and ornamental landscape disassociates the river’s relationship with the land and people. Therefore, riverside development that promotes biodiversity and ecological sustainability and strengthens people’s physical and spiritual relationship with water is essential.Next, we can capitalise on traditional open spaces like ponds and courtyards. For instance, ponds can be revitalised with proper pavements, seating spaces, and safety. Pim Bahal Pukhu at Patan and Nigu Pukhu at Thimi are perfect examples of traditional pond-based revitalisation that boosted the place’s socio-economic activities.Furthermore, creative strategies are required to transform unconventional spaces such as overhead bridges, sidewalks, bus stops, and traffic islands into appealing public spaces. For instance, a pedestrian bridge, beyond its functional use of crossing roads, can act as a lively space if upgraded with public space amenities. Greenery addition, shed, carved-out spaces for interaction, seating spaces, and artworks are a few strategies. Likewise, wide sidewalks can be transformed into green infrastructure networks constituting rest spaces, kiosks and drinking water fountains.Lastly, the most important step in public space management is to embrace the ‘Make it Simple’ design approach. This will significantly help tackle the issues of maintenance challenges, budgetary limitations and environmental degradation. Barrier concepts should be replaced with design and management solutions to resolve public space maintenance issues. Too many interventions and high-maintenance elements such as fountains, extravagant lighting and furniture can be intentionally avoided. Simple open ground composed of local vegetation, seating platforms, and minimal hardscape with durable materials like stones can also make beautiful parks. Providing open spaces is not enough in itself, though. For example, the Dharahara complex, although designed as a landmark public space, isolates itself from the surrounding context. Ultimately, public spaces should be physically well interconnected with existing urban networks to make them more accessible, practical, and contextual. \nNepali art exhibitions held in May-June 2024 at Kathmandu’s major galleries represent the diversity of the idioms of Nepali paintings executed in traditional, ethnic and modern forms. Visiting the exhibitions, closely observing the artworks, and interacting with the curators and some artists, I realised that the quest for the right idioms to express the major motifs of paintings continues to be the main thrust of the artists. In this article, I am alluding to the genre of paintings exhibited in galleries. I have attempted to review the paintings displayed at the exhibitions and briefly discuss the diverse modalities and practices of exhibitions, as well as the impact of audience-oriented activism. Though I have been writing on the diverse genres and forms of Nepali art like sculpture, architecture and installation-oriented works mainly curated in Nepal by Sangeeta Thapa through major events under such rubrics as “biennale and triennale”, I have mostly produced reviews of paintings over the decades. I have put my review writings in catalogues and journals. In recent years, I have been writing articles on art for the academic journal Sirjana of the Sirjana College of Fine Arts. Navindra Man Rajbhandari, an artist, art teacher, curator, and pedagogue, has been working earnestly to edit and publish this journal. I visited the painting exhibitions in the major galleries—two at the Nepal Art Council, Babarmahal and one each at the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts and the Siddhartha Art Gallery. Interestingly, all these exhibitions are audience-oriented. The painting exhibition practice often follows the rituals of cataloguing the works with simple introductions and price tags written somewhat half-heartedly. They also mention the mediums used by the painters, like oil, water, gouache and, very commonly, acrylic. From the early artists who were exposed to Western art to those of contemporary times in Nepal, all use the same mediums as artists anywhere in the world. These mediums are the universal shapers of the idioms of paintings. Nepali painters use the above-mentioned mediums and other admixtures according to their modern training and indigenous painting traditions. The evolution of colour paintings, especially oil, marks the presence of the audience or the clientele of paintings; it has become a commonly recognised subject. All came through modern education in art. Artists’ emotions and the consonance of cultural and aesthetic factors are commonly represented in such paintings.One eloquent example was seen at an art exhibition, “Deities of Nepal II”, held at the Nepal Art Council in May-June 2024. This exhibition, principally curated by the art academic Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, presented some remarkable paintings and their projection modalities. The diversity of the paintings executed according to the overt and covert themes of sacrality had one common element. Their choice of colours and hues and their delineation to create the exquisite beauty of the mythopoetic figural of the characters in the paintings was one eloquent feature. Modern painters also treated the divine figures and their aura in their non-figural works. I especially liked the modern techniques in these paintings about the deities. The thrust was experimental. Some artists, comparatively, made very good paintings; others were just cliché works, naturally. However, the common strength and feature of all the paintings that featured the iconography was what the brief brochure text says: The composition of “the deities intricately woven into a tapestry of philosophical and spiritual beliefs.” The other was the search for an appropriate style for projecting the spiritual motifs. The paintings appeared to establish a covenant with the audience, this time through a pricing pattern. Paintings were liberally priced; some were priced up to Rs4 million. And the remarkable matter was that some of these expensive paintings were “sold” to Nepali buyers. We should remember that the paintings were sold as works of art, not as pictures of religious iconographies. The entry of the modern audience into Nepali paintings is what matters here. John Berger, a great art critic, says that the painting itself should generate the buyer’s desirability through its touchable and visual attraction. I saw this covenant at this exhibition. The next display was the “National Exhibition of Fine Arts 2024”. This one presents a different perspective in my collection several decades’ glossy catalogues of the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts. This exhibition, curated by Devendra Kumar Kafle, aka Thumkeli, its member secretary, and other departmental academy members, presents a unique view of Nepali art. Kafle guided me through the variety of artworks and described the collection methods. The collection is based on the modality of sampling artworks of Indigenous and regional features and bringing them out to the national exhibition, which is a remarkable activity. The Academy has published small glossy catalogues for them. In his note, the Chancellor of the Academy, Naradmani Hartumchali, says this is a culmination of such exhibitions in all seven states. He stresses the need to bring art to a level where indigenous forms could be made a topic of political significance by evoking such features as representation and social transformation. I don't know of any well-researched discussions on this important topic initiated by any authentic institutions. But the exhibition speaks for itself. The current exhibition, “Threads of Simultaneity”, organised by ‘Sirjana 2024’ and mainly curated by Navindra Man Rajbhandari, exhibits 200 pieces of artwork executed by 28 artists at the Arts Council. Artist Rajbhandari revealed that the exhibition was an attempt to project a historicity of a combined nature of art activity shared entirely by the academic cohort of the institution. The exhibition features some works of the erstwhile principals Sashi Shah (2001-11), Krishna Manandhar (2011-17) and Madan Chitrakar (2018-22), and members of the Sirjana College of Arts like Vatsa Gopal Vaidya and other senior artists associated with the college one way or the other. Works of the young and senior artists are on display. I also want to recall yet another unique exhibition organised by Siddhartha Art Gallery, “Sawari Kathaharu: Art in Motion”, in May 2024. The concept of motion in art is presented by creating the art of motion, as in Ralph Lily Turner’s “Storms”, Hokusai’s “Great Waves”, Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica” and Sashi Shah’s “Darting Horses”, to take a few examples. Capturing the fixed images mounted on darting objects like vehicles and exhibiting them in a reputed gallery is designed to showcase experimental works and their appeal.May and June 2024 were eventful in the realm of Nepali art. I was struck by the variety of motifs and styles that show the performative mode of Nepali paintings. \nSouth Africa held their collective nerve to edge West Indies by three wickets under the Duckworth-Lewis method in a rain-disrupted shootout for a semi-final spot at the Twenty20 World Cup in Antigua on Sunday.The unbeaten Proteas joined England in the last four as Group 2 winners when Marco Jansen (21 not out) smashed a six down the ground off the first ball of the final over to get South Africa to their adjusted target of 123.Left-arm spinner Tabraiz Shamsi had earlier taken 3-27 as tournament co-hosts West Indies were restricted to 135-8 before the rainstorm swept in to stop play.Spinner Roston Chase (3-12) took three wickets late in the South African innings to set up a dramatic finish and give a glimmer of hope that West Indies might keep alive their quest for a third title.The other two semi-finalists will be decided on Monday when India and Australia meet in St Lucia and Afghanistan take on Bangladesh in St Vincent in the last two matches in the Super Eight stage.The South Africans won the toss and elect to bowl first in a decision that was quickly vindicated when danger men Shai Hope and Nicholas Pooran were dismissed inside the first two overs with just five runs on the board.Kyle Mayers, brought into the West Indies squad as an injury replacement on Saturday, steadied the innings in a partnership of 81 for the third wicket with Chase.Both had some fraught moments — Chase was dropped on 11 and Mayers survived an lbw call on review — before Shamsi separated them in the 12th over when Mayers slashed the ball to Tristan Stubbs at deep cover point to depart for 35.That was the last partnership of note in an innings of fits and starts, Chase (52) and Sherfane Rutherford (0) falling victim to Shamsi’s wrist spin, and Andre Russell thumping a couple of big sixes before being run out for 15. West Indies knew they were under-par and needed a big bowling effort and Russell gave them a great start.He struck with the first delivery of the innings to remove Reeza Hendricks caught behind down the leg side before having the other South Africa opener, Quinton de Kock, caught at backward square leg for 12 five deliveries later.The crowd at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium came to life but any momentum the West Indies had built was lost when the skies opened immediately and play was delayed for 90 minutes.Stubbs and his skipper Aiden Markram resumed on 15-2 and took the tally to 42 before local quick Alzarri Joseph struck with his second delivery to remove the latter for 18.Joseph’s pace did for Heinrich Klaasen (22) in the eighth over but the other West Indies bowlers were proving expensive and the South Africans were now just a run-a-ball away from their target.Chase came on in the 12th over to bowl David Miller for four and then sent back Stubbs (29) and Keshav Maharaj (2) and ensure the chase went into the 17th and final over. \nA third-minute goal from Christian Pulisic set the United States on their way to a 2-0 victory over Bolivia in their Group C opener at the Copa America on Sunday.Folarin Balogun added the second shortly before half-time and while the tournament hosts pushed for more goals in the second half they were unable to add to their tally.“The message to the team is it’s always important to win your first game,” US coach Gregg Berhalter said.“We talked about progressing our performance, improving our performance throughout the tournament, so I think it was a good starting point.”The US were aggressive right from the start against Bolivia, who have just one win in their last 31 Copa America matches.A missed opportunity by Balogun in the first 20 seconds was soon forgotten when Pulisic scored a spectacular goal from the edge of the box, beating Bolivian keeper Guillermo Viscarra.It was Pulisic’s 30th goal in 69 international matches. His first came against Bolivia in May 2016.The US doubled their lead in the 44th minute when Pulisic found Balogun and the striker ended his six-match goal drought in international matches with a low shot into the bottom corner.The hosts continued their onslaught with Ricardo Pepi, who came on as a substitute in the 65th minute, denied four times by Viscarra.“We tried to recover but of course, after the goal in minute three, it all went down the hill,” Bolivia coach Antonio Carlos Zago told reporters.“We should have competed a bit more, but we need to be aware that we had the host team in front of us. They are a strong national team and I am really happy with the effort made by the players.”The US next face CONCACAF rivals Panama on Thursday in Atlanta, while Uruguay will take on Bolivia in New Jersey. \nToday, the weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki will likely experience heavy rainfall in the hilly regions. At the same time, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning has also been forecast to occur across the country.The weather will remain the same until later tonight.Stay indoors as rainfall is expected to continue in all seven provinces with Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki likely to experience heavy rainfall.Monsoon has brought some much-needed respite to the scorching heat as temperatures have begun to cool down across the country. Dhangadi’s maximum temperature rose to 38.8 degrees Celsius while Jomsom recorded a minimum temperature of 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nHungary snatched a 100th-minute winner to beat Scotland 1-0 and put themselves in contention for a last-16 spot at the European Championship while condemning the Scots to yet another failure at a major tournament.Kevin Csoboth’s breakaway goal with almost the last kick of the match ensured Hungary finished third in Group A with three points while Scotland, yet to reach the knockout phase of either the Euros or World Cup, end in last place on two points.Hungary must wait to see whether they will qualify for the last 16 in one of the places reserved for the best four third-placed finishers.Their progress now rests on results from other groups going their way over the next three days. However, for now Marco Rossi’s side will revel in their dramatic victory that rescued their hopes just as they thought they were heading home.“It was unbelievable. We never achieved nothing in the past without big, big suffering. Today was no different. I think that we played the match that we needed to play,” Rossi said.“We created many options, many situations. We also left some (chances) to them. But overall, I think if I say that it was a deserved win, I’d be right,” he added.The match was a scrappy affair, with both teams struggling to exert any kind of control despite each being desperate for a win to continue their stay in Germany.Steve Clarke’s Scotland did dominate possession in the opening 25 minutes but could not fashion any clear-cut chances. Indeed, they had no shots at all in the first half despite having 61% of the ball. They ended the match without a shot on target.Hungary, meanwhile, grew into the game and began threatening on the break and making quick transitions, with captain Dominik Szoboszlai in particular threatening from set pieces.The midfielder’s freekick to the far post in the 41st minute was met by an unmarked Willi Orban but his poor header clipped the top of the bar from close range.Che Adams had Scotland’s first shot shortly after the break but he blasted it over.HORROR CLASHThe game was paused for a lengthy period in the 68th minute after a horrible clash between Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn and Barnabas Varga from another Szoboszlai freekick.Varga appeared to be knocked out cold and needed urgent treatment, and Hungary players erected blankets around him as a screen while they looked in distress, with Szoboszlai in tears.The forward was carried off the field on a stretcher to applause from the crowd. He was taken to Stuttgart Hospital, the Hungarian Football Federation said, adding that he was in a stable condition.“That gave us that extra bit, obviously we don’t ever want to see that on a football pitch but thankfully he’s conscious now,” Hungary midfielder Callum Styles said.Scotland had a strong appeal for a penalty dismissed in the 79th minute when substitute Stuart Armstrong ran on to the ball in the box but fell under contact from Orban. However, the referee did not consider it a foul.The game become more chaotic as both teams sought a winner.Gunn did well to save from Szoboszlai’s shot at the near post in the first minute of stoppage time, while Csoboth struck the post a minute later from the right when bearing down on goal.Scotland rushed forward and McTominay slid in at the near post to meet a low cross but the ball missed the target.It was from a Scottish corner that Hungary turned into a rapid counter-attack up the pitch. A long cutback across the box fell to Csoboth who slotted the ball in, sending Hungary fans delirious and players from their bench running over in celebration.Scotland could only look on dejected as their bid to make history ended in dramatic fashion to the latest goal ever scored at a European Championship in regulation time.“Tonight’s devastating, the lads are absolutely gutted. Yeah but it’s up to us to pick them up and that will happen slowly but surely,” Scotland captain Andy Robertson said.“But thank you to the country because we felt everyone behind us, and we knew the excitement back home—sorry for letting you down.” \nPrivate dairies have requested subsidised loans from the government to settle farmers' dues, amounting to nearly Rs3 billion, amid the ongoing dairy sector slump.They have also requested the government to permit them to export dairy products such as powdered milk, butter, and cheese, as consumption within the country has remained subdued. As a result, the stock has been piling up. Recently, the government partially bailed out the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation by providing Rs300 million in soft loans. After dairy farmers started protests, officials privy to the matter told the Post that the government is preparing to release another Rs600 million to the corporation. The corporation had in February said that the dairy industry was suffering from a recession and hoped that sales would increase in summer. But it didn’t.Both state-owned and private dairy companies said that the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for months.“We are unable to pay farmers due to unsold products. The stock, too, is huge,” said Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association.“So we have requested the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development to provide a soft loan keeping our dairy products as collateral. We have also requested the government to open up exports so that we can sell our products and become able to pay the farmers.” The association is scheduled to meet the agriculture minister on Monday. “We hope that our request will be heeded,” said Dahal. The association has requested a soft loan for more than 50 percent of its remaining stock. Private dairies have stocks of powdered milk and butter worth Rs5 billion, said Dahal.According to the association, the committee formed by the agriculture ministry to study the payment issues of dairy farmers found that around Rs4.50 billion is due to be paid by dairies to the farmers. The amount was previously Rs7 billion.This shows that payment is being made gradually, Dahal said. “But that is not sufficient.”Consumer demand for milk and other dairy-related products declined last year, with the government hiking the price of raw milk to benefit and encourage more dairy farmers to join the sector. However, the unscientific hike hit demand amid the people's declining incomes due to the economic slowdown.Regarding price reduction to increase consumption, Dahal said private diaries have a high cost of production, so it will not be possible to reduce the price.The government also imposes VAT on dairy products like ghee, ice cream, and cheese. “If the VAT is waived, prices will come down, which can boost the sales,” said Dahal.According to the association, nearly 1 million litres of milk comes from the formal sector, which implies a daily transaction of Rs70 million.“If the soft loan is provided and export is permitted, we will be able to clear all the farmers' dues by September,” Dahal said.Dairy entrepreneurs said that the butter stock is gradually being cleared, and milk production has declined, balancing stock and output.Last Wednesday, dairy farmers demonstrated outside the Lainchaur-based Dairy Development Corporation, demanding immediate settlement of their outstanding payments. Police arrested dozens of dairy farmers during the protest.Around 50 farmers were arrested as they attempted to picket the corporation. According to the association, 600,000 families are associated with the dairy sector, contributing 45,000 jobs. More than Rs60 million cash flows from urban to rural areas daily, and the government collects revenue of more than Rs2 billion monthly.“The agriculture ministry has called us for a meeting on Monday,” said Amar Bahadur Kunwar, president of the Central Dairy Cooperatives Association. “Both private and government dairy industries have more than Rs5 billion in dues to be paid to dairy farmers.”Dahal said the state-owned corporation alone has outstanding dues of Rs2 billion to the dairy farmers.The corporation even issued a public notice on June 10 inviting bids to sell its butter and powdered milk. As per the notice, it planned to sell 200 tonnes of butter (15kg block) and 300 tonnes of skimmed powdered milk (25kg bag).In another notice on Sunday, the corporation fixed the skimmed powdered milk rates. The country currently produces more than 6 million litres of milk daily. The corporation purchases around 25 percent of it. \nSummaryHosts Germany top Euro 2024 Group A after 1-1 drawSwiss forward Ndoye gave his side a first half leadFuellkrug equalised for Germany in the 92nd minuteSwitzerland are also into the last 16 as runners-up in Group AStriker Niclas Fuellkrug scored a dramatic stoppage time equaliser as hosts Germany rescued a point after a 1-1 draw with Switzerland on Sunday to seal top spot in Group A and maintain their momentum going into the last-16 of Euro 2024.Swiss forward Dan Ndoye had threatened to spoil the party with a first half opener, but Germany, who had already sealed a knockout place before kickoff, are now on a seven-game unbeaten run stretching back to November and kept plugging away until the equaliser eventually came through Fuellkrug’s header.The home side had a goal disallowed and several penalty appeals rejected by Italian referee Daniele Orsato, and it looked to be a frustrating night before Fuellkrug finished one of their 18 attempts at goal in a feverish atmosphere in Frankfurt.It denied the Swiss what would have been a second win over Germany in 22 competitive matches dating back to 1959, but their passage through to the last-16 is also secure.Germany top the pool with seven points from their three games, two ahead of Switzerland, while Hungary (three points) must wait to see if they will advance as one of the best third-placed teams following a 1-0 win over eliminated Scotland (one).“Of course, we would have liked to win the game and to play great football,” Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan said. “But I think you also need games like that during a tournament. And that can also be a real strength for the next games, hopefully.”Germany thought they had the lead on 17 minutes when Robert Andrich’s shot from 30-yards somehow beat Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer at his near post but the latter’s blushes were spared when the goal was ruled out for a foul by Jamal Musiala.Instead it was the Swiss who scored just before the half-hour mark. Musiala was bundled off the ball in midfield and when Remo Freuler was found on the left-hand side of the box, his low cross was turned into the roof of the net by Ndoye.The home side created numerous chances as they camped in the Swiss half, but after Kai Havertz had wasted several, Fuellkrug rose highest to head in David Raum’s cross in the 92nd minute and preserve their unbeaten start to their home championship.“I think when you see the Germans celebrating, we can be proud of ourselves,” Swiss captain Granit Xhaka told SRF. “It’s not easy against a team like that. Nevertheless, the late equaliser hurts.“Everyone fought for each other and ran for each other. We have to push ourselves to the limit. Then we can beat anyone. We have taken the first step and are now looking forward to the round of 16.”Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann picked the same starting XI for the third game in a row, but will be forced into at least one change for the last-16 after Jonathan Tah picked up a second yellow card of the group stages and will be suspended.Whether Havertz did enough to keep his starting place remans to be seen, with Germany looking more threatening when Fuellkrug came on to score his 13th international goal in 19 caps, only six of which he has started. \nPace bowler Chris Jordan celebrated his return to the England side with a hat-trick on Sunday in the land of his birth to set the defending champions up for a crushing 10 wicket victory over the United States and a place in the T20 World Cup semi-finals.After dismissing the United States for 115 from 18.5 overs in their final Super Eight group match, England captain Jos Butler (83 not out), who effortlessly lofted five sixes in an over off left-arm slow bowler Harmeet Singh, and Phil Salt (25 not out), stroked their way to 117 without loss from 9.4 overs.After being asked to bat first, the United States lost their last five wickets in six balls.Jordan, who had replaced Mark Wood, began the 19th over by having Corey Anderson caught at long-on by Harry Brook. Two balls later he clean bowled Ali Khan, then trapped Nosthush Kenjige lbw and bowled Saurabh Netravalkar to complete his hat-trick, all three falling without scoring.Jordan finished with four for 10 from 2.5 overs following another masterclass in wrist spin from Adil Rashid, who was named man-of-the-match.Rashid took two for 13 from his four overs, including the prize wicket of captain Aaron Jones who was bowled for 10 completely misjudging a googly which spun back to hit his stumps.Nitish Kumar top-scored with 30 and former New Zealand all-rounder Anderson struck some belligerent shots late in the innings but it was all far too little too late on an excellent batting surface at the Kensington Oval.“Very nice to do this at a special place like this,” said Jordan. “I thought we worked out the conditions well. Rashid came on and controlled one end and the way Livi (Liam Livingstone) bowled set the game up.”After Butler won the toss and opted to field first Andries Gous flicked the fourth ball from left-arm paceman Reece Topley’s first over for a six over the fine leg boundary but was caught for eight attempting a similar shot from the final delivery.Jofra Archer, also representing England in the country of his birth, opened from the other end, conceding a six when Kumar was late on his hook shot and the ball took the top edge and flew over the third man boundary.A more authentic shot from Topley’s second over soared over long-on for another six.Left-arm paceman Sam Curran took over from Archer and struck with his third ball, dismissing Steven Taylor caught at point by Moeen Ali for 12, his 50th ODI wicket.Rashid then bowled Jones and at the halfway stage the American side were precariously placed at 65 for three. They were never to recover as Livingstone, with his mixture of wrist and finger spin, was almost as effective from the other end, capturing one for 24 from his four overs.“I thought if we could bring our intensity we’d be too good,” Butler said. “We’ve got great options, we wanted to bring Chris Jordan back, he adds a bit of depth with his batting capabilities as well. A world cup hat-trick is a great effort.” \nSushil Pyakurel, the ambassador nominee to South Korea, has declined the position. Pyakurel has sent a letter to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, requesting the withdrawal of his nomination.In a statement on Sunday, Pyakurel said he had submitted a letter to the Office of the Prime Minister requesting the government to withdraw his nomination.Pyakurel said he rejected the post because he was not consulted before the nomination, and the government did not consider the criteria set by previous governments.“I am surprised by the government’s practice of not having prior discussions on the background, efficiency, interests, and knowledge of the political, economic, and social status of the country concerned before assigning the responsibility of a post representing a country, such as an ambassador,” Pyakurel said in the statement. “In this context, I see the need for serious discussion on the criteria set by previous governments regarding the appointment of ambassadors, the rationale behind parliamentary hearings, and the tenure of ambassadors.”The Cabinet meeting on Friday had recommended ambassadors for eight countries. Former member of the National Human Rights Commission, Pyakurel, was recommended for South Korea, according to the Cabinet decision. Pyakurel, who also served as an adviser to the second President of the country, Bidya Devi Bhandari, was supposed to replace Jyoti Pyakurel Bhandari. \nIsraeli tanks advanced to the edge of the Mawasi displaced persons’ camp in the northwest of the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Sunday in fierce fighting with Hamas-led fighters, residents said.Images of two Israeli tanks stationed on a hilltop overlooking the coastal area went viral on social media, but Reuters could not independently verify them.“The fighting with the resistance has been intense. The occupation forces are overlooking the Mawasi area now, which forced families there to head for Khan Younis,” said one resident, who asked not to be named, on a chat app.More than eight months into Israel’s war in the Hamas-administered Palestinian enclave, its advance is focused on the two areas its forces have yet to seize: Rafah on Gaza’s southern tip and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre.Residents said Israeli tanks had pushed deeper into western and northern Rafah in recent days, blowing up dozens of houses.The Israeli military said it was continuing “intelligence-based, targeted operations” in the Rafah area and had located weapons stores and tunnel shafts, and killed Palestinian gunmen.The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad movement said their fighters had attacked Israeli forces in Rafah with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs and pre-planted explosive devices.Elsewhere, an Israeli airstrike killed eight Palestinians in Sabra, a suburb of Gaza City in the north, and another strike killed two people in Nuseirat in central Gaza.The military said it had struck dozens of targets throughout the Strip.On Saturday, Palestinian health officials said at least 40 Palestinians had been killed in separate Israeli strikes in some northern Gaza districts, where the Israeli army said it had attacked Hamas’s military infrastructure. Hamas said the targets were the civilian population.In Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, health officials at Kamal Adwan Hospital said a baby had died of malnutrition, taking the the number of children dead of malnutrition or dehydration since Oct. 7 to at least 30, a number that health officials say reflects under-recording.Israel’s ground and air campaign in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute. \nLocal governments start registering victims of conflict-related sexual violence, drawing objections over legality and confidentiality concerns, despite plans for compensation and support amid ongoing neglect by state authorities.\nNepal-India relations, rooted in the Treaty of Sugauli, have remained complex due to geopolitics, geoeconomics, and Nepal's strategic autonomy, with India cautious about altering the existing structure and Nepal focusing on development and cooperation while navigating border disputes and trade imbalances.\nThe day I met Rima (name changed), it was already late morning and she was anxious. There were around seven women in a small room. She rocked nervously and reiterated that she did not want to talk. We told her she did not have to. An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rima’s body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rima’s house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rima’s quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepal’s decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepal’s conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepal’s history.Devi Khadka’s story had haunted me for years. I’d read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known ‘feminist’ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, it’s easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, “I’ve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.” Yet, some from Nepal’s transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her “political” and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. I’ve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, she’s been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepal’s transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as well—a way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepal’s transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepal’s wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal player—not a victim any more, but a leader—will strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist. Her film ‘Devi’ is screening at the DocEdge Festival in New Zealand in June. \nNepal's remarkable performance against South Africa in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup earned global praise despite their heartbreaking one-run defeat, showcasing their fighting spirit and impressive bowling led by Dipendra Singh Airee and Kushal Bhurtel.\nThe process of enacting a separate air carriers’ liability and insurance legislation for domestic carriers has stalled yet again.On March 1, the Cabinet approved the tourism ministry’s proposal to prepare a draft bill on domestic air carriers’ liability and insurance.This was done years after Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999, which makes international airlines liable in case of death or injury to passengers. Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. “With this latest development, the process will now move ahead.”He said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. “Following their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.” The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say. Some ministers held their positions for long enough but were not bothered about pushing the bill.The bill could not be registered as Parliament was prorogued several times in the past.As a result of the delay, passengers who died in the Yeti Airlines plane crash in January 2023 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees.The Yeti Airlines tragedy in Pokhara was Nepal’s 104th crash and the third biggest in terms of casualties.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, more than 900 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.The biggest air accident took place on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Earlier, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.Nepal’s domestic airlines—nine fixed-wing operators and 12 helicopters—flew 4.15 million passengers in 2023. \nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Following the trip spanning over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites, the Post presents a travel guide to Sri Lanka. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nAnanda Mohan Bhattarai served as a justice of the Supreme Court of Nepal from August 2016 to June 2024. Before his tenure at the Supreme Court, he held positions as a judge in various district and high courts across Nepal. Bhattarai is also the author of four books focusing on law and environmental issues.In a conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Bhattarai discusses the interplay between law and literature, his reading habits, and book recommendations for aspiring lawyers.How is law and literature related?Law and literature share an intrinsic relationship. From an academic perspective, jurisprudence, often known as the philosophy of law, includes both fields of law and literature. A saying goes, “Asal faisala asal sahitya ho,” (True judgement is true literature). The ones who are adept in language have been able to become luminary judges. One example is the former Chief Justice of India, VR Krishna Iyer. He had an English literature background.While law is not entirely an open-ended discourse like literature, from a literary perspective, it can sometimes exhibit open-ended qualities. The flexibility in interpretation from a literary perspective allows for changes in legal decisions over time. This is why certain legal decisions may evolve or change as perspectives and contexts shift.How did you start reading?When I became a literature student, my love for literature developed. I have a special inclination for the works of acclaimed poets such as Hari Bhakta Katuwal and Ashesh Malla. My upbringing also deepened my love for reading. My brother and I used to recite Bhupi Sherchan’s poems, and my mother would recite Satyakli’s verses. It was a tradition to read the Ramayana every day in the evening as well.I was also fascinated by the works of William Shakespeare and Francis Bacon. Among Nepali writers, the works of Samrat Upadhya and Manjushree Thapa’s ‘Forget Kathmandu’ have left an impression on me. Why should law students read?Reading is crucial to establishing a conceptual clarity of any subject matter. After one develops conceptual clarity, it becomes easy to analyse the matter. For instance, when one becomes well-versed in the subjugation caused by patriarchy, it becomes easier to dissect the issue within the legal framework. A few years ago, the issue of women’s right to parental property sparked significant debate, with some arguing against granting these rights. However, when viewed from the perspective of rights and through the lens of the jurisprudence of equality, such debates become clearer and more justified. Therefore, reading and studying these perspectives greatly benefits law students.How do you manage time to read? When you have a demanding job, it is difficult to find the time to read. Your workload keeps you from relishing leisure activities. However, for me, there has always been a drive to read books beyond my field of expertise.I believe time does not come in blocks, instead, it flows continuously and is experienced moment by moment. Thus, even if I get an hour or so off from work, I use it to read books.Has reading influenced your perspective when making judicial decisions? I have relied on information in many books, which have shaped my case decisions to some extent. One such influential book is ‘Hiti Pranali’ by Padma Sunder Joshi. The book’s well-researched content provided me with a deeper understanding of the environmental and cultural aspects of the Kathmandu Valley's water system. Similarly, Amartya Sen’s ‘Development as Freedom’ and ‘Theory of Justice’ have provided a practical framework for judicial decisions.Which book has had the most impact on you? Literary theories helped me understand jurisprudence from a philosophical angle. Stanley Fish’s reader-response theory and the writings of Jacques Derrida have significantly shaped my thought process in the legal field.What would you suggest to young lawyers?I encourage young lawyers to consider both jurisprudence and constitutional law as essential courses and to read extensively on these topics. Additionally, human rights law is an emerging field with many new areas to explore. Studying this field helps humanise the law, making it easier to become a judge by offering fresh perspectives. For instance, understanding that “rape is not just a crime; it is an attack on the dignity of a human being” allows us to see people as human beings and respect their dignity.When studying constitutional Law, we integrate human rights and constitutional law within the framework of rights. A strong foundation in these subjects, along with good research skills, helps law students develop an effective approach.In our evolving system, which values comparative law, it is important to engage with various streams of thought rather than focusing on just one.Ananda Mohan Bhattarai’s Book recommendations: Nepali Kanuni Itihas ko RuprekhaAuthor: Rewati Raman Khanal Publisher: Pairavi Book HouseYear: 2002Rich in information and shedding light on Nepal’s political, social, and cultural dynamics, it is an insightful account of events that unfolded during the Rana regime.

Dal Bahadur’s wife and three children fell ill and are receiving treatment at a hospital. The Chepang family consumed mushroom curry on Saturday evening that they had collected from a nearby forest.  \nIt’s been 10 days since Upendra Yadav got reelected Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal) chair unopposed from the party’s general convention held in Janakpur.Nearly two weeks since the inauguration of the convention and the election of the party chairman, the JSP-Nepal, however, hasn’t elected any other office bearers and central committee members so far.Incumbent chief Yadav was declared the party chair unopposed after no one threw their hat in the ring.After Yadav’s reelection on June 12, the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13, was halted saying that all other leaders would be chosen in consensus.Before the party decided to halt the election process, 23 candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons; six candidates were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for a treasurer position; and 34 leaders had filed their candidacies for seven positions of secretary.To the question of whether the leaders had deferred the election finding it difficult to pick individuals for available positions, party insiders gave multiple answers.A leader linked the leadership election deferral to the party split in the first week of May.A group of JSP-Nepal leaders split the party and formed the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission registered the new outfit on May 6.The JSP-Nepal led by Yadav on May 13 moved the Supreme Court, accusing the commission of recognising its splinter group as a party without the legal basis.Yadav, in his petition, claimed that the commission had registered the party even without the required 40 percent central members on its side. The top court has ordered the relevant authorities to stall the process until the verdict and the case is still sub judice.The uncertainty prevents the newly formed Rai-led party from expediting its activities in a formal way. Seven of the 12 JSP-Nepal lawmakers in the federal parliament and 30 of the 406 party central committee members are with Rai.The new outfit’s plan to build its organisation at the provincial and local levels is in limbo due to the delayed court process. Leaders from the new party claimed that a large number of leaders and cadres are waiting to join the new organisation. Moreover, they are planning to embrace those aspirants of top positions when they are denied posts in central bodies. Observers of Madhesh politics claimed that the JSP-Nepal was unable to complete its election process with the splinter faction eying to lure its members. However, Manish Kumar Suman, one of the aspirants for general secretary in the JSP-Nepal, denied it. He claimed that the stalled general convention process, including the selection of leaders for office bearers positions, would be completed within a week.“As per the election commission deadline, we have to complete the whole general convention process within 35 days,” Suman told the Post. “We will complete the process before the timeframe.”Some political observers say the JSP-Nepal went for the general convention only out of the constitutional compulsion. If the party really wanted to follow the democratic process, it should have allowed the election process to go forward.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates the political parties to hold the general convention at least once in five years.“Upendra Yadav has made himself the JSP-Nepal patron,” Shiva Chandra Chaudhary, a Madhesh political observer, told the Post. “He can select leaders loyal to him, having been reelected the party chairman. So he stalled the democratic process.”On the other hand, the new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—too has failed to give momentum to the party building process in the six weeks since its inception.The new outfit has gained prominence apparently with the support of the ruling coalition. The Election Commission swiftly registered the new party on May 6 with the name similar to the mother party despite legal ambiguities in the process. The JSP joined the ruling coalition immediately after its formation and supported the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government. The Rai-led party has been given a Cabinet minister and a state minister. On Saturday, when the Cabinet made recommendations for ambassadors to eight countries, two nominations went to the new outfit’s supporters. Ambassadors for Saudi Arabia and Spain were appointed in the JSP quotas. Days after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support to the government, the Rai-led JSP gave its trust vote to Dahal and it supported the government in its policies and programmes.Lawmaker Sushila Shrestha of the JSP tried to downplay the difficulties saying that they were carrying out the party’s activities quietly. “We are engaged in several activities to strengthen the newly formed party, but we are not visible in the media,” Shrestha claimed. “Next Saturday and Sunday, our party’s central committee is meeting.” Shrestha claimed that her party is stronger than the JSP-Nepal in the provinces except for Madhesh. “We have been holding the meetings of provincial committees and are working to make our presence felt in Madhesh Province too.”Though Shrestha claims there are a number of activities within the party, political observers believe that its activities are stagnant due to the case sub judice in the court. “A writ petition in the Supreme Court related to the party split has stalled the new party formation,” Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst, told the Post.Yadav has claimed the commission registered the party despite its failure to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a party split. JSP-Nepal had 406 central committee members at the time of the party split, but the splinter group only had 30 central members with it.The newly formed JSP was registered amid a legal void as the Political Parties Act 2017 was replaced by an ordinance but not revived afterwards. According to the Act, a group of dissidents can split a party and form a new one if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members and at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, leaving no legal basis for a party split. On June 9, the Supreme Court referred the dispute related to the party to the full bench. \nProtests by employees at the Parliament Secretariat have affected deliberations on the national budget.On Wednesday, eight ministers were scheduled to answer lawmakers’ concerns about the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 at the House of Representatives. However, the meeting had to be adjourned even before one minister completed his reply due to the employees' non-cooperation.The episode replayed on Thursday. Though seven ministers were scheduled to answer lawmakers' concerns, only four could respond. United under the Employee Union of the Federal Parliament Secretariat, the officials have been staging a series of protests. Starting Wednesday, they stopped working beyond office hours demanding allowances for overtime and odd hours.The agitators say they will not work before and after office hours until they are paid allowances. Office hours start at 10 am and end at 5 pm.“We will not be working extra hours without additional payment,” Govinda Belbase, chairperson of the union, told the Post. “Our non-cooperation continues.”As the protest started to affect House proceedings, Speaker Devraj Ghimire, together with Narayan Dahal, chairperson of the National Assembly, held discussions with Barsha Man Pun, the finance minister, on Thursday to address the demands. However, Pun did not respond positively.Shekhar Adhikari, Ghimire's press advisor, said the Speaker has taken the staff's non-cooperation seriously as it has hampered the House business. The Speaker has also raised the issue with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, but to no avail.Even before the formulation of the national budget, the Parliament staff had drawn the attention of Ghimire, Dahal, and Padma Prasad Panday, the general secretary at the Parliament Secretariat. Ghimire had requested Pun to increase Parliament’s budget and resume the allowances for extra work his staff performed.However, the money was not allocated in the national budget presented in Parliament on May 28, prompting the protest.Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the secretariat, said the protest has hit the House calendar. \"The deliberations in the budget are not moving as planned,\" Giri told the Post, adding that the discussions between the Speaker and the government have not yielded positive results. Parliament has less than three weeks to complete the deliberations on the budget and get it endorsed from both houses, Giri said. All the budget-related bills need to be authenticated by the President before mid-July. The new fiscal year starts on July 16.The budget-related bills are scheduled to be endorsed by the lower house on June 27, but that doesn't look possible following the protests.On normal days, meetings of the House committees were held in the morning while parliamentary meetings were conducted after 11 am. As the parliament staff have stopped working in the morning, no committee meetings have been held in the morning for days now.Parliament Secretariat staff claim that they have to work regularly before and after office hours without being paid a penny beyond their regular salary, while lawmakers get travel and meeting allowances, in addition to their salary, for attending the House and parliamentary committee meetings.Belbase said it has been three years since the government stopped paying the allowance.Belbase said that the House meetings, which generally start at 11 am, run beyond 5 pm regularly. The staff must arrive at least an hour before the meeting for preparations and stay an additional hour after the meeting.Protestors say they had been working over 10 hours a day for months without additional payment.It was an injustice to them and against the ILO Convention of 1930, to which Nepal is a party, they say.Article 3 of the Convention states, “The hours of work of persons to whom this Convention applies shall not exceed forty-eight hours in the week and eight hours in the day, except as hereinafter otherwise provided.”The allowance for government staff was withdrawn following the Covid-19 pandemic. The government resumed the allowance in some state agencies, including the Election Commission and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, but not in Parliament, said Belbase.“We are not going to compromise this time,” Belbase said. “This is a fight for justice.” \nThe news of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari renewing her party membership has become a matter of discussion in Parliament. The ninth general convention of CPN-UML held in Kathmandu in 2014 had elected Bhandari a vice-chair of the party. After Bhandari was elected the country’s President in 2015, she gave up the party membership as mandated by the constitution. She secured the second term in the presidential election following the 2017 parliamentary polls. After Ramchandra Paudel replaced her as the head of state last year, Bhandari has been relieved of duties and has been enjoying state facilities as a former President. Parliamentarians have started asking: Can a former head of state who has been enjoying state perks return to active politics? They have also demanded that the government look into the services provided to the former head of state. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Nepali Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada, who chairs the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, said the government should clarify whether former President Bhandari qualifies for state benefits after renewing her UML membership. Media reports suggest the former President renewed her membership in a political party, Khatiwada said. “After the party membership renewal, can she still enjoy state benefits?” he questioned. “What is the state’s take on this?”He also demanded the government inform Parliament about the arrangements made for the former President.The Constitution of Nepal is silent on whether a former head of state can engage in active politics after leaving office.However, this is a question of constitutional ethics, says Raman Shrestha, a former attorney general.“If we look at the examples of other countries, a former head of state does not return to active politics, let alone by reclaiming the membership of a party,” Shrestha told the Post. “It is a question of ethics.” CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Pampha Bhusal said the question of morality only applies to the one who sticks to it. “If we see the history of Nepal, we find that a person who has become the prime minister has become an ambassador and taken other responsibilities,” Bhusal told the Post. “It is a personal decision whether to rejoin active politics after serving as the head of state. Let’s not make too big a fuss about this.”However, political observers and analysts say that when a person who has been receiving state benefits for their former role returns to active politics, it raises serious questions about that person and the party that gives the membership. Nepal has yet to formulate policies on the perks and benefits to be provided to a former head of state. The current practice is for the Cabinet to decide on such perks, according to an officer at the home ministry. “The former President gets a monthly stipend of Rs50,000. Another Rs200,000 is provided in monthly house rent,” said the officer. “If the former President has a house of their own in Kathmandu and decides to stay there, they get Rs100,000 a month in maintenance expenses.” They also get security personnel. However, the ministry officer refused to disclose the ‘sensitive’ security details. Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of Nepal, claims funds for housing from the government whereas Bhandari lives in her own house. Even before retiring from presidential duties, Bhandari had decided that she would go back to her own house, fuelling speculations about her plan to return to active politics. Bhandari is the widow of the late communist leader Madan Bhandari, who provided the ideological line to the UML. Most of Nepal’s major communist forces, the Maoist Centre led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the CPN (Unified Socialist) led by Madhav Kumar Nepal acknowledge the role of Madan Bhandari in advancing the communist cause in the country.UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, Nepal and Dahal have once been together in a single political party after the 2017 elections. Whenever the communist forces form a coalition, as the three parties are doing now, the issue of their strategic partnership comes up.The Nepal Communist Party (NCP), as the unified force was called, saw a split when Dahal and Oli jointly chaired it but Oli is often criticised for being chiefly responsible for the unified party’s failure given his leadership style. Now when the three forces are rumoured to be planning to contest the 2027 elections on the same side, the chances of former President Bhandari returning to politics to potentially unite the parties as a leader acceptable to all are said to be high.Bhandari reportedly renewed party membership on the Nepali New Year day, more than two months ago. Madhav Dhungel, the secretary of the central organisation department of the UML, took to social media on June 18 to clarify the issue. “There is no doubt that Bhandari became President as a UML leader. But then she had to distance herself from the party, and she did so,” reads the facebook status of Dhungel. “However, she has the right to provide guardianship to the whole country, the Nepali people and the political party that she nurtured.”“Whether to return to active politics is a personal matter. If she [Bhandari] does so, she won’t do so on the sly,” Dhungel writes. “If she desires to be active in politics, she will undoubtedly do so in the UML.”On the question of Bhandari renewing her party membership, Kashinath Adhikari, the head of the party’s central organisation department, said he was not in a position to give a definite answer. “Membership in our party is renewed at the start of the [Nepali] new year,” Adhikari told the Post. “Who all have renewed party membership will be known only after going through the final list of those doing so in the given time.”  \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Thursday expressed his deep frustration over the low attendance of lawmakers and senior party leaders during his question and answer session in the House of Representatives.While low attendance in the House is not uncommon, as per the tradition, almost all lawmakers and senior leaders, except those with urgent commitments, are present when the prime minister speaks in the House or organises a question-answer session on contemporary issues.“The absence does not undermine the post of prime minister, it undermines the lawmakers themselves,” said Prime Minister Dahal, who was visibly distressed. Among those notably absent were top leaders including Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli and CPN (Unified Socialist) chief Madhav Nepal, as well as several Cabinet ministers and dozens of lawmakers from ruling and opposition benches. Out of 22, only eight ministers were present. A Nepali Congress leader said that Congress President Deuba was briefly present in the House, but had to leave due to health issues. But other senior Congress leaders and office bearers were notably absent. Similarly, CPN-UML chair Oli visited Parliament but did not enter the House. He left Parliament premises before the prime minister started speaking. Oli attended another function in the Capital.Several Cabinet ministers including two deputy prime ministers Raghubir Mahaseth and Narayan Kaji Shrestha were also absent when Dahal was responding to lawmakers’ queries. “There has been a tradition in Parliament that leaders of both opposition and ruling parties should be present when the prime minister speaks. The absence does not undermine the prime minister but rather the parliamentarians themselves. Except in emergencies, leaders of ruling and opposition parties, ministers and lawmakers traditionally attend the meeting where the prime minister speaks. But this tradition is being watered down, day by day. This definitely does not undermine the prime minister’s position,” said Dahal.The visibly upset prime minister said before concluding his statement by warning that “if such a trend continues, it is a gross insult to all of us.”Before making this statement, the prime minister answered questions from eleven lawmakers on various issues. He also discussed his recent visit to India and President Ramchandra Paudel’s visits to Switzerland and Germany.Prime Minister Dahal, earlier this month, attended the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. He also held talks with Indian President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Modi, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, among other top officials.During his meetings with Modi and Jaishanker, Dahal said, issues related to strengthening bilateral ties, activating bilateral mechanisms between Nepal and India, and increasing Indian investment in Nepal, among others, were discussed.While speaking in the House, the prime minister expressed his dissatisfaction with budgetary allocations stating the ministers did not follow his directives.“Ministers should take the prime minister’s directive seriously while selecting projects and programmes,” said Dahal. “Despite my directives, small and micro projects are still being included in the budget. You will be ministers and prime ministers tomorrow, so we need to correct these practices.”“Despite tall promises, this fiscal year’s budget has several small and micro level projects below Rs30 million. The government had earlier promised to entrust projects and programmes under Rs30 million to provincial governments. I am not fully satisfied with the budget and its provisions.”While responding to lawmakers’ queries, the prime minister said that those responsible for the Tikapur massacre would be punished. As many as eight people, including a toddler and seven policemen, were killed by protesters on August 24, 2015 in the run up to the promulgation of the constitution. Dahal also assured that the government is committed to ensuring the identity and social and economic empowerment of the Tharus and other socially and economically marginalised communities.The prime minister also informed Parliament that Nepal and India are seriously considering two dedicated religious corridors—the Ramayana and Buddha circuits—to promote religious tourism.“We have ensured the budget for developing Ramayana, Shiva, Buddha, and Kirat circuits,” said the prime minister. “Fifteen different religious sites between Nepal and India will be connected under the Ramayana and Buddha circuits.” Nepal and India have already reached agreements and understandings on developing these circuits.Similarly, the prime minister stated that the government is committed to making ambassadorial appointments more orderly, dignified, transparent, and performance-based. He also defended the government’s recent decision to recall Nepal’s ambassadors from several countries, stating that the decision was in line with the constitution.The recent decision to recall envoys from 11 nations created quite an uproar in various quarters.“The government is committed to using diplomatic missions and envoys in the best interest of the nation,” he said. “As per the Ambassador Appointment Directive, 2015, the envoys can be recalled before completing their terms, if necessary.”“Typically, only those appointed under political quota are recalled immediately after a change in coalition,” the prime minister said. “But this time, the envoys remained in their posts for more than three months after a change in the ruling coalition.”Dahal said this was proof of how the government was serious about the issue.Government picks some ambassadors under political quota based on recommendations from coalition partners while it selects some career diplomats from within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Talking about his recent India visit, Prime Minister Dahal also said that there were discussions on effective implementation of the agreements reached between the two South Asian neighbours.According to Dahal, among the issues discussed during a meeting with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, were strengthening Nepal-India relations, implementation of past agreements, and bilateral discussions—including border disputes. “There were serious discussions on the implementation of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, Arun Hydropower Project and cooperation in the agricultural sector,” Dahal said.Likewise, the prime minister stated that the government has initiated the formation of a high-level committee to address the challenges being faced by cooperatives.After the committee’s input and suggestions, crisis-ridden cooperatives will be identified and action initiated to return deposits and manage their assets.Dahal said that more than Rs772.44 million has already been refunded to the victims of cooperatives.Addressing the meeting, Dahal stated that 59,587 individuals, affected by cooperatives, had filed complaints alleging embezzlement of deposits totalling Rs36.28 billion. Of this, the government has so far paid back Rs 772.44 million.The prime minister added that the government had declared 20 different cooperatives as ‘crisis-ridden’ and that the process of refunding affected depositors was being facilitated through the Crisis-ridden Cooperative Management Committee.Dahal also mentioned that efforts are underway for a separate legal procedure to establish an independent regulatory body to protect cooperative savings.“The government is aware of the problems faced by cooperatives and is serious about addressing them. Various efforts have been made to implement the suggestions of the high-level task force and agreements reached with the cooperative victims under the coordination of the National Planning Commission last year,” he said.Prime Minister Dahal said that a committee had also been formed at the provincial and local levels to solve the problems of those affected by cooperatives.A law to establish an authority to regulate and supervise large-scale cooperatives is also being drafted, Dahal said. “Not all cooperatives are in trouble. Many have helped lift people’s livelihoods while operating based on established international practices and as per the law,” Dahal said.He added that despite the significant increase in the number of cooperatives, there were plenty of shortcomings in their qualitative improvement. \nWith the general convention of the CPN (Unified Socialist) approaching closer, top leaders of the party have intensified their preparations and lobbying for the top posts.As they expedite their lobbying through various informal channels, the party leaders in their formal speeches are emphasising the need of electing the leadership through a consensus.Senior leader Jhalanath Khanal did the same on Monday.A group of CPN-UML leaders led by Madhav Kumar Nepal, the party’s former chief, split the country’s largest communist party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) in August 2021. They split the party protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice.Following a poor performance in the 2022 elections, where it failed even to secure the status of the national party, the CPN (Unified Socialist) is now struggling to retain party members. Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders are finding it difficult even to stop its members from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.Amid the diminishing influence, the party is gearing up for the general convention scheduled for June 30 to July 4 in Kathmandu.If the claims recently made by the leaders are anything to go by, the two former prime ministers—Nepal and Khanal—will face each other for the position of party chief during the general convention. Both of the leaders also led the CPN-UML in the past.Khanal on Monday emphasised the need of electing the party leadership through a consensus.While addressing the event to launch ‘Mahila Sankalpa-2’, which is the mouthpiece of the party’s women’s wing, All Nepal Women’s Association, Khanal stressed the need for a consensual election of the leaders. However, a certain criteria of leadership should be followed, Khanal said.“To strengthen the leadership within the party, we must select the leaders of the party through a consensus,” Khanal said during the programme. “Since our party was formed on the basis of an ideological ground, political direction, and certain policies and principles, we all should strive to maintain these values while selecting the leadership as well.”A party insider claimed that Khanal staked his claim for the top position as his political line was adopted in the political document to be presented in the general convention. Party general secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal prepared the political document to be presented in the general convention of the party. While in the UML, party chair Nepal embraced Madan Bhandari’s People’s Multi-party Democracy unconditionally for many years while Khanal and Bhusal viewed it critically. According to party leaders, Khanal and Bhusal have succeeded in including their ideas in the Unified Socialist’s official line.“In politics, the leaders whose policies prevail as the party’s official line should get the opportunity to lead the party,” a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Though the political document of the party is guided by the thoughts of general secretary Bhusal, Khanal also owns it, so he is claiming the leadership.”This does not mean that party chair Nepal has not owned the political document passed by the party's central committee, but the document is closer to the political line advocated by Bhusal and Khanal for a long time, said a party insider.Party chair Nepal, while addressing the same programme on Monday, also said that there are no differences among the leaders in terms of the party’s ideological line. “The preparation of the political, organisational and other documents to be presented in the upcoming congress is a collective effort of party leaders and cadres,” Nepal said.In addition to Nepal and Khanal, the party's general secretary Bhusal is also considering contesting for the party chair in the upcoming congress, though he has not publicly announced it yet.“Matters related to the aspiration of the leaders for the post of office bearers will be clear only after the selection of convention representatives,” Jeevan Ram Shrestha, the secretary of the party, told the Post. “Before the selection of the representatives, all things that have come from the media are mere speculation.”The party has decided to select general convention representatives from around the country on Wednesday. Shrestha said that the selection of representatives will make things clearer about the aspirants’ claims.Khanal has already opened his contact office at Baneshwar with a plan to manage his team’s activities during the general convention.Though Khanal has opened his contact office, he may or may not contest for the vital post, says another leader of the party who does not want to disclose his identity. The leader said that it might be under his publicity strategy. “If the political scenario is not in his favour, Khanal might back Bhusal for the leadership of the party to challenge Nepal,” the leader claimed. “On the other hand, Nepal, the present chair of the party, might also back Bhusal if he senses a tough challenge from Khanal.”Bhusal has remained tightlipped about his candidacy in view of the situation, a leader close to Bhusal said. “If the two top leaders decide to face each other, Bhusal might settle with his current position of general secretary.”The party’s deputy general secretaries, Jagan Nath Khatiwada and Parkash Jwala, have already announced their bid for the post of general secretary.The party will most likely select the leadership through consensus, says another leader. Meanwhile, there are voices in favour of continuing present chair Nepal in the position saying that he has put utmost efforts to establish the party after the split and sustain it amid a challenging situation. But there are also leaders who want Khanal’s leadership.“One of the two leaders will possibly lead the party,” Unified Socialist leader Som Prasad Pandey, who is close to Nepal, told the Post. “Though Bhusal’s name is also in the discussion for the post of chair, he is most likely to continue as the general secretary.”Meanwhile, former CPN-UML vice-chair Bhim Rawal, who has remained inactive in the UML after the party's convention held in November 2021 in Chitwan, is reportedly considering joining the Unified Socialist from the upcoming congress. In 2021, Rawal challenged Oli for the position of party chair despite Oli’s request not to do so. Since then, Rawal has been given no role in the UML.“Our party is in talks with Bhim Rawal to bring him to the party. We have already held two rounds of negotiation with him,” Shrestha, the secretary, told the Post. “If everything goes as planned, Rawal will join our party with a respectable position.”The Post’s attempts to contact Rawal to confirm Shrestha’s claim were unsuccessful. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nDays after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Road—something the UML opposes.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said. \nDead bodies of a man and a woman were found on a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, located on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.According to the Kathmandu Valley Police Office, the bodies were spotted approximately 200 metres down the hill from the Kathmandu-Dakshinkali road.Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Raj Mainali said that the preliminary investigation suggests they died in an accident, as a crashed motorcycle was found near the bodies.Mainali said a disaster management team of Nepal Police is working to retrieve the bodies from the hill. He said locals informed the police after spotting the bodies on Wednesday evening.The police said the deceased woman is a 32-year-old resident of Changunarayan Municipality-5, while the man is yet to be identified. \nIn Nepal, the festivals measure the economy. Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to trim purchases.After a year, the situation seems unimproved.“We are not in the mood to place orders for goods for upcoming festivities,” said Ram Hari Karki, president of Nepal Trans Himalayan Border Commerce Association. “There is no demand at all. It looks like a deep economic slowdown.”Usually, traders place orders for foreign goods, particularly apparel, three months before the start of Nepal’s key festival season. Even though traders bring some amount of goods, it may be costlier. Due to the appreciation of the US dollar and increased customs duties, the prices of goods and commodities may rise, causing difficulties for many ordinary Nepalis.“Goods are becoming costlier day by day. That is why traders are cautious this year about placing orders,” said Karki. “The demand for festivities has not returned to the pre-pandemic level.”There are no statistics about consumption during the Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, but analysts say it grows manifold compared to the normal time. Kumar Karki, president of the Nepal National Traders’ Federation, said due to subdued demand, they may see a business decline by 15–20 percent. In comparison, prices may rise by 20 percent in the upcoming festivals.Even during the summer, traders say the market has slowed down.“Despite the rising heat, the demand for summer garments and shoes has not picked up,” said a trader in New Road, the country’s central shopping hub. “The footfall of shoppers has declined compared to last year’s season, reflecting the decline in people’s incomes.”“Nowadays, only a handful of traders are planning their trip to China to order goods. We don’t see demand recovering from last year’s drop,” said Kumar Karki.Some traders say there is a shift in the trade.In the past years, China fulfilled 80 percent of Nepal’s need for readymade garments.However, according to three top traders who spoke to the Post, the market seems flooded with Indian goods, which are relatively cheaper.Currently, traders said, an average of 15–20 loaded trucks are entering from Kerung and Tatopani customs points to the north, carrying garments, shoes and slippers, raincoats, and umbrellas, among other items. Before the Covid pandemic, 50–60 loaded trucks used to enter Nepal from the Chinese border at this time of the year.Cost is the key factor in subdued demand.On Friday, the Nepali rupee plunged to an all-time low of Rs134.15 against the dollar. A strong US dollar has advantages and disadvantages. It has negative impacts on an import-based economy like Nepal.“While importing goods, we must pay 30 to 40 percent as customs duty. The high customs duty has made imported goods expensive,” said Kumar Karki. The government needed to ease customs through the coming fiscal year's budget and further tighten it, he said. Importing goods through legal channels is becoming more difficult day by day, especially at the customs, and this has encouraged the illegal import of goods. This has resulted in an import decline.According to the central bank's macroeconomic report, the inflation rate on non-food and services remained at 2.96 percent in mid-May this year, compared to 8.89 percent a year ago. The year-on-year price index of clothes and footwear remained at 3.46 percent.Market analysts, however, say that data presents different facts than the actual market scenario. Economists say that youth are the significant spenders, and demand has declined in sectors like education and restaurants, including consumption of goods and services, as many youths have migrated abroad to study and work.Economist Nara Bahadur Thapa said that import-related activities used to increase by 30 percent with the start of a new fiscal year compared to other months before Covid. However, the number of traders importing goods by opening Letters of Credit (LC) has declined in recent years.“From July to October, imports used to spike and cross Rs200 billion per month, but now, even with the rise in foreign exchange rate, it hardly crosses Rs150 billion. This shows that the demand has declined as a result of economic slowdown,” Thapa said.Thapa said that as people's purchasing power has declined, the demand for different goods in major festival times has declined. The salaries of government and private sector employees have not increased in the past few years. “People are not going to spend unless they have money in their hands.”According to the Department of Customs, Nepal’s imports declined by 1.84 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended in mid-June, compared to the same period last fiscal year.The country’s imports slipped 16.08 percent to Rs1.61 trillion in the last fiscal year. \n\nThe Nepali rupee recorded an all-time low, with Nepal’s central bank fixing the exchange rate at Rs134.15 per US dollar for Friday.The Nepali currency was weakened by 31 paisa against the dollar in a single day. The rupee’s fall is attributed to a steady depreciation of the Indian rupee, to which it is pegged.Experts say Nepal, an import-driven economy, may see a sharp rise in inflation due to the dollar's strength, as almost all goods and services are quoted in dollar terms.Commodities like edible oil, petroleum fuel, and foods are priced in dollars globally, so a stronger dollar adds to the cost of Nepali consumers. As food expenditures make up large shares of consumption, the constant weakening of the local currency makes the goods dearer in Nepal.Traders say apparel prices may rise in the upcoming festival season as they have started to place orders. Kumar Karki, president of the Nepal National Traders’ Federation, said the rising dollar may make goods, particularly apparel and electronics, more expensive during the Dashain and Tihar festivals. According to estimates, sales of food and non-food items surge manifold during the festival period.Traders have already started visiting China to place orders, especially for goods to be imported for festival sales in October, said Karki. Most festival goods, such as readymade clothes, shoes, bags, and accessories, are imported from China.According to media reports, the dollar strengthened as the Swiss National Bank delivered an interest-rate cut, underscoring the divergence in monetary policies among global central banks as the US Federal Reserve delayed easing policy. In India, the central bank has allowed the rupee to weaken, though it intervenes to curb wild swings. Nepali currency automatically strengthens when the Indian currency is strong and weakens when the Indian currency weakens. Nepal has been following a pegged exchange rate system with the Indian rupee.Nepal adopts a different kind of exchange rate system for other convertible currencies.In line with the economic liberalisation policy introduced in the mid-1980s, Nepal introduced current account convertibility in 1993, effectively pegging the Nepali rupee to the Indian rupee at the rate of 1.60, the same rate as in 1960 when the two currencies were first pegged. Since 1993, the exchange rate of the Nepali rupee with other convertible currencies has been market-determined in line with the exchange rate of the Indian rupee with convertible currencies.A strong US dollar has both advantages and disadvantages for a country like Nepal. It benefits some but negatively impacts others.According to Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of Nepal Rastra Bank, the depreciation of the domestic currency could exert pressure on the balance of payments as Nepal would have to spend more money to buy foreign goods.According to him, the depreciation of the domestic currency is likely to worsen inflation, as the country is highly dependent on imported goods and has low domestic output.“The currency’s devaluation makes exports cheaper, measured in foreign currency, and imports become more expensive, measured in the home currency.”The price effect may lead the goods and services sector of Nepal to weaken, said Karki. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, in the first ten months of the current fiscal year, merchandise exports decreased by 3.6 percent to Rs126.17 billion.However, merchandise imports amounted to a staggering Rs1.30 trillion in the review period.The most significant impact will be on purchasing petroleum products, Nepal’s biggest import, on which the country is fully dependent. It will also impact the cost of chemical fertiliser.On the other hand, the appreciation of the US dollar can benefit remittance earners. Remittance inflows increased 19.2 percent to Rs1.19 trillion in the review period. Another advantage will be on the foreign exchange reserve, according to experts.Those countries with ample reserves may sell foreign exchange to bolster their currencies. Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased to a record $14.54 billion in mid-May.Similarly, a soaring US dollar means tourists can buy more of the Nepali currency. Visitors from abroad will find the prices of goods and services in Nepal cheaper with a stronger dollar.Travel income, the money spent by foreigners, increased 35 percent to Rs69.41 billion in the first ten months of the current fiscal year.The strong dollar increases the burden of debt repayment in local currency terms.Thus, as the dollar becomes stronger relative to other currencies, these repayments become more expensive in terms of the domestic currency.The price of gold also increases in the local market when the dollar rises.The Nepali currency vis-à-vis the US dollar depreciated 1.61 percent in mid-May 2024 from mid-July 2023, while it had depreciated 2.79 percent in the same period of the previous year. \nThanks to a favourable climate, farmer Bhagwati Kandel rejoices at this season’s bumper potato harvest. His profits have also grown, with the vegetable fetching better prices this year.Potatoes are a superfood rich in essential vitamins and minerals and high in calories. As green vegetables have become prohibitively expensive for some, potatoes fill the vacuum and grow in demand. Potato farmers in Rainas Municipality generally sell their produce at nearby markets. This year, however, the situation is quite different. Vegetable traders are arriving at the farmers' doors to buy potatoes, a versatile food.Kandel of Rainas Municipality Ward 4 produced 16 tonnes of potatoes on her 10 ropanies.She sold 8 tonnes at Rs23 per kg from the field. The government also provided Rs2 per kg to potato farmers as an incentive to grow the vegetable.Kandel was encouraged to cultivate potatoes after the Agriculture Knowledge Centre provided seeds at a 75 percent subsidy and trained farmers on responsive pest management technology.The result was a bumper harvest. She earned Rs200,000, including the government subsidy.Shiva Adhikari of Sundarbazaar Municipality Ward 10 produced 4 tonnes of potatoes. He sold 3 tonnes and earned around Rs86,000.This season, Adhikari and 40 other farmers associated with the Bhagyodaya Farmers Group produced 50 tonnes of potatoes. Nearly half the output sold from their fields for a total of Rs555,450. The remaining potatoes were sold for the market price, ranging from Rs30 to Rs40 per kg. Kandel said that the farmers got better prices by selling the potatoes in retail.In the hills and mountains, planting starts in November, and harvesting is done usually in June. The potatoes cultivated in upper areas from January to February are harvested in June.Sudip Khatiwada, senior plant development officer at the Agriculture Knowledge Center, said that farmers in three municipalities—Rainas, Sundarbazaar, and Madhyanepal—produced 474 tonnes of potatoes on 509 ropanies this year. They sold 247 tonnes and earned Rs5.72 million. Potatoes continue to be crucial to global food security as a key diet to fight hunger and poverty.Khatiwada said that the local government is encouraging farmers to produce more potatoes due to their market value and growing demand.“Farmers sell their crops to wholesalers. They get even more value if they sell to retailers.”In retail, potatoes fetch up to Rs40 per kg. “In Lamjung, farmers in eight different groups earned more than Rs10 million this season,” Khatiwada said. According to the centre, 59 farmers of Rainash Municipality-4 produced 152 tonnes of potatoes. Of these, 88 tonnes were sold from the farm for Rs2.38 million. The farmers also received Rs177,300 in subsidies from the Agriculture Knowledge Centre.According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development statistics, potato is grown in Nepal on 198,256 hectares, with an annual yield of 3.41 million tonnes. In Lamjung, potato is produced on 1,975 hectares with an annual output of 38,500 tonnes.Ishwor Gurung, another potato farmer, said that in Lamjung, farmers in the lower altitudes usually grow winter potatoes. Potatoes are grown in the rainy season in the upper reaches, where temperatures are low. “We have harvested potatoes and are selling them currently,” Gurung said. Potatoes are one of the world's most important food crops. Experts say potato production must be adapted to climate change to avoid reductions in crop yield. Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are predicted to benefit potato plants and crop yields. The major benefit of this phenomenon for potatoes is an increase in their photosynthetic rates, which can increase their growth rates.In Lamjung, according to Khatiwada, the production is sometimes different.“The production cost is high. Most of the time, farmers have to bear losses if the output declines due to pests,” said Khatiwada. “We have assisted farmers by providing seed and technical know-how.” “We are also making arrangements for farmers to sign advance contracts with buyers,” he said. Under this initiative, buyers make a purchase agreement with farmers before potato planting.Khatiwada said this ensures farmers the market for their crop. \nA 45-year-old woman from Dhapasi, Kathmandu was diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes some six months ago. Doctors at the National Cardiac Center, who attended to the patient prescribed medicines and advised her to change her lifestyle and eating habits to control the ailments.“The patient, who was worried about her health conditions, took the doctors’ advice seriously and joined a yoga class in the morning, made a drastic change in her eating habits, and engaged in physical activities,” said Dr Om Murti Anil, a senior cardiologist. “Her blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels are now under control, and she has also reduced her weight. Now, she doesn't need the high dose of medicines like in the past. ”This was a common refrain among a few patients, who took doctors' advice seriously, changed their lifestyles and eating habits, joined yoga classes, and increased physical activity, which helped them control high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.Public health experts say changing eating habits, lessening body weight, and starting physical activities, including yoga and physical exercises, help control non-communicable diseases, which have emerged as a major public health problem in Nepal.Studies show that non-communicable diseases have emerged as a serious public health issue in Nepal, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that they accounted for 71 percent of the deaths in the country. The study primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption—and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.“For many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,” said Anil. “To reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.”Many patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity. Doctors warn that non-communicable diseases—hypertension, heart disease, stroke and diabetes, among others—could lead to a public health crisis if not addressed immediately. They blame a sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of processed foods as chief culprits for the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and obesity.They warn that people from all walks of life have been affected by the repercussions of changing lifestyles and food habits. Entire family members suffer if any member, particularly the breadwinner, faces serious health problems.Experts say continuous awareness campaigns about the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, and the start of yoga classes in community centres, schools, and open-air gyms could help lessen the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. “Physical exercises not only help in managing the disease conditions but also lessen the risk of developing non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Munkarna Thapa, information officer at the Department of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. “Along with physical fitness, they contribute to the mental well-being of people.”Meanwhile, department officials said that they have allocated a budget to promote open-air fitness centres, yoga classes, and alternatives, keeping in mind the growing burden of non-communicable diseases in society.Open-air gyms have been set up in public places, and the public can use them free of charge. Apart from setting up outdoor gyms, imparting training to communities and school students and promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce the major risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases, Thapa said.The department, which has already set up open-air fitness centres at the headquarters of all seven provinces, plans to set up 10 more such centres in the upcoming fiscal year. Several local units also have set up such facilities in their areas. \nIn a bid to address the problem of malnutrition in children under five, the Ministry of Health and Population has started imparting training to nurses and paramedics serving in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Officials hope that a week-long training programme will help lessen the existing problems of malnutrition in those provinces.“Imparting training to combat malnutrition in small children is our nationwide programme, which we have started from Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Along with imparting training to health workers, we will also launch an awareness drive to improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.”Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.The report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, but progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.The report shows that exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining, from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent last year. Health officials said that studies show that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies.According to the report, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing mothers’ education, from 12 percent among those whose mothers have no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile at 46 percent and lowest in the lowest quintile at 11 percent.Likewise, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province at 11 percent, in Madhesh Province at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province at 43 percent.Exclusive breastfeeding is the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and the lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.“We have allocated the nutrition budget to launch a nationwide awareness drive about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the upcoming fiscal year,” said Thapa. “We have also designated a nutrition focal person at every local unit who is tasked to discourage practices of promoting replacement feeding.”The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared with 12 percent of those born at home. Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children, according to the World Health Organisation.Health ministry officials hoped that training for nurses and paramedics would help lessen bottle-feeding practices in health facilities.Doctors say breastfeeding should continue for the first two years or beyond, as breast milk lowers children’s risk of illness, promotes their recovery during illness, and remains an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nDiarrhoeal cases have declined threefold in Nepal, multiple reports, including a recent one by the Nepal Statistics Office, show. The Nepal Demographic Health Survey-2022 and a report of the Ministry of Health and Population suggest the same.Improvements in water and sanitation conditions, personal hygiene and awareness levels are credited with the decline in infection from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoeal infections.“A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices,” reads a report by the Nepal Statistics Office.Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health concern usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. It is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young children.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, also showed that 10 percent of children under 5 have diarrhoea. The prevalence of diarrhoea is highest among children aged 6-11 months at 18 percent, followed by 13 percent each among those aged 12–23 months and less than six months.Public health experts say the decline in open defecation, the general public’s behavioural change towards hygienic practice, and an increase in literacy and education levels could have also contributed to a decline in diarrhoeal infections.“Decline in open defecation, rise in education and awareness levels, behavioural changes, improvement in water and sanitation conditions play an important role in cutting the burden of diarrhoeal infections,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “We can see a lot of changes in these things, but at the same time, we should not forget that sources of drinking water are still problematic in many places, including in the capital city.”According to the NDHS report, advice or treatment was sought for 57 percent of children who had diarrhoea in the two weeks preceding the survey, down from 64 percent in 2016.The report also shows that the percentage of diarrhoeal infection is lower among those with an unimproved source of drinking water at 4 percent than among those with an improved source at 11 percent.Experts say that so-called improved sources of drinking water are still not safe to drink.“E.coli and coliform-like hazardous microbes get detected in most water resources, including in the samples of bottled water,” Pun said. “We must be more cautious while drinking water, as the monsoon season has just started and most water sources get contaminated with floodwaters.”Earlier in March, drinking water samples collected from public taps and community schools in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur were found to be contaminated with faecal coliform.Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. Its presence means that the drinking water being used by locals of Godawari is contaminated with sewage.The Ministry of Health and Population’s annual report for the fiscal year 2022-23 also shows a three-fold decline in diarrhoeal infections. According to the report, the national incidence rate of diarrhoea was 115 per 1,000 under-five children in 2022-23 compared to 365 in the fiscal year 2021-22.The ministry’s report showed four under-five deaths from diarrhoeal infection in the fiscal year 2022-23 compared to 34 deaths in 2021-22.Of the four deaths that occurred in the fiscal year 2022-23, one each was recorded in Bagmati, Madhesh, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with no reported diarrhoeal death in Lumbini, Koshi, and Gandaki provinces.Contrary to the NDHS, the health ministry’s report shows that Karnali Province had the highest incidence of diarrhoea—216, followed by Lumbini Province’s 161. The lowest incidence was reported in Bagmati Province at 78.According to the World Health Organisation, diarrhoea is the second leading cause of mortality in children under five. The disease has also been linked with growth and cognitive shortfalls in children, especially in marginalised communities.Doctors say the only ways to prevent people from dying of water-borne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nRussian guided bombs shattered an apartment building in Ukraine’s second-largest city on Saturday, killing three people, injuring 52 and prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to call for more help to deal with the growing threat of such weapons.Pictures posted online showed parts of the five-storey apartment building in ruins, with windows smashed, balconies wrecked and rubble strewn about a crater on the ground.Prosecutors in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region put the casualty toll at three dead and 52 injured in the mid-afternoon attack, including three injured children. Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said four of those hurt were in serious condition.“This Russian terror through guided bombs must be stopped and can be stopped,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.“We need strong decisions from our partners to enable us to stop the Russian terrorists and Russian military aviation right where they are.”Later, in his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said Russian forces had used more than 2,400 guided bombs on Ukrainian targets in June alone, with about 700 aimed at Kharkiv.He said after US Congress gave delayed approval of a big aid package in April, Ukraine's replenished arms supplies had reduced the devastation and frequency of missile attacks and the same had to be done now to fend off these bombs.“The significant reduction in Russian missile terror against Kharkiv and the region proves it is entirely possible to secure our cities and communities from Russian bombs,” he said.Ukraine, he said, needed promised military aid packages “without delay so that the agreements we reached with (US) President Biden can be realised.”Ukraine and the US signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement this month aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defense against Russia and getting Ukraine closer to NATO membership.Russia has relied increasingly on relatively inexpensive guided bombs, dropped from a distance and involving fewer risks for its forces.Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has advanced slowly through Donetsk region in the east, capturing a string of villages since seizing the key industrial town of Avdiivka more than three months ago.It launched a cross-border incursion north of Kharkiv last month, though Zelenskiy says the situation there has stabilised.In the latest bomb attack, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said there had been four strikes on Kharkiv.Regional governor Syniehubov said rescue work was proceeding at the building, which housed a store on the ground floor.Kharkiv Police Chief Serhiy Bolvinov told public broadcaster Suspilne that three floors had collapsed, but he believed no one was trapped under the rubble.Kharkiv lies about 30 km (20 miles) from the border with Russia. The city of 1.3 million people has frequently been targeted in Russian attacks during nearly 28 months of war.Moscow denies deliberately targeting civilians but thousands have been killed and injured in the war. \nA shooter opened fire at an Arkansas supermarket on Friday, killing three civilians and wounding 10 other people, including two police officers, Arkansas State Police said.The suspect was also wounded in a shootout with police, Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters.The shooting occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery in Fordyce, a town of 3,200 people about 70 miles (112 km) south of Little Rock.“Unfortunately, we can confirm that 11 innocent civilians were shot, and three of those are deceased. Two law enforcement officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire. The suspect was also shot and taken into custody,” Hagar said. He did not explain the circumstances of the shooting or take questions.The wounded police officers and the suspect were expected to survive, he said.Civilian injuries ranged from non-life-threatening to extremely critical, he said.Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on social media platform X that she was briefed on the incident.“I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident,” she said. \nSummaryIsraeli strikes kill at least 45 Palestinians in GazaForces pound southern city of RafahIsrael says forces carrying out ‘precise, intelligence-based’ actionsIsraeli military finds militants’ tunnels in Rafah, it saysIsraeli forces pounded Rafah in southern Gaza on Friday, as well as other areas across the enclave, killing at least 45 Palestinians as troops engaged in close-quarter combat with Hamas militants, residents and Israel’s military said.Residents said the Israelis appeared to be trying to complete their capture of Rafah, which borders Egypt and has been the focus of an Israeli assault since early May.Tanks were forcing their way into the western and northern parts of the city, having already captured the east, south and centre.Firing from planes, tanks and ships off the coast caused more people to flee the city, which a few months ago was sheltering more than a million displaced people, most of whom have now relocated again.The Gaza health ministry said at least 25 Palestinians had been killed in Mawasi in western Rafah and 50 wounded. Palestinians said a tank shell hit a tent housing displaced families.“Two tanks climbed a hilltop overseeing Mawasi and they sent balls of fire that hit the tents of the poor people displaced in the area,” one resident told Reuters over a chat app.The Israeli military said that the incident was under review. “An initial inquiry conducted suggests that there is no indication that a strike was carried out by the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi,” it said.Earlier, the military said its forces were conducting “precise, intelligence-based” actions in the Rafah area, where troops were involved in close-quarter combat and had located tunnels used by militants.Over the past week, the military said, troops targeted a university that served as a Hamas headquarters from which militants fired on soldiers and found weapons and barrel bombs. It did not name the university.In the central Gaza area of Nusseirat, the military said soldiers killed dozens of militants over the past week and found a weapons depot containing mortar bombs and military equipment belonging to Hamas.Some residents said the Israeli onslaught on Rafah had intensified in the previous two days and that the sounds of explosions and gunfire had hardly stopped.“Last night was one of the worst nights in western Rafah: Drones, planes, tanks, and naval boats bombarded the area. We feel the occupation is trying to complete the control of the city,” said Hatem, 45, reached by text message.“They are taking heavy strikes from the resistance fighters, which may be slowing them down.”STRIKES ON KHAN YOUNIS AND GAZA CITYMore than eight months into the war in Gaza, Israel’s advance is now focused on the two last areas its forces had yet to seize: Rafah on Gaza’s southern edge and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre.“The entire city of Rafah is an area of Israeli military operations,” Ahmed Al-Sofi, the mayor of Rafah, said in a statement carried by Hamas media on Friday.“The city is living through a humanitarian catastrophe and people are dying inside their tents because of Israeli bombardment.”Sofi said no medical facility was functioning in the city, and that remaining residents and displaced families lacked the minimum daily needs of food and water.Palestinian and UN figures show that fewer than 100,000 people may have remained in the far western side of the city, which had been sheltering more than half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people before the Israeli assault began in early May.In nearby Khan Younis, an Israeli air strike on Friday killed three people, including a father and son, medics said.In parallel, Israeli forces continued a new push back into some Gaza City suburbs in the north of the enclave, where they fought with Hamas-led militants.On Friday, an Israeli air strike on a Gaza City municipal facility killed five people, including four municipal workers, the territory’s Civil Emergency Service said. Rescue teams were searching the rubble for more missing victims.In the nearby Beach camp, an Israeli air strike on a house killed at least seven people, medics said.Palestinian health officials said at least 45 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Friday.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its Gaza office was damaged when heavy-calibre projectiles landed nearby, in an area where hundreds of displaced Palestinians are living in tents.“This grave security incident is one of several in recent days; previously stray bullets have reached ICRC structures,” the organization said in a post on X on Friday.“We decry these incidents that put the lives of humanitarians and civilians at risk.”Israel’s ground and air campaign was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute.The United Nations said on Friday it is Israel’s responsibility - as the occupying power in the Gaza Strip - to restore public order and safety in the Palestinian territory so humanitarian aid can be delivered, amid warnings of imminent famine. \nThe death toll from days of torrential rain in one of the worst-hit areas in southern China jumped to 38 from nine on Friday, Chinese state television CCTV reported.Downpours this week in Meizhou city in Guangdong province led to flash floods and mudslides that destroyed thousands of low-rise houses, damaged roads and crops, and disrupted communications and power supplies.Two people remain missing in Meizhou’s Pingyuan county, CCTV said.Southern China has been battered by an unusual amount of rains in recent days following an earlier-than-normal start to the annual flooding season.Accumulated precipitation in Pingyuan has reached 1,221.6 millimetres (4 ft) since April 4, more than double the normal amount in the same period of previous years, CCTV said.Deaths during China’s annual summer floods have fallen sharply from the thousands each year in the 1990s, as authorities beefed up flood control measures such as dams.Yet extreme weather in recent years, including record-breaking rainfall, has made China vulnerable to intense flooding and disasters such as sudden mudslides, often in its mountainous but populated areas.The task of controlling floods in China is becoming increasingly arduous, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, calling for all-out efforts to safeguard lives and property as powerful storms pounded China’s southern provinces.China’s National meteorological Center said on Friday a typhoon could form over the weekend and affect coastal areas in the country’s south.Natural disasters, including floods, droughts, an earthquake and freezing weather in China caused direct economic losses of 23.76 billion yuan ($3.27 billion) in the first quarter. \nThe death toll from the latest case of tainted liquor in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu has climbed to 47, with over 100 people still in hospital, a government official said on Friday.Since Wednesday more than 150 people, suffering from vomiting, stomach aches and diarrhoea, have needed treatment after drinking methanol-mixed liquor made in the Kallakurichi district, about 250 km (150 miles) from the state capital Chennai.On Friday morning, 118 people were still being treated in hospitals in the district and nearby areas, the government official said.On Thursday, a government spokesperson said at least 36 people had died.Police arrested four people over illicit liquor sales and seized 200 litres of the alcoholic drink, the state government said on Thursday, adding that it had taken disciplinary action against 10 officials for failure to prevent it.Deaths from illegally produced alcohol, known locally as “hooch” or “country liquor”, are a regular occurrence in India, where many cannot afford branded spirits, even as the public and activists call for a crackdown on the sellers.The Tamil Nadu government said it was taking steps to identify people involved in the production of methanol - a toxic chemical normally used for industrial purposes.Videos from ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake, and local media showed state ministers and opposition leaders making a beeline to the district to meet the victims.There was mass cremation of the deceased and families carried out last rites only a few metres (yards) apart, videos showed, reminiscent of images from India during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.More than a dozen people died last year in a similar incident in a nearby district of Tamil Nadu. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK, a hospital patient who spent over Rs50,000 on medical bills, highlights the widespread disregard for Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 by private hospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal, denying free treatment to the underprivileged despite government mandates\nDespite winning a third term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party lost its parliamentary majority, raising concerns about his future governance and the ongoing prosecution of dissenting voices, including prominent writer Arundhati Roy, under anti-terrorism legislation.\nIn yet another instance of the Nepali society failing to provide a safe space to women, a 16-year girl was raped in Panchadewal Binayak Municipality in Achham on Monday. The victim was staying in a chhau goth, or menstrual shed, at her maternal uncle’s home when she was violated by her distant relative. After years of awareness campaigns and the breaking of chhau sheds by central and local governments as well as non-governmental agencies, the victimisation of women remains a daily occurrence in several parts of Nepal, especially Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. The chhaupadi system was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2005; in 2017, it was made punishable by up to three months in jail or a fine of Rs3,000 or both. But the inhumane practice remains deeply rooted in parts of Nepali society. While reports of extreme cases come from the hinterlands, menstrual taboo rules the roost even in the sophisticated drawing rooms and kitchens of urban centres. Impurity runs in the psyche of the average Nepali; menstrual blood simply oils the juggernaut of superstition, patriarchy and misogyny that is Nepali society.As disturbing as the news of the rape is the report that the victim’s relatives tried to conceal the incident. After all, this is a society whose so-called honour lies in the private parts of a woman. If it cannot save the woman from predators, it must hide the fact that it could not save the woman. From celebrating and defending rape-accused celebrities to punishing victims for speaking up, this society fails women each day. Just consider how unsafe this place is for women who have to suffer the indignity of chhau in this day and age. Cold, rain, wild animals, serpents or asphyxiation do not even come close to the danger they face from men. The tragic irony is that the woman who becomes “impure” or “untouchable” inside the home remains an object of desire inside the chhau shed. Consider how many cases of sexual assaults might have been brushed under the carpet in the name of family honour. Every night a woman has to spend in a chhau shed should count as the death of the conscience of Nepali society.Gauri Kumari Bayak and Amba Bohara and her two children were killed in 2018; Parbati Bogati and Parbati Budha were killed in 2019 in menstrual huts; and the list goes on, the tragedies returning each year. How many women must be raped and murdered before the society goes beyond the “shame” and “honour” dichotomy and considers women equal humans? How many seminars, constitutions and movements does it take for the state to be able to create a safe space for women? The society and the state must answer. Until it can guarantee safety and dignity to the women, the Nepali state might want to keep the national flag half-mast. After all, one-half of the flag belongs to the women, who make up half of the country's population.  \nNepal's bittersweet T20 World Cup performance showcased their cricketing prowess despite no wins, highlighted by a near-miss against South Africa, while also revealing areas for improvement and the need for infrastructure investment.\nAmidst global efforts towards an electric future, Nepal faces challenges in setting EV policies, with a recent tax hike hindering its commitment to EV-based mobility and discouraging the use of EVs despite their potential benefits in reducing emissions, fostering clean air, and promoting hydropower utilization.\nRegistration of corruption cases against elected representatives and officials at local units across the country has become common. The situation is so bad that several local units have even been unable to do their regular work as officials who make key decisions have been suspended after facing corruption charges. For instance, works at Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur, Bagmati Municipality of Sarlahi and Jaleswar Municipality of Mahottari have been hampered as both mayors and deputy mayors of the municipalities have been suspended after they were chargesheeted in corruption cases. The local units have been paralyzed as they haven’t been able to settle who will make decisions as the acting chief; existing laws didn’t envision both top officials being sued at the same time. The Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration is now consulting the Office of the Attorney General on removing legal complications in this regard.Not only elected representatives, key bureaucrats are as engaged in irregularities. Corruption cases have been filed against chief administrative officers of scores of municipalities in the past one year. Some of them have been convicted while cases against many others are sub-judice. Annual reports of the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) paint an alarming picture of irregularities in local administrations. For instance, according to the annual report-2022/23 of the CIAA, of the total 28,067 cases filed by the anti-graft body in the one-year period, 13,142 cases were against officials of local units. Likewise, 11,632 cases were against the officials at the federal agencies and 3,293 against provincial officials. Hence, over 46.8 percent of total corruption cases the CIAA registered in the period are against the irregularities committed by local representatives and officials.The new constitution greatly empowered the local units through the devolution of many erstwhile centralised powers. The constitution is considered to be favouring local authorities even more than the provinces when it comes to rights and responsibilities. After the full-fledged implementation of the three-tier federal system since 2017, all the 753 local units have been exercising executive, legislative and judicial rights in running local administration and formulating rules for themselves. The constitution empowered them significantly but not much was done to enhance their capacity for delivery. Nearly eight years of federal experience shows the local units have failed to maintain good governance and fiscal transparency. Local representatives blame lack of efficient employees and dearth of resources for their substandard performance. Traditionally, civil servants in Nepal have always preferred to stay in urban centres. Also, the federal government has failed to provide sufficient manpower, efficient technical hands and enough resources to improve efficiency in administration outside the Valley. The nature and magnitude of corruption cases and irregularities seen in recent years suggest urgent steps are needed to make the local governments more accountable, transparent and efficient. What we see right now is the representatives and the provincial and local levels repeating many of the corrupt practices of the federal-level representatives. It is hard to make the local representatives responsible when they see that their party bosses at the centre are even more unaccountable and unreliable.  \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nLawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nAmnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  \nThe weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country on Sunday.For those in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces, be prepared for light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning.
