Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepalese manufacturers and exporters face challenges trading with India due to restrictive measures and the Indian government's silence on BIS certification, halting exports of sanitary pads, diapers, shoes, cement, plywood, and other goods.\nNepal's Prime Minister Oli's upcoming China visit will focus on implementing past agreements, with Nepal seeking to convert a Pokhara Airport loan to a grant and sign a Belt and Road Initiative implementation plan.\nParliamentary committees remain inactive, despite Speaker's plea and commitments from major parties, leaving the winter session of federal parliament potentially without adequate business.\nNepal's Ministry of Health hires 36 nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding, which has declined from 70% in 2011 to 56% in 2021, with bottle-feeding more prevalent in urban areas, higher maternal education, and higher wealth quintiles.\nNepal announces 18-man squad for ACC U-19 Asia Cup, captained by Dhami, set to compete in group B against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan from November 29 to December 8.\nEighteen Nepalis trafficked through multiple countries to reach Bulgaria were arrested three months ago for entering without valid documents. The Nepali Embassy in Germany, which provides consular support to Nepalis in Bulgaria, confirmed that the Nepalis were detained on charges of illegal entry.The Bulgarian authorities are preparing to deport the detainees this week. They are currently held at a deportation centre in the capital city, Sofia. “There are 18 of us here, waiting for travel documents,” one detainee said. “We hope to be repatriated soon.” The detainee added that none of them have passports. “The Bulgarian authorities have contacted the Nepali Embassy to arrange travel documents for our return.”Sagar Prasad Phuyal, the deputy chief of mission at the Nepali Embassy in Germany, confirmed the embassy’s coordination with Bulgarian authorities to expedite the deportation process. “We have issued the necessary travel documents,” Phuyal said. “The Bulgarian government will cover their travel costs to Nepal, and they are expected to be deported by next week.”The detainees reportedly travelled from India to Romania, then Hungary, and finally Bulgaria, with many initially arriving in Romania on work permits. Of late, there are some reports of instances of some Nepalis abandoning their legal work status in Romania and attempting to reach other European countries.“I was planning to go to Poland,” said one detainee. “I had a three-month Bulgarian visa, but it expired, and I was arrested. Returning to Nepal is now the only option left.” \nSome serious newspapers have raised a crucial question recently—why is the Nepali response to the current atrocities of war so scant? This inquisition has an element of sarcasm: Are we not sensitive enough about world events? However, the main concern is about the silence of the Nepalis or the Nepali press on the colossus suffering of men, women and children caused by indiscriminate bombings and shootings that are reported every day. Given that the scale of suffering and physical assaults has surpassed all known limits, this concern is natural. “The scenes may be disturbing” has become the common warning of news anchors, a constant admonition of the apocalypse, as it were. It seems we live in a time when visuals of disaster jostle to take space in our system of understanding the world. Among the horrific events that are common are the wars and killings in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan, to name a few. Besides these, more incidents are happening that assail our sensibilities. The common pattern of suffering and atrocities is uncanny. Lethal bombs fall on peaceful cities and suburbs, hospitals and schools. Never before have such insensitivities showing children crawling out of the rubble, crying in horror and women mourning their dear ones, been reported or recorded as today. I recall one literary event organised by the institution of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) literary writers, held from December 3-6, 2023, in Delhi. The theme of the conference was “Anguish over Senseless Wars.” I want to cite from my article, published in this newspaper under the title of the above-mentioned theme, about the writers’ protest against war: “The anguish felt by the writers about wars, especially the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Gaza wars, truly reflect literary writers’ concern. Non-partisan humanists, creators and advocates of peace and welfare, the writers get hurt more than the others by the colossal loss of lives, including children, in these and other senseless wars. All artists are touched by wars that are truly senseless. There are many instances of writers’ opposition to the wars. But they have paid heavily for such gestures. There is a history of banning books written against wars and other atrocities. In several places today, the voices of writers are drowned; they are even persecuted.” (The Kathmandu Post, December 24, 2023). The general complaint is that Nepali response to world events is not commonly featured in our media, nor does it occupy a space of importance in serious academic discussions. Maybe we must first look at our response to wars and atrocities in history. The Nepali youths, perhaps more than many others in Asia, have encountered and experienced the effects of world events, including wars, with personal involvement, physical loss of lives, and suffering. Researchers have discovered the songs composed by these youths who fought in the First World War as British soldiers. As an example, I would like to mention the research works of Alaka Atreya Chudal, a Vienna University teacher. Several such works record the experience of the Nepali youths who fought in the Second World War. That spectre of history continues to haunt and attract the Nepali youths today. I have no space to mention them here. What it shows is that the Nepali response to world events in history had a subjective and existential character. This subject needs a different treatment. Experiencing the effect of world events differs from looking at the incidents and making objective assessments. But it is natural for us to question today or at any other time about the scanty response to the current horrid events in our political expressions and the media. One Nepali youth, Bipin Joshi, was kidnapped by Hamas in the October 7 attack last year. The complaint is that the killings of civilians in the punitive attacks are not sufficiently reported and that people have not expressed their views on the events. But my impression is that we have responded well to these events. Nepali print and visual media are reporting the events regularly. The other quality of the world events is their diffused and confusing nature. Over the years, the events around the world did not have any recognisable nature. Covid-19 was a crisis that evoked the diverse responses of various world leaders, and the problems became serious after that. World events have had devastating effects on people's minds. In the words of Gordon Brown, Britain's former prime minister, “The world is on fire. At no time since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 has the world looked so dangerous, nor has an end to its 56 conflicts—the highest number since the Second World War—seemed so distant and so difficult to achieve.\" (The Guardian, April 12, 2024). That remoteness and staggering number of events make it difficult for any media or individuals in Nepal to respond to the events. Our response is politically and emotionally oriented, a recognisable pattern in the world today. But the conditions that generate world events go beyond the control of those responsible for them. The rise of certain individuals to power with global effects and the temptation to invade others’ territories and kill innocent people indiscriminately appear to shape the patterns of current events. Nepalis who have their own way of dealing with the world do respond. Their expression is shaped by their political ideologies or sheer humanitarian concerns. And that is happening. There is no space to cite examples here. It is natural for the media to allude to this subject and be surprised at Nepali media’s sparse response to people’s sufferings in all the “senseless wars”. We can question the causes of such a limited response to the terrible suffering of people in the wars. One reason is the emergence of a very boisterous and acrimonious political culture in Nepal, with political groups, media and the public spending most of their time on it. I would not call it solipsism, but this is certainly a subject of concern. Developing a comprehensive vision is the answer.  \nThe American fate has been sealed. Donald Trump has been elected the 47th President of the United States. If his victory in 2016 was more than just a fluke, it is convincing and comprehensive this time. This is what the common Americans want, and the rest of the world will have to live with it, just like the supporters of his Demoractic rival, Kamala Harris, who are still in shock.We can discuss what Trump’s re-election means for the rest of the world and this region, but let us first take a longer detour to understand what is brewing inside the world’s largest democracy.American nightmareIn the first week of March 2024, The New York Times published a report based on their telephone survey of around 980 registered voters, where they interviewed each participant about their perception of the two US presidential candidates. The survey, conducted in collaboration with Siena College in New York, showed that Trump had the support of 44 percent of the prospective voters, compared to 38 percent who favoured then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden. The survey results were significant, considering Trump's exit in 2020 as one of the most disliked presidents in US history, with multiple criminal charges against him. More significantly, only a quarter of the respondents thought the country was on the right track, and around 50 percent believed that the Biden administration’s policies had personally hurt them. A few weeks before the polls, the survey team returned to the seven states, known as the battleground states, to understand the voting behaviour of roughly 7879 likely voters. Close to 90 percent of the participants were certain they would vote, but interestingly, 62 percent were undecided or refused to discuss their voting preference. The question then is, why were television channels and political pundits predicting Harris’s victory when the data and survey polls were far from conclusive? The answer is a bitter pill that analysts and panellists, engaged in an unenviable job of predicting elections, have difficulty swallowing. The world is unfair, and people usually make choices that benefit them personally. From our own electoral experiences, in a developing or developed country, in a highly progressive democracy or a flawed one, we have learned the hard way not to take the voters for granted. Common voters—unlike a party worker, an academic or a self-styled activist, can be individualists who think only about what the candidate has to offer and how their policies affect their lives. They are not always burdened by the higher morals of society, nor are they too concerned about events that don’t directly impact their lives. This is especially true if the voters believe their interests are being put at stake by their representatives in the name of a larger public good. This is at the heart of the majoritarian conservatism that is leading the world into a democratic back-sliding. For millions of people of colour, including Asian Americans, who migrated to the US in the 80s and the 90s, the American dream from Hollywood movies became a reality when the US government adopted a diversity policy to fulfil its skilled manpower needs. There is every reason to believe this policy boosted the US economy and projected the country as the land of democracy and dreams for minorities. But what did it do to the mindset of the majority of white Americans, including the working middle-class population? We do not know, do we? The nationalist rhetoric, often spewing hate against immigrants of different colour and races, did not gain strong support among a large section in a day or a decade. My own experience of writing and talking about the political inclusion of minorities has taught me spending too much time talking in an eco-chamber can blind-sight you from the reality unfolding right before your eyes. The sooner intellectuals and activists in the US understand this, the more they will be invested and interested in understanding the insecurities that have haunted their majority population. After all, the economic and environmental shocks the world has been facing since the last few decades have affected us all, irrespective of race, gender or ethnicity.The global aftershocks If Trump’s re-election has sent shockwaves within the US, its aftershocks will be felt across different continents. His final months of the campaign focused on convincing the Americans that the Biden-Harris administration was bleeding the US economy by fighting proxy wars and that he would get both Putin and Netanyahu to end the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. It will take more than two months for Trump to assume office at the White House and another month for his administration to be in order. Any chances of direct talks with Russia and Israel, if at all, are a few months away. In the Indo-Pacific region, Trump will most likely continue on the course set by the previous administration. Given the global economic crisis that has had far-reaching consequences for both the Chinese and the American economies, Beijing and Washington have agreed to a gradual de-escalation in the Indo-Pacific. Any radical departure from this course will hurt both superpowers and push the global economy into another meltdown. The de-escalation between the nuclear powers will also benefit smaller South Asian states caught in a difficult big-power rivalry. A parallel development in this regard is the US’s relationship with India, which has been strained by the alleged involvement of Indian diplomats in espionage and attempted assassination on US soil. Similar allegations by Canada have resulted in a severe diplomatic fallout with New Delhi. It is unclear how the incoming Trump administration will react to these developments, especially when there is pre-existing discontent over New Delhi’s close ties with the Russians while continuing its security alliance with the US in the Indo-Pacific. If the recent Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) summit in Russia is of any consequence, Washington will need more than just a fleeting interest in the region to fix things with New Delhi. But is Trump ready to ride the high tides in the Indo-Pacific just yet? The president of the US is the world’s most powerful executive, commanding the largest economy and military. So, Trump's re-election as president is one of the most significant political developments of this decade. While Trump’s position concerning the climate crisis and human rights is deeply concerning, the global community will be more interested in his efforts to restore peace in war-ravaged Europe and the Middle East. On the domestic issues, however, we can only say: God bless America! \nFollowing 9/11, the ashes of the World Trade Centre in New York ignited fires in different parts of the world. Even now, 23 years later, those fires are proving difficult to extinguish. The so-called War on Terror (WoT), much like the Cold War, has been an expansive war, which has directly or indirectly affected almost every nation. It would, therefore, be of interest to examine their similarities and differences.The term ‘Cold War’ was first used by George Orwell, the nom de plume of Eric Arthur Blair, in an article in 1945. The war itself commenced with the announcement of the Truman Doctrine in 1947 and concluded with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The WoT started about 10 years later, in 2001. The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in 2021 was celebrated as the end of the WoT. However, post-withdrawal developments proved that the WoT had merely entered a new phase. The US may have physically withdrawn from the theatre, but its strategic interests remained intact. Even today, the great powers and major terrorist groups do not know when the WoT will end.While the Cold War was between two blocs, with other states taking a side, the ongoing WoT was supposed to be between nation-states and violent non-state actors. In reality, some states did provide space, finances, and ideological and diplomatic support to violent non-state actors; otherwise, it would be difficult for the latter to survive.Therefore, though terrorist groups were also active during the Cold War, the post-9/11 era saw a mushroom growth in their numbers. Al Qaeda was established much before the WoT, but it spawned and inspired a number of extremist groups thereafter. The WoT not only impacted the sovereignty of states but also the territorial integrity of a few. Countries like Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and Afghanistan faced instability and were confronted with civil war-like situations.The Cold War was primarily an ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism; the WoT was about combating terrorism based on a struggle against extremist ideologies. The Cold War and WoT both influenced international relations, with alliances shaping geopolitics. The Cold War saw Soviet expansion, with the capitalist bloc trying to contain it. For some analysts, the Cold War was a smokescreen for the US to influence and control events in Western Europe and Japan. On the other hand, the WoT remained largely focused on specific regions, particularly in the Middle East. The Cold War spawned a nuclear race and indirect military engagements, while the WoT saw direct and prolonged military engagements, as seen in Afghanistan and Iraq.To recognise its strategic partners in 1987, the US designated Major Non-Nato Ally (MNNA) status to various countries.MNNAs are not members of Nato but are entitled to certain benefits in military cooperation. Out of the 20 countries with MNNA status, eight received it before 9/11, while 12 countries obtained this status in the post-9/11 era. This highlights how the US grew its military influence around the world following the WoT.The WoT is not restricted to national borders and involves many countries and international coalitions. The WoT often involves state actors combating non-state actors and has therefore influenced security legislation and policies such as the US’s Patriot Act, which extended surveillance and law-enforcement powers within the world’s most powerful nation as well. The WoT also brou­ght with it human rights concerns, es­­pe­cially about tortu­­re, detentions (for example, Guan­tá­namo Bay) and targeted killings via drones.During the initial phase of the WoT, religious ext­remism, ethnic di­­vides, and political marginalisa­­t-ion fur­ther comp-lica­t­­ed the milit­a­ncy la­­ndscape. The WoT gained impetus from globalisat­ion, technological innovations, the openness of media and the stren­gth of social media, which triggered rights and peace movements on the one hand, while enabling the speedy dissemination of hate material and fake news on the other.States with weak economies cannot completely isolate themselves as either parties or victims of violent conflicts. The survival and effectiveness of states require a greater focus on countering violent narratives, which is not possible without investing in social empowerment and improving public service delivery.Terrorism is a transnational phenomenon. There is a need for an increased realisation that terrorism and conflicts benefit only a few powerful entities, while the rest pay the costs. For powerful states and violent non-state actors, terrorism is a commercial enterprise and a source of power, pleasure, and profit. The truth is that sole reliance on military might is not an antidote.—Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nPeople in 71 local units across 20 districts in Nepal were affected by rain-induced disasters in the last week of September. Landslides and floods triggered by incessant rains resulted in massive loss of human lives and infrastructure in Bagmati Province, including the Kathmandu Valley, as well as in the hilly districts of Koshi Province. Over 250 people died as several settlements were swept away. Altogether, around 391 people were killed nationwide in water-induced disasters in the monsoon season that started in the second week of June. The disaster victims were still struggling to come to terms with their losses when people across the country were celebrating Dashain and Tihar.Now, a tougher time awaits disaster victims as the country heads into a chilly winter. The displaced people are staying under flimsy tents and tarpaulins, even as the authorities seem incapable of shifting them to temporary huts that could offer them some succour from the biting cold until their permanent houses are built. In his address to the country on October 23, nearly a month after the worst of monsoon disasters, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli directed the agencies concerned to prioritise the task of assessing damages and making temporary huts for the displaced people. In the same address, he conceded that government bodies hadn’t even assessed damages from the earthquakes that struck Jajarkot, Rukum West, Bajhang, Doti and Bajura a year ago, let alone carry out reconstruction work. The government had announced a total of Rs50,000 in two instalments to build temporary houses for those displaced in the quakes. According to the state-run newspaper The Rising Nepal, the people of Jajarkot district are yet to get the second instalment.Last winter, elderly people, children, pregnant women and those with chronic health problems suffered a lot in Jajarkot as the quake survivors had to live under flimsy tents for months due to the delay in reconstruction and rehabilitation works. When the mountainous districts witnessed rains during the winter, cold-related ailments including pneumonia caused serious problems, especially for small kids and elderly people. Owing to what can only be described as government apathy, hundreds of those displaced by natural disasters years ago can be seen staying under makeshift huts on river banks or in forest areas in various parts of the country.The problem is not always lack of resources. Mismanagement and the government’s failure to properly and timely mobilise available resources is also a reason behind the victims’ sorry plight. For instance, 77 institutional and individual donors have contributed over Rs1.87 billion to the Prime Minister’s Natural Disaster and Rescue Fund as of last week. Even in the past, disaster victims would be shivering under makeshift structures while the government would be sitting on the money donated in their name.As Nepal is vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, floods, glacial lake outbursts and lightning, relevant agencies must be well equipped to help the needy people on time. The situation won’t improve unless there are mandatory provisions with strict timelines to accomplish vital tasks such as assessing damages, shifting the displaced people to temporary huts, distributing money to build permanent houses and for rehabilitation. In the process, the role and responsibility of provinces and local units can be broadened. Also, by coming to the help of the people in times of crisis, the provincial and local governments have an opportunity to prove their relevance as self-governing entities. \nTens of thousands of people demonstrated in the eastern Spanish city of Valencia on Saturday over regional authorities’ handling of devastating floods that killed more than 220 people in one of Europe’s worst natural disasters for decades.In the latest demonstration over the floods, protesters filled the centre of Valencia demanding the resignation of regional government leader Carlos Mazon and chanting “Killers!”.“Our hands are stained with mud, yours with blood,” read one banner. Some demonstrators dumped dirty boots outside the government building while others plastered it with mud.Residents in stricken areas accuse Mazon of issuing an alert too late, at 8 p.m. on Oct. 29, well after water was already pouring into many nearby towns and villages.The Valencian leader has said he would have issued an earlier alarm earlier if authorities had been notified of the seriousness of the situation by an official water monitoring body. Mazon did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.“We want to show our indignation and anger over the poor management of this disaster which has affected so many people,” said Anna Oliver, president of Accio Cultural del Pais Valenciano, one of about 30 groups that organised the protest.Though the demonstration was largely peaceful, police charged stone-throwing protesters at one point and objects hurled at the city council building caused minor damage.Following days of storm warnings from the national weather service from Oct. 25 onward, some municipalities and local bodies raised the alarm much earlier than the regional government.For example, Valencia University told its staff on Oct. 28 not to come to work. Several town halls suspended activities, shut down public facilities and told people to stay home.Weather service AEMET raised its threat level for heavy rains in the area to a red alert at 7:36 a.m. on Oct. 29.Nearly 80 people are still missing in what is the most deadly deluge in a single European country since floods in Portugal in 1967 killed around 500. \n Qatar has told Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel it will stall its efforts to mediate a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal until they show “willingness and seriousness” to resume talks, its foreign ministry said on Saturday.The Gulf country has been working alongside the United States and Egypt for months on fruitless talks between the warring sides in Gaza and any disengagement from that process could further complicate efforts to reach a deal.The Qatari ministry also said press reports on the future of the Hamas political office in Doha were inaccurate without specifying how. Reuters had on Friday quoted a US official saying Washington had asked Qatar to expel the group and that Doha had passed this message on to Hamas.An official briefed on the matter also said on Saturday that Qatar had concluded that with its mediation efforts paused, Hamas’ political office there “no longer serves its purpose.”But three Hamas officials speaking off the record said the group had not been informed by Qatar that its leaders were no longer welcome in the country.Qatar has hosted Hamas political leaders since 2012 as part of a deal with the US, and the group’s presence there has facilitated the progress of talks.The war erupted when Hamas gunmen attacked Israeli communities on Oct. 7 2023, killing around 1,200 people and seizing another 253 as hostages. Israel’s military campaign has levelled much of Gaza and killed around 43,500 Palestinians.“Qatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in the round,” Qatar’s foreign ministry said.“Qatar will resume those efforts with its partners when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.”There was no official response from Hamas or Israel.The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal. Israel has previously rejected some proposals for longer truces. Disagreements have centred on the long-term future of Hamas and Israel’s presence in Gaza.Hamas in QatarWashington had told Qatar that Hamas’ presence in Doha was no longer acceptable in the weeks since the group rejected the October proposal, a US official said on Friday.Qatar has not set a deadline for Hamas’ political office to close or for Hamas leaders to leave Qatar, the official briefed on the matter said.Qatar’s foreign ministry said the Hamas office had been a channel of communication between the parties in Gaza and said it had contributed to a brief ceasefire and exchange of some hostages a year ago.The official briefed on the matter pointed to a previous episode in April when Qatar had reconsidered Hamas’ presence in the country, leading some Hamas officials to leave for Turkey.“After two weeks, the Biden administration and the Israeli government asked Qatar to request their return,” the official said, adding that Washington has said negotiations were ineffective when the Hamas leaders were in Turkey.Qatar, designated as a major non-NATO ally by Washington, has long sought a role as a link between Western powers and their adversaries in the region.The country hosts the largest US airbase in the Middle East but also allows Hamas and Afghanistan’s Taliban to operate offices in Doha. It also helped negotiate a prisoner exchange between the US and Iran last year.It is unclear how many Hamas officials live in Doha, but they include several possible replacements for leader Yahya Sinwar, whom Israeli forces killed in Gaza last month.They include Sinwar’s deputy Khalil al-Hayya, who has led ceasefire negotiations for the group, and Khaled Meshaal, widely seen as Hamas’ diplomatic face.The group’s previous leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Iran in July almost certainly by Israel, was also based in Doha. His body was flown to Qatar for burial in early August. \nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon over the last day have killed at least 40 people including several children, Lebanese authorities said on Saturday, after heavy Israeli bombardment pounded the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut overnight.At least seven people were killed in the coastal city of Tyre late on Friday, Lebanon’s health ministry said. The Israeli military has previously ordered swathes of the city to evacuate but there were no orders published by the Israeli military spokesperson on social media platform X before Friday’s strikes.The ministry said two children were among the dead. Rescue operations were ongoing and other body parts retrieved in the aftermath of the attack would undergo DNA testing to identify them, the ministry added.Strikes in nearby towns on Saturday killed 13 people, including seven medics from rescue groups affiliated to Hezbollah and its ally Amal, the health ministry said.At least 20 more people were killed in Israeli strikes on Saturday across the eastern plains around the historic city of Baalbek, the health ministry said.The Israeli military said it had struck Hezbollah infrastructure sites in the areas of Tyre and Baalbek, including fighters, “operational apartments,” and weapons stores.The Lebanese health ministry said Israeli attacks have killed at least 3,136 people and wounded 13,979 in Lebanon over the last year. The toll includes 619 women and 194 children.Israel has been locked in fighting with Lebanese armed group Hezbollah since October 2023, but fighting has escalated dramatically since late September of this year. Israel has intensified and expanded its bombing campaign, and Hezbollah has ramped up daily rocket and drone attacks against Israel.The Iran-backed group announced more than 20 operations on Saturday, as well as one that it said fighters carried out the previous day against a military factory south of Tel Aviv.More than a dozen Israeli strikes also hit the southern suburbs of Beirut overnight, once a bustling collection of neighbourhoods and a key stronghold of Hezbollah.Now, many buildings have been almost entirely flattened, with Hezbollah’s yellow flags jutting out from the ruins, according to Reuters reporters who were taken on a tour of the area by Hezbollah.Some buildings were partially damaged by the strikes, leading some floors to collapse and sending furniture and other personal belongings spilling onto parked cars below.Men and women were picking through the rubble for their belongings, shoving blankets and mats under their arms or into black plastic bags.“We are trying to gather as many (of our possessions) as we can, so we can manage to live off them, nothing more,” said Hassan Hannawi, one of the men looking for his belongings. \nAuthor Thomas Bell unveiled his second book, ‘Human Nature’, at a launch event hosted by KathaSatha at the Patan Museum on Saturday. The programme commenced with a conversation between Bell and Aditya Adhikari, a former journalist and columnist for the Kathmandu Post. In his conversation with Bell, Adhikari said, “The book explores the hills and mountains surrounding Kathmandu, offering much more than a travelogue. Bell has written about cultural history and the environment based on his research.” Having spent decades in Nepal, Bell’s new book blends travelogue with folklore, literature, art, and anthropology. It addresses topics like the impact of British Imperialists and external pressures on the environment.“The book is divided into four sections, featuring my four different walks through the Himalayas, each during a different season,” said Bell. In the first section, Bell delves into the theme of migration, covering various issues such as the moving of the Gurkhali soldiers, labour migrations to the Middle East, and the migration of birds, animals, and fish. He also touches on the arrival of the first settlers in the hills, Rai mythologies, and the shamanic histories of the landscapes. Similarly, the second section of the book details his journey to Dolpo. Adhikari remarked that he enjoyed reading Bell’s description of landscapes. The writer, however, mentioned, “I did not want to get too much into the whimsical description of nature, which was kind of challenging for me.”The final section documents Bell’s journey to Rara Lake, where he discusses the concept of wilderness. In his conversation with Adhikari, he said, “The idea of taming the wilderness is seen to be projected into the Himalayan region, due to which people were expelled from their homes.” He gave the example of Rara Lake, where residents were displaced to transform the area into the national park it is today. “On writing this book, I cast my net as far as it could reach because the subject of social issues is so expansive.” Bell mentioned that he relied on historian Mahesh Chandra Regmi's research and cited author Shanker Koirala as a reference from his work ‘Khaireni Ghat’. Bell also read a brief excerpt from his book and answered questions from the audience. In answering the audience queries, Adhikari emphasised that ‘Human Nature’ is mainly written for a Nepali audience, aiming to resonate more with local than international readers.Guests, including actress Manisha Koirala and writers Amish Raj Mulmi, Rishi Amatya, and Dia Yonzon, attended the event.  \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast partly cloudy skies in Nepal’s hilly areas on Sunday, with fair to partly cloudy conditions across the rest of the country. Light rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is likely in some hilly regions, with a chance of light snowfall in a few high hilly and mountainous areas.Similar conditions are expected tonight, with partly cloudy skies in hilly areas and fair weather in the rest of the country. Light rain or thunderstorms may occur in some hilly regions, while light snowfall is possible in higher-altitude areas.The division attributed these conditions to the partial influence of western and local winds across the country.On Saturday, Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 35.5°C, Jomsom the lowest at 2.5°C, and Dharan received the most rainfall at 13.8 mm. \nLilaballabh Adhikari, a provincial assembly member from the CPN-UML has been suspended from his party following allegations of involvement in a human trafficking case.Adhikari, who was law and internal affairs minister in the Koshi provincial government, resigned from the ministerial position on Wednesday after he landed in controversy over his visit to Japan without permission or prior notification. UML's Koshi Province chair Ghanashyam Khatiwada, issuing a statement on Saturday, said that Adhikari’s party membership has been suspended until the investigations reach a conclusion.“In light of the seriousness of the human trafficking allegations, we urge the government and relevant authorities to conduct a swift and thorough investigation. Until a conclusive resolution is reached, Adhikari is suspended from his role in all the party structures, including as a member of the National Convention Representative Council,” Khatiwada said.The controversy emerged when Adhikari, along with three other individuals, was sent back from Tokyo after being flagged by Japanese immigration due to suspicious documentation. Adhikari, who reportedly bypassed required travel protocols, subsequently resigned from his ministerial post amidst mounting ethical concerns.Nepal Police’s initial findings show that those who allegedly forged passports and went to Japan with Adhikari had paid Rs1 million each to attend an event in Tokyo.Adhikari departed for Japan on October 29 without informing the authorities concerned to attend an event organised by the Tokyo Metropolitan.The other three individuals who accompanied him were detained for investigation by the police, but Adhikari avoided arrest by presenting his ministerial identification. As of Saturday, he has not been apprehended.Adhikari, a lawyer by profession, represents Morang Constituency 2 (B) and has served multiple terms in the provincial assembly.Organising a press meet immediately after tendering resignation from the ministerial position, he claimed that he wasn’t involved in any illegal activity.In the meantime, the meeting of the UML Secretariat held in Kathmandu on Saturday endorsed the province committee’s action against Adhikari and also urged the government to conduct a fact-based and thorough investigation into the case. \nThe central committee meeting of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) on Saturday announced plans to initiate a second phase of protests, against what it describes as the government’s “authoritarian and autocratic tendencies.”The central committee meeting described the arrest of party chairperson Rabi Lamichhane as a deliberate attempt by the ruling coalition to politically corner the RSP.“Although the parliamentary investigation committee’s report on page 449 states there is no documented evidence implicating Rabi Lamichhane in the transfer of funds from the cooperative organisation to Gorkha Media Pvt Ltd, he was still arrested. This arrest clearly indicates the ruling coalition’s objective to politically corner the RSP,” reads the statement issued after the meeting.The RSP has called one and all to support its second phase of the protests.The party accused parties historically advocating for political freedom of now stifling new ideas and voices. The government’s actions, the party claims, are against the democratic values, constitution, and rule of law. “The RSP urges the general public to read the state’s dangerous character properly,” the party stated.Last month, police arrested Lamichhane to investigate charges of cooperative fraud and organised crime. He was taken to Pokhara as a case against him was filed at the Kaski district police office. The Kaski district court extended his remand on Tuesday.Also, a case has been filed against Lamichhane at the Rupandehi district police office and the court in the district has also allowed the police to arrest him for the investigation on charges of fraud. He has been accused of misusing millions of rupees from various cooperatives. \nWith Donald Trump returning to the White House, there are concerns over how his second term will shape the US foreign policy at large. And what will be its South Asia policy and by extension an outlook towards Nepal?Trumps’ ‘America First’ policy is seen as Washington’s possible drift towards isolationism but his South Asia policy could be guided by his closeness and personal bond with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Strengthening strategic ties between New Delhi and Washington and the evolution of Beijing-Washington ties are other factors to watch out, observers say.Former Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey said Nepal’s relations with the United States will remain unchanged irrespective of who enters the White House—a Republican or a Democrat.Nepal and the United States forged diplomatic relations on April 25, 1947, becoming only the second country to do so after the UK. Nepal established its embassy in Washington DC on February 3, 1958, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On August 6, 1959, the American Embassy in Kathmandu was set up. A number of Nepal’s honorary consuls are stationed in various US cities and a large number of Nepali nationals now live and work in the country.A Republican occupied the White House when Nepal and the US established diplomatic relations, said Pandey. Also, when Nepal opened its embassy in Washington DC and the US did so in Kathmandu, a Republican was at the helm. “When King Mahendra addressed the joint session of US Congress in 1960, a Republican president was in power. Later, when he travelled to the United States in 1967, a Democratic president governed the country. Then, when King Birendra paid a state visit to the US in 1983, there was a Republican president,” said Pandey. “This suggests that the US policy towards Nepal has been stable and smooth.”Though Nepal-US relations have been changing for the better, during Trump’s first presidency between January 20, 2017 and January 20, 2021, bilateral ties took a dip due to the controversy over accepting the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s $500 million grant.The MCC became controversial in Nepal and stirred up debates. After Washington’s repeated clarifications that MCC is not aligned with the US’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and introduction of the 12-point interpretive declaration, the US grant was ratified by the House of Representatives in February 2022. Nepal has also invested $197 million in the MCC projects.During Trump’s first term as president, the American request for Nepal to join the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and State Partnership Program also caused unease in Nepal. Successive governments have clarified that Nepal does not intend to join these two US initiatives.Nepal’s former permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva Sambhu Ram Simkhada hopes that relations between Nepal and the US will remain good in Trump’s second term.“But it is more important to see how relations between powerful countries evolve during Trump’s second term,” he said.In Trump’s first term, some of his decisions like withdrawing from the Paris climate pact, the World Health Organisation, ending US support for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and blocking abortion rights had an impact on Nepal as well. Nepal is looking for compensation for the damages from adverse effects of climate change, which is triggered mainly by the greenhouse gases emitted by large industrial countries.Nepal must tread carefully, said Pandey, especially with the US citizens electing a decisive president who wants no delays in action. Like Simkhada, former minister Pandey also believes that evolving ties between the US, India and China will shape Washington’s policy towards Kathmandu.Nepal is on the strategic radars of India, China and the US, said Pandey. “Therefore, it should be careful while navigating its relations with these three powers. Nepal should maintain healthy relations with both India and China.”Nepal should not be tempted to use its ties with one neighbour against the other, Pandey added.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has yet to issue a congratulatory message on Trump’s election but President Ramchandra Paudel and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli have congratulated the president-elect.In his congratulatory message on Wednesday, Paudel expressed confidence that the Nepal-US relationship would be further strengthened during Trump’s second term.Prime Minister Oli on Thursday stated that Trump’s return to the Oval Office is a historic chapter in American history. Oli also said that he looks forward to deepening Nepal-US relations, fostering mutual prosperity and cooperation under Trump’s leadership.“It would be interesting to see how the US relations with India and China evolve,” said Simkhada. “That will have a big bearing on Nepal-US relations, perhaps as much as Nepal’s own relations with these three powers.” Former Nepali ambassador to the United States Arjun Karki said that the US policy towards Nepal will remain unchanged despite changes in the US government as Kathmandu has already worked with the Trump administration. Karki served as Nepal’s ambassador to the United States during Trump’s first term. “But yes, some global policies he pursues might impact Nepal.”“In his first term, Trump cut or downsized the US funds in areas like climate change, access to the abortion rights, health, and financial assistance to the World Health Organization. If he continues on the same path, Nepal will be affected,” said Karki, who served as Nepal’s US envoy from 2015 to 2021.Karki believes the US policy towards Russia and Israel will change but not so much its outlook towards China. “Perhaps some of Trump’s interventionist policies might even be to Nepal’s benefit,” he adds.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \nIt’s now all but certain: Oli will visit China in early December. This trip would mark a break from the tradition of Nepali prime ministers making their first “official” visit to India. There is nothing to quibble about, as flying to New Delhi first is merely an unwritten custom, not a formal requirement. So, Oli’s planned visit to Beijing isn’t a breach of any protocol; rather, it could set a precedent.Yet questions have lingered over why Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hasn’t extended an invitation to Oli, sparking speculation that Oli began planning a trip to China after waiting in vain for an invite from New Delhi. In some circles, there is a belief that Oli’s ascension to power is not to India’s liking. Some within Oli’s orbit have remarked that certain foreign powers have been trying to unseat the government without providing evidence to support this claim.Oli and India amid global shiftsEven Oli can’t deny that his past actions and rhetoric have frequently irked New Delhi. While his assertive stance may have earned him a “nationalist” image among sections of Nepali society, it has also placed him in India’s bad books. Attempts at rapprochement have been met with a cold shoulder, leaving him to orchestrate his return to power. Since the 2022 elections, he’s worn many hats: Coalition partner, opposition leader, and now, once again, prime minister.Yet India appears unconvinced. While Modi’s government rolled out the red carpet for Arzu Rana Deuba of the Nepali Congress, who serves as foreign minister in Oli’s Cabinet, it has yet to extend an invitation to Oli, despite him being in office for over 100 days and even meeting Modi in New York in September. Meanwhile, Oli’s government has repeatedly signalled its keenness to host Modi in Nepal, failing to elicit any concrete response.Then, has India abandoned its long-standing tradition of hosting the Nepali prime minister soon after a new government is formed? If so, this raises broader questions about India’s much-touted “Neighborhood First” policy. Extending an invitation to Oli could have shown goodwill and reinforced New Delhi’s proclamation that “Nepal is a special priority partner.”Amid rapid geopolitical shifts, India may have set its sights on bigger platforms and larger roles in the world order, but it would do well not to ignore its neighbours or treat them based on the government of the day. On Nepal’s part, its foreign policy is becoming increasingly complex, extending beyond bilateral ties with India and China, as Sino-Indian and Sino-American tensions and interests intersect more with a growing US influence in Asia amid shifting global dynamics. Oli, as the incumbent, needs to tread carefully. His role demands deft management of relations with India and China while also recalibrating Nepal’s strategic posture in a complex and evolving geopolitical landscape.The northern nexusNepal’s communist leaders often lean towards, or appear to align with, China when they want to “send a message” to India. Oli is no exception. Even before an official invitation was extended, extensive media reports outlined Oli’s potential agenda for the trip, including efforts to secure a loan waiver for the Pokhara International Airport and agreements on some Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. The Chinese, who often practise quiet diplomacy, have yet to comment on Oli's planned visit. Meanwhile, the BRI remains a contentious issue in Nepal, with Beijing eager to reframe all China-funded projects under its banner. Oli currently leads a strong government with support from the Nepali Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Congress’s position on the BRI and other forms of assistance is clear—grants are acceptable but loans are not. If Oli avoids pushing too aggressively with China, potentially unsettling his coalition partner, his position remains secure. Deeper engagement with China could bring valuable infrastructure projects, but it also raises concerns about long-term dependency and potential political leverage. It’s up to Nepali leaders—especially Oli—to negotiate beneficial terms.The Nepali public is divided on Chinese aid: Some see it as a counterbalance to dependence on India, while others fear it might lead to undue influence from the north. Both views have merit and flaws, making it crucial for the current leadership to steer Nepal’s foreign policy in a direction that serves and safeguards the country’s interests.While Nepal could benefit from its northern neighbour’s economic and technological might, it is not in a position to ignore its southern neighbour, with whom it not only shares historical, cultural and people-to-people ties but also carries out a majority of its trade.The catchDiplomacy often works best when conducted quietly. Oli’s “preparations” to visit Beijing could have been kept under wraps until concrete plans were in place. The premature leak of his intentions by his circle allows room for speculation that this may have been a tactic to pressure India.While China seeks to expand its influence in Nepal, it remains cautious about provoking India to the point of confrontation. And India, too, appears hesitant to employ its usual political manoeuvres in Nepal, particularly after recent setbacks in its immediate neighbourhood. As the Sino-Indian relations show signs of thawing, Nepal stands to benefit from reduced regional tension. Oli would be wise to avoid antagonising either neighbour.Nonetheless, Oli has an uncanny inclination to critique India. While he uses backchannels to re-engage with New Delhi, his public jabs at India reveal his characteristic defiance. If his plan to visit China is driven more by spite than by a balanced foreign policy strategy, he risks making a strategic misstep.Even after over 100 days in office, Oli’s performance has been dismal on various domestic fronts. Neither Oli nor his coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, has been able to justify the formation of this “stable” government.With his political legacy on the line, Oli has an opportunity to “achieve something meaningful” as prime minister, and he should approach foreign policy with a view toward lasting impact.Foreign policy is certainly a tough balancing act for a country like Nepal, sandwiched between the world’s two large economies. In an era of fluid geopolitics, future Nepali leaders will likely face further challenges in balancing relations with both neighbours. Nepali politicians’ failure to pursue a cohesive and balanced foreign policy has already tarnished Nepal’s international image.In the intricate world of foreign policy, there’s little room for grandstanding. And, adventurism can backfire. Oli has a unique chance to set a precedent for independent, balanced diplomacy that could serve as a model for the country and his successors.His China sojourn could go beyond simply breaking the so-called custom of prioritising one neighbour over the other; it might even pave the way for a new approach. But this must be done in the best interest of Nepal, not to satisfy personal pride or vanity. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is known for his supposed ability to implement decisions and accomplish the tasks he takes up even at the cost of becoming unpopular.But a series of events after he became prime minister in mid-July tells a different story.In the three and half months since he assumed office at Singha Durbar, the prime minister has been compelled to backtrack on a couple of his plans or postpone them.In the first week of September, Prime Minister Oli pushed a plan to remove Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar from the post and elect a lawmaker from the ruling Nepali Congress in her place. According to multiple leaders privy to the development, by electing a Congress lawmaker as deputy speaker, Oli wanted to strengthen relations with the major coalition partner Congress, which has more seats than the prime minister’s party, the CPN-UML, in the House of Representatives. Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba has a special interest in getting a lawmaker from his party elected to the post, as deputy speaker is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which nominates members and heads of constitutional bodies.The prime minister on September 9 convened a meeting of the ruling parties and floated a proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar and sought a green signal from the coalition partners to his plan.After the meeting, party leaders told the Post that Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office. Deputy Speaker Magar courted controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role. On February 26 last year, Magar wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting a visa interview for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she was under pressure to step down.Last month, the prime minister held several meetings and consultations with a plan to introduce an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act-2017 with an intention to facilitate party splits. This plan also drew widespread criticism as leaders from various political parties and independent observers accused the prime minister of plotting splits of fringe political parties with a plan to merge their dissident groups into the UML.His proposal to introduce ordinance was reportedly floated in order to merge the Ashok-Rai led Janata Socialist Party and the dissident group from the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), which in turn would make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives.As the major coalition partner, the Congress, reportedly did not back his proposal to introduce the ordinance, Oli was again pushed to the back seat.These are just a few cases in point. Oli from the start of this tenure has struggled to assert his authority.Professor of political science Krishna Pokharel assesses that there may have been an understanding between Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli to arrest Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane, who was accused of misappropriating cooperative funds, and issuing an ordinance related to political parties.Pokharel believes that the two leaders might have reached a deal to accomplish the two goals—bring an ordinance to facilitate the split of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which was formed in 2021 after breaking away from the UML; and arrest Lamichhane. Lamichhane, the immediate past home minister, had reportedly tried to arrest Congress chief Deuba’s spouse (current foreign minister) Arzu Rana Deuba, on charges of involvement in the Bhutanese refugee scam. “While the wish of the Congress chief was fulfilled, the interest of the UML chair and the prime minister was not,” Pokharel said. However, the UML leaders don’t buy this argument. Vice-chair Yubaraj Gyawali said that the government under UML leadership has just completed its 100 days, so it is too early to judge its performance. “There are many good initiatives taken by this government whose results will come in due course,” Gyawali told the Post. “Everything that the head of the government wants cannot be achieved in such a short period, but that does not mean his influence has waned.” But some political analysts say that Oli’s standing has declined since he became prime minister this time with the support of Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Oli dismisses those who claim his influence has gone down. While addressing the symposium on ‘Role of former security personnel in National Security and Development’ organised by the Nepal National Former Army and Police Association on October 27, Oli rubbished claims that his influence was steadily decreasing.“Those who claim my charm has decreased will know the reality in the 2027 election,” Oli said.Sarita Bhusal, a UML lawmaker, said a mistaken impression might have been created among the people. “Sometimes there are constraints to leading a coalition government,” Bhusal told the Post.Gyawali, a vice chair of the UML, agrees. “Earlier, Oli became prime minister with the support of smaller parties. But this time, he has the backing of the largest party in Parliament, so it is not easy for him to do all that he wants.” Oli first headed a coalition government after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. When he became prime minister again in 2018 after the 2017 election, his party was the largest in the House. He became prime minister with the support of the Maoist Centre, which was his coalition partner during his previous stint as well.The Congress publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, said his party has been giving full support to the Oli government. “Our party has not opposed any government programme that is good for the country,” Bishwakarma told the Post. “We only caution the government on issues that may cause public backlash.”This government was formed in the spirit of a seven-point agreement between the two parties, and achieving those objectives must be its primary focus, Bishawakarma said. Of late, Oli has also faced criticism from within his party. Some UML leaders publicly opposed his recent decision to accept a donation from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of Bhatbhateni Supermarket, for the construction of the party’s head office. Experts see it as a sign of his decreasing hold in the party organisation. Although party’s standing committee member Binda Pandey and central committee member Ushakiran Timilsina protested against it publicly, other party leaders are also reportedly dissatisfied with Oli’s decision.Bhim Rawal, who contested the election for chair against Oli during the party’s 10th general convention in Chitwan in November 2021, also criticised Oli for accepting the donation. Sidelined by Oli, Rawal is currently inactive in the party. Even leaders like Gokul Baskota, who used to be a staunch Oli supporter, couldn’t back him on the deal with businessman Gurung.In an interview with Image television, Baskota said, “The UML cannot accept Gurung’s donation and carry his old baggage.” On October 28, the Supreme Court issued an interlocutory interim order barring the ruling party, UML, from building any structure on the land donated by businessman Gurung. A single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel said the UML-Gurung donation deal was illegal prima facie, putting Oli further on the defensive. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nEveryone is after contentment in life. Whether studying, working, or earning, our actions aim to achieve happiness. The desire for eternal happiness and peace is deeply rooted in human nature. ‘Ananda Samhita’ by Ghanashyam Khadka explores this universal pursuit: what happiness and sadness mean. It examines how people chase after happiness and suggests alternative approaches that might lead to fulfilment and inner peace.This book guides us to find peace and happiness within ourselves, independent of external or superficial influences. The author explains that people often chase happiness in ways that lead to disappointment. If happiness is dependent on fleeting moments, it isn’t true happiness. Instead, joy should be enduring and accessible of reason—if one can be happy without cause, nothing can take that joy away. Happiness and peace are ongoing states that come from within.The author suggests that sadness often arises from a lack of self-awareness. Happiness and sadness, he argues, aren’t the outcomes of events but rather our attitudes toward them. A positive approach to life can transform difficulties into opportunities, turning darkness into light and challenges into growth. Staying peaceful is an art; it doesn’t come by birth and can be achieved by preparation. The author explains everything in detail, helping readers grasp the content quickly. He uses relatable examples to bring depth to the ideas, encouraging readers to apply them to everyday life. This book contains questions and reflective activities that make us contemplate our lives. Khadka writes, “In the universe, we are very tiny; thus, stressing over minimal things and being sad is not worthy.” The book unfolds over 18 interconnected chapters, each guiding the reader to self-discovery and inner peace. Every chapter introduces a new concept and topic, which is also the chapter’s theme, building on the last and adding new layers. The author explains how the presence and absence of particular qualities or perspectives can shape our pursuit of peace, making each chapter a stepping stone toward achieving a more profound sense of contentment.The author has included different stories to bring the concepts to life, keeping readers engaged. These stories serve as relatable examples, making the ideas more memorable. For instance, he shares the story of a famous scientist, Albert Einstein, and his driver to illustrate how we naturally adopt traits from those we spend time with. This leads to his advice: surround yourself with people who inspire you, are intellectually curious, and are self-aware.While reading the book, I applied many suggested mindfulness practices and self-help tips. While philosophical books like this may not appeal to everyone, ‘Ananda Samhita’ engages readers with reflective activities at the end of each chapter, making them more interactive and applicable to daily life.Each activity encourages us to reflect on the chapter’s insights and integrate them into our daily lives. As I read through the activity guidelines and tried a few, it felt like meditating while listening to Prawachan. Yet, I struggled to concentrate and thoroughly follow the instructions. This experience made me realise that a calm, focused mindset is essential to truly absorb this book's wisdom and put its teachings into practice. Although reaching this level of immersion might seem unrealistic in our hectic lives, it’s precisely for this reason that the book was written.All the activities focus on positive self-talk and affirmations, which soothe the mind and heart, bring calmness, and build self-confidence. As the saying goes, “You become what you feed your mind.” We can move toward a positive life by practising positive affirmations and cultivating an optimistic inner dialogue.The writer advises that we should master our hearts rather than be ruled by them. He explains that true happiness and salvation remain out of reach if our hearts control us. By embracing our inevitable death, we can learn to value each moment, allowing us to live more fully in the present. This acceptance, he argues, leads to a deep awakening to life’s true worth.The author draws on the story of Siddhartha Gautam, who left his palace comforts upon realising death's inevitability. Gautam’s choice to renounce superficial pursuits underscores the importance of focusing on meaningful goals rather than allowing trivial distractions to sidetrack us. Life is uncertain, and by keeping this in mind, we can better appreciate its value and avoid wasting time on distractions that pull us away from our ultimate purpose, salvation.Moreover, the author backs the text with data, statistics, and insights from psychological theories by figures like Sigmund Freud, Carl Rogers, and Abraham Maslow, as well as scientific principles. He also incorporates Nepali proverbs and cultural sayings to ground complex ideas in relatable language. Khadka also talks about the teachings of Buddha and uses them as a reference. This blend of psychology, science, and spirituality creates a well-rounded and accessible framework for readers, making profound ideas easier to grasp.That said, this book may not resonate with everyone. As someone who doesn’t usually gravitate toward philosophical texts, I found ‘Ananda Samhita’ both challenging and thought-provoking. The author delves into philosophical, spiritual, and idealistic ideas that sometimes seem abstract or impractical yet carry profound meanings. While I respect the message about striving for peace and ending suffering permanently, I find it challenging to agree. In today’s fast-paced, highly competitive world, such ideals can feel out of reach and perhaps impractical for many.Additionally, the book introduces complex terms and concepts that, despite explanations, may still feel elusive to some readers. ‘Ananda Samhita’ is a thoughtfully researched book offering valuable insights into understanding our inner selves—something many overlook. The author’s engaging writing style captivates readers. The book also challenges our attachment to worldly possessions and questions how we perceive life, happiness, and sadness. Fresh perspectives in the text invite readers to reflect on their lives and guide them toward peace and happiness.Ananda SamhitaAuthor: Ghanashyam KhadkaYear: 2024Publisher: Alchemy PublicationPages: 231 \nThe next general elections are three years away, but political parties have already started devising strategies to secure victory.While all major parties are discussing ‘mission 84’ (election year 2084 BS, or 2027 AD), the CPN-UML is ahead of others in formulating strategies as much as it plans to collect private information on individual voters. In a bid to assess its strength, the ruling party has decided to find out the political affiliation of each voter.The country's second-largest party will send its volunteers to each household to find out the political leanings of the members. “Our local cadres know who our sympathisers are and who is associated with other parties. The study aims to find out the political inclination of those whose affiliations are not known,” Bishal Bhattarai, a UML politburo member and member of the party’s Organisation Department, told the Post. Such study has already started in local units where byelections are being held next month. The voting is taking place for 44 positions including mayors and chiefs of rural municipalities in 33 local units across the seven provinces on December 1. The seats had turned vacant due to deaths and resignations, and other reasons. The party plans to conduct the nationwide study for two months, from mid-February to mid-April next year. As per the schedule, the party’s central office will receive the reports from the local level by the end of the current fiscal year—mid-July.Party leaders claim the survey is for the party’s internal purposes to evaluate its strengths. “Based on the report, the party will devise its strategy to strengthen its positions wherever it is weak. Such surveys are done in other countries as well,” Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the party, told the Post.However, political experts don’t think the matter is as simple as the UML is trying to project. Krishna Khanal, professor of political science, said in principle there is nothing wrong with conducting surveys to collect information to devise strategies to mobilise party. “However, in a country like ours where the government’s treatment of people often depends upon their party affiliation, the ruling party studying the common people’s political affiliation is a serious matter. It will not only intimidate ordinary people, but also raises concerns that state machinery could be misused to bring neutral voters into the UML’s camp,” he told the Post.Some political analysts see this move as an intrusion into personal matters. Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, collecting information of individual party affiliation is not an acceptable act in democracy. “The UML is trying to adopt a radical communist strategy. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) applied a similar strategy to remain in power for long,” he told the Post.Not just the radical communists but right wing forces in India too are embracing a similar strategy to turn election results in their favour. During every election, from the municipal to Lok Sabha, India’s Bharatiya Janata Party appoints panna pramukhs (unit incharges), who are tasked with influencing voters at the household level.Every constituency is divided into blocks, with lists of voters from every 10 to 12 families. And a person called panna pramukh is assigned to pay special attention to the families of his/her designated area. Their job is to convince them to vote for the party. This strategy seems to have worked for the right-wing party, which won the elections for the third consecutive time in June. “It is not surprising to see that extremists, no matter whether they are right wing or left wing, adopt similar strategies,” said Pyakurel. The UML, which has seen a decline in the number of its organised cadres, wants to increase their numbers to at least one million which hovers around half that figure at present. It believes it can devise policy to increase its vote base based on the survey results. In the 2022 general elections, the country had 17.79 million registered voters.Pyakurel, however, doesn’t believe that the UML’s initiative is going to benefit it hugely during the elections. If his claims are anything to go by, swing voters have a significant share in Nepal and no single strategy by the UML is likely to guarantee results in the next general elections. Nepal is the country where pre-poll surveys are illegal although they are practiced elsewhere in the world. However, there is no restriction on a ruling party gathering information on people’s political affiliations. “The Election Commission must come forward to stop the UML’s move,” said Khanal, the professor.The UML leaders, however, say there is no need to ‘make a mountain out of a molehill’. “This is just the party’s internal survey. We are sensitive enough to individual freedom and the right to privacy,” said Bhattarai. \nPolitical parties have expedited their preparations for the by-elections slated for next month in various local units.The by-elections will be held on December 1 for various positions that went vacant due to various reasons after the local elections in 2022.As the Election Commission has fixed November 18 for filing the candidacy, parties are busy selecting their candidates for the 44 vacant seats ranging from the chief of the district coordination committees to the ward chairpersons.The voters from different local units will vote to elect two chiefs of the district coordination committees, chairpersons of two rural municipalities, four vice-chairs, one mayor, one deputy mayor and chairs of 34 wards. Votes will also be cast to elect chiefs of the district coordination committees in Okhaldhunga and Kailali, the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in Kathmandu, and the deputy mayor of Nalagad Municipality in Jajarkot.Similarly, the elections will be held to elect chairpersons of Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang and Mahabu Rural Municipality in Dailekh, and the vice-chairs of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality in Dolakha, Sarkegad Rural Municipality in Humla and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura.Additionally, elections will take place to elect ward chair positions in various local units including in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City and Kirtipur Municipality.The Local Level Election Act, 2016 envisions by-elections to fill vacant positions such as district coordination committee heads, vice-heads, rural municipality chairs, vice-chairs, mayors, deputy mayors, and ward chairs if their term has not expired and has more than a year left with for their term. The representatives in all the vacant positions were elected on May 13, 2022 with just half of their terms completed so far.Suman Ghimire, information officer at the commission, said the nominations can be filed during the office hours on November 17 and the list of candidates will be published by 6 pm the same day.Anyone who has an objection to the candidacy of any contestant can lodge the complaint the next day. Similarly, candidates will be allowed to withdraw their candidacies, if they wish so, by 1 pm on October 20.The final list of the candidates from all the vacant positions will be published the same day while the election symbols too will be allotted between 3 pm to 5 pm on the day.“Twenty-five parties have been registered in the commission to compete in the by-polls,” said Ghimire.According to the constitutional poll management body, the mayoral and deputy mayoral candidates can spend a maximum of Rs450,000, rural municipality chairs and vice-chairs are allowed to spend up to Rs350,000 while the aspirants for the district coordination committee chief and deputy can spend up to Rs50,000.Rs300,000 is the maximum amount the candidates for metropolitan city ward chairs can spend but the ceiling is Rs200,000 and Rs150,000 for the ward chairpersons of the municipality and rural municipality, respectively.The main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre) is ahead of other major parties in candidate selection. It has decided to field Shivsharan Maharjan, a professor by profession, for the vacant mayor's position in Kirtipur Municipality. It has picked Nimleki Sherpa for the vice-chairperson position in Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha. The third largest party has also finalised its candidates for the ward chairpersons in most of the local units where the by-polls are going to take place.The ruling CPN-UML has picked the contenders for by-elections in the local units from Kathmandu but is yet to decide for other parts. Surendra Manandhar, a UML central committee member, is the party’s mayoral candidate in Kirtipur. Laxmi Ratna Tuladhar will contest for chairperson of ward 16 of the Kathmandu Metropolis from the UML.Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the second largest party, said all the party’s candidates will be finalised within a couple of days.The Nepali Congress, on the other hand, has already received lists of the probable candidates from the respective local units but is yet to finalise the names. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which came into existence after the 2022’s local elections, is also preparing to contest the by-polls this time.All the parties, including those who had contested earlier polls forming pre-poll alliances, have announced they’d contest the upcoming elections independently. \nTwo ruling parties have formed a three-tier political mechanism—at the centre, in the provinces and in the districts—in order to facilitate the government of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML at the centre and to resolve any disputes at the provincial and district levels.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba will head the mechanism, according to a statement issued by the secretariat of the newly announced body on Wednesday. The first meeting of the mechanism was held on Tuesday. At the central level, they formed an eight-member team with four members from each party. Among them are the parties’ office bearers and ministers in the Oli Cabinet. However, in the provinces and districts, each party will have three representatives in the task force.The decision to form the joint mechanism is aimed at minimising the differences between the two parties, supporting the spirit of government formation agreed in mid-July when the parties came together, according to ruling party leaders.The development comes at a time when the popularity of the Oli government is dipping as it fails to revive the ailing economy, unlike what was promised in mid-July. The mechanism is also tasked with removing the obstacles to the two parties’ coalition so that it continues to govern until the elections in 2027. Formation of the mechanisms at provincial and district levels are said to be in the final stage.Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak are Congress members in the task force while UML senior vice-chairman Ishwar Pokhrel, General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel and deputy general secretary Bishnu Rimal are representing Oli.The decision was made on October 31, Rimal told the Post. The objectives of the mechanism are to support and facilitate the works of the three-tier government.Representatives from the two parties will lead the mechanism by turns. Khadka of the Congress will coordinate the meetings for a month from November 5. At the provincial level, Congress provincial party chief, incumbent chief minister or the parliamentary party leader (in case the party is not leading the provincial government) and the senior member of the provincial Cabinet will be members of the task force.From the UML, provincial party chair, provincial in-charge and parliamentary party leader will be members of the task force, said Rimal. At the district level, Congress party president and two office bearers will be the members.The UML district in-charge, party chair and secretary will be represented in the task force, according to Rimal.The political mechanism also announced the visit of Prime Minister Oli to China scheduled for December 2-6. But the government is yet to make a formal announcement of the visit. At the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, prime minister Oli is paying an official visit to China in December. As per the instructions of Prime Minister Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana will coordinate the visit. The task force will lay the groundwork for the visit , the statement added. Rana has already cancelled her scheduled trip to Baku, Azerbaijan where she was to attend the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference. President Ramchandra Paudel is leading the Nepali delegation in the UN climate change conference. The main objective of the three-tire mechanism is to assist and support the federal, provincial and local governments, said Rimal. The provincial and district level mechanisms will resolve disputes related to government functioning, he added. “The main purpose of the mechanisms is to convince people that the government will deliver and address their needs. The mechanism will help restore trust and hope and will solidify the Congress-UML alliance,” added Rimal.Leaders said that there is good working relations between the two parties at all three levels.“This government will complete its full term. The current political Oli-Deuba partnership is doing well as there is a high level of mutual trust,” said Rimal. He said the government would stay intact so long as the trust between Oli and Deuba remains intact and so long as the UML remains a united party. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nTen people were injured in a bus accident at Ghumaune in Kharipati of Bhaktapur district on Tuesday. Two are reportedly in critical condition.According to Pradeep Khatri, a traffic police inspector and chief of the District Traffic Police Range, the bus coming from Talakot of Changunarayan Municipality lost its control and hit a pole. The injured are undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital, police said. \nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nThe heavy rainfall in late September, which triggered floods and landslides in most parts of the country, caused a loss of Rs46.68 billion to Nepal’s economy, nearly three-fold more than the initial estimates.According to the preliminary loss and damage assessment report released by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority under the home ministry on Thursday, the floods and landslides from September 26 to 28 caused significant damage to the physical infrastructure sector, followed by the social and productive sectors.According to the report, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology reported that out of 222 rainfall measurement stations across Nepal, 77 recorded heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving over 200 millimetres in just 24 hours. Kathmandu experienced its highest rainfall on record, surpassing previous measurements set in 2002. The Tribhuvan International Airport station recorded 239.7 millimetres of rain, highlighting the intensity of the weather system affecting the region.More than 83 percent of the total economic losses were observed in the physical infrastructures, amounting to Rs38.92 billion.The report said that 41 roads and highways were damaged. The estimated cost of repairing and maintaining the roads and highway infrastructure is Rs27.98 billion. Blocked or damaged roads hinder transportation and supply chains, complicating relief efforts and economic recovery.In the hydropower sector, the damage to 26 facilities has caused an estimated loss of Rs30.18 billion. This loss has significantly hit energy supply, impacting residential and industrial consumers.Nepal’s electricity imports are likely to surge this winter due to the delay in the reconstruction of hydropower plants. The 456MW Upper Tamakoshi hydropower project, Nepal’s largest in operation, has failed to resume generation since late September. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, 980MW of output has been interrupted.Similarly, damage to 446 telecommunication units has resulted in a loss of R152.30 million.The destruction of 1,678 federal and provincial water supply and sanitation systems has led to an estimated loss of Rs5.90 billion. The report said that the loss affects access to clean water and poses health risks, particularly in the wake of disasters that often exacerbate waterborne diseases.Forty-four bridges sustained damage, resulting in an estimated financial loss of Rs1.04 billion. The report said the damage severely hampers connectivity and affects transportation and logistics in the region.The social sector has experienced profound impacts, particularly in housing and settlements. As per initial reports, 5,996 houses were destroyed, while 13,049 were damaged. This destruction has displaced 10,807 families, impacting 16,243 individuals who are now living in public shelters and facing challenges in finding basic amenities, according to the report.Six infrastructures were fully destroyed in the health sector, and 43 health facilities were partially destroyed. This limits access to essential medical services during a critical time when health needs are heightened due to potential post-disaster health crises. The education sector has not been spared either, with six schools destroyed completely and 136 schools partially damaged, further disrupting education for countless children.There were 249 deaths and 178 injuries, and 18 persons are still missing, the report said. The highest number of fatalities have been reported in Dhading, followed by Kavre and Lalitpur districts. In terms of human impact, Bagmati reported the highest fatalities at 208, while Koshi saw 20 deaths. The report said over 17,000 individuals were rescued, and more than 14,800 police personnel were deployed across affected areas. The most extensive police operations were in Kathmandu Valley and several districts in the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces. In the productive sector, agriculture and livestock incurred substantial losses. The assessment indicates that 65,380 hectares of agricultural land and 26,698 livestock have been affected, resulting in an estimated economic loss of Rs5.88 billion. The report said that the significant impact on agriculture threatens food security and farmers' livelihoods, who rely heavily on their land and livestock for income.Seven irrigation projects have been affected, leading to a loss of Rs1.35 billion. The destruction of irrigation infrastructure jeopardises crop yields and exacerbates the agricultural crisis after the disasters.This assessment underscores the vulnerabilities of the affected sectors and the importance of comprehensive disaster preparedness and resilience-building measures to mitigate future risks.Bagmati province reported the most extensive damage, with 424 houses destroyed and 743 impacted.Bagmati province reported the highest levels of destruction, with 4,414 houses fully destroyed and 7,157 partially destroyed, affecting more than 14,517 families and displacing 9,997 families. Kavrepalanchok district was particularly hit, with 3,121 houses fully destroyed and 5,749 partially destroyed.  \n\nKaski residents have started redeveloping the Krapu Kwholasothar trail, a circuit trek of religious and historical significance that remains unexplored.Kwhlosothar, located 3,283 metres above sea level, is in the southern part of Annapurna and Lamjung. It can be reached through Tangting, Sikles, Kori and Yangjakot of Kaski and Pasgaun, Bhujung, and Ghanpokhari of Lamjung.The shortest route is from Tangting.Locals say it's not just an ordinary trekking trail for it connects Kwholasothar, an ancient village believed to be Nepal's first Gurung or Tamu settlement, with ruins of an ancient town over 1500-1200 years old.Until half a decade ago, northern Kaski and Lamjung locals used this route to bring salt from Tibet.A decade ago, a joint research team from Cambridge University of the UK and the Central Department of Geology, Tribhuvan University, studied the artefacts in Kwhlosothar.Bed Bahadur Gurung, a Gandaki provincial assembly member and former chairman of Madi rural municipality, said the trail has many historical and archaeological sites for pilgrimages for the Tamu [Gurung] people and could be an important historical attraction for Nepali and foreign trekkers.Kwhlosothar or Kohla Sothar is divided into three villages—lower, middle and upper. ‘Sothar’, in the Gurung language, means three villages. Locals and researchers say Kohla Sonthar resembles the 15th-century Inca ruins of Machu Pichu in Peru. For a long time, people have been demanding the area be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.“There are many historical artefacts, including houses and palaces, in these three villages,” said Gurung.There are caves after walking two hours more from Kwhlosothar at the height 3,800. ‘The cave is known as ‘Chamsyo Nagra.’Gurung remembers when his father brought salt via Tangting of Kwhlosothar-Namun Bhanjyang-Larke Pass-Tibet route five decades ago.When the road from Pokhara-Butwal opened, the people of Kwhlosothar stopped going along the mountainous route.No human settlement exists above Tangting, but many sheep and buffalo herders can be found there.Gurung said that before the Annapurna Conservation Area Project was established in 1985, foreign trekkers used to go for camping treks. However, since the project didn’t include the Kwhlosothar, trekkers stopped hiking in the area and remained isolated.The project promoted Manang, Lamjung, Thorong Pass, Mustanf, Myagfi and Annapurna Base Camp, Ghandruk-Ghorepani, but Kwhlosothar remained in the shadows.In Tony Hagen's book Building Bridges to the Third World: Memories of Nepal 1950-1992, the Swiss geologist mentions his travel experience to Namun Bhanjyang, from the base of Machapuchhre to Sikles, Madi River, and Krupudanda.The trail was named the ‘Tony Hagen Trail’ after Bed Bahadur Gurung became the chairman of the Madi rural municipality to promote it.“This trail needs to be redefined to allow people to know the historical importance of the place. The provincial and local governments and tourism entrepreneurs of Lamjung, Manang, and Kaski all need to play an equal role in promoting the area,” said Gurung.The Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment of Gandaki Province, Nepal Tourism Board office in Pokhara have been allocating a budget to promote trails in Madi in Kaski, Kwhlosothar of Lamjung and Chame of Manang. But on the promotional front, locals say nothing has been done.The Gurung Tourism Entrepreneurs Association has named the trekking route the Gurung Heritage Trail.“As trekking trails have been losing charm due to haphazard road construction, such trails are still untouched by modern development,” said Kisham Kumari Gurung, president of the association.“These trails can draw high-end trekkers, which can create jobs and increase the income of people in the areas,” said the president. “Gurung heritage trail has a combination of nature and culture.”Gurung heritage trekking trail has been developed from Tangting to Danda-Tapro-Kwhlosothar-Thulilek-Thurju-Dudh Pokhari-Gurung Deurali-Danfe Kharka-Timang to Besi Sahar, said Bobar Jung Gurung, founding president of the association. The association's members and others recently conducted a 10-day trekking trail exploration and promotion programme.The trekking trail includes Kwhlosothar (3,283 metres); Thulilek, a vast grazing area (4,070 metres); Dudh Pokhari, a religious place (4,585 metres); Namun Bhanjyang (5,560 metres); and Danfe Kharka, a yak grazing area (3,862 metres).The Annapurna Conservation Area Project and the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal coordinated the exploration. The trekking can be completed in 12 days.As a motor road has been reached to Ghandruk and Ghorepani of Annapurna Conservation Area, reducing the charm of trekking, the new trekking trail can be an alternative, said Deepak Sapkota, a member of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal, Gandaki.“In this area, we can revive camping trekking, which can be a big draw for trekkers.” \nAs the deadline to reduce 50 percent of existing deaths and disabilities from snakebites nears, herpetologists and public health experts emphasise the urgency for awareness and training for local health workers to meet this crucial health goal.They say that fatalities and disabilities from snakebites can be significantly reduced if vulnerable populations, especially children, women and farmers residing in rural areas, are made aware of the risks.“Along with the awareness, health workers serving at the local level should be trained to deal with snakebite cases,” said Dr Sanjib Kumar Sharma, rector at BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “Trained health workers can manage snakebite cases more effectively than others.”Snakebite, which kills hundreds of people every year, is a major public health scare in Nepal.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. Snakebite incidents are also common among cattle, and thousands of farmers are affected every year.The government has committed to reducing 50 percent of deaths and disabilities through snakebite envenomation by 2030, the national target aligned with the World Health Organisation’s ‘Snakebite Roadmap’.“The government has created a pool of doctors and experts for snakebite case management and master trainers,” said Sharma. “Along with other measures, authorities concerned should also focus on launching an awareness drive, which will make a huge difference in lessening overall snakebite incidents.”Moreover, along with awareness, identifying the snake will also be crucial for case management. Health workers ask the public to take photos of snakes if they are able to after they are bitten, which helps them identify the snake so that they can start treatment accordingly.“Archive of the photos of snakes available in the country should be maintained so that health workers could identify the snakes’ types and start treatment accordingly,” said Dr Sunita Ghimire, a molecular biologist. “Risk of deaths and disabilities increases due to inability to identify the snakes’ type.”Experts say authorities must also strengthen health infrastructures to achieve the target. They say due to poor infrastructure in healthcare facilities—lack of doctors, anti-snake venoms, ventilator support systems, and kidney dialysis facilities—dozens of people die from snakebite every year.While health facilities are ill-equipped and short on anti-snake venom, many people in rural areas lack awareness and often consult shamans instead of physicians.Doctors say women who go to the fields to collect fodder, farmers who do plantations or harvest, and children who play in open areas are more vulnerable to snakebite.Poor people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats, their fodder.Experts say there should be a greater awareness drive on keeping the houses and surroundings clean, preventing children from playing in the bushes and avoiding walking at night. If absolutely necessary, people must use torchlights while walking in the dark.Nepal imports polyvalent antivenom from India, which is effective against four common species of snakes found in India: the common cobra, common krait, saw-scaled viper, and Russell’s viper. Saw-scaled viper has not yet been found in the country.Deaths from pit viper bites in the hills and mountainous regions have also risen recently. However, the antivenom made for other venomous snakes does not treat pit viper’s case. \nAt least 23 died, including one in Kathmandu Valley, and over 80 people have been infected with the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since June this year.The number of reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as tests were carried out only on those hospitalised patients after their conditions got severe, officials say.“The death rate from the Japanese encephalitis infection is the highest among the vaccine-preventable diseases,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division. “Relevant health agencies have been taking all necessary measures to prevent infection and deaths from the virus.”Cases of the deadly viral disease have been reported in 30 districts of six provinces except Karnali. What concerns health officials is the death rate rising alarmingly every year—around 29 percent in the current fiscal year. Fatality among children under 15 years is very high while complications from JE infection could cause permanent injuries to the brain and the nervous system.Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection, endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organisation, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to a half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Data from the health ministry show that less than 50 percent of the infected patients were found inoculated with the vaccine. Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines have been developed to prevent infection. Health officials, however, said that their attempts to convince development partners, including the World Health Organisation, for a mass JE vaccination campaign have not succeeded.“We have raised the issue several times with officials from the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation and requested their support,” said Lal. “But as of now, none of the agencies is convinced to support JE vaccination. Either the government has to decide and secure the funding source, or the aid agency should invest in the JE vaccination.”The National Immunisation Advisory Committee, an expert panel, has also not recommended mass JE vaccination despite the high mortality rate.“Vaccine does not help in controlling the ongoing epidemic,” said Dr Ramesh Kanta Adhikari, senior immunisation expert and a National Immunisation Advisory Committee member. “We are ready to carry out a feasibility study, hold review meetings and discussions with the concerned experts and stakeholders to recommend the JE vaccination campaign if the government decides the same.”In 2005, JE killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the Tarai districts. Nepal started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organisation officially issued prequalification certification, due to high rates of infection and deaths from the virus at the time.In the first phase, all populations of the highly affected four districts—Banke, Bardiya, Dang, and Kailali—were given the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into routine immunisation in 2015. Even then, people still die, and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.The Ministry of Health and Population said its attention has been drawn to the spread of a deadly virus that has killed around two dozen people and infected scores of others.“I have called a meeting of the officials concerned from the Family Welfare Division to discuss the issue on Friday,” said Pradip Paudel, minister for health and population. “We have taken the issue seriously and will make some decisions to prevent deaths and infections from the JE virus.”Public health experts say this is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk. Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity against future infections. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise avoiding mosquito bites, such as by using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or travels to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal. \nA team of senior health officials from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, who were deployed recently in Gandaki Province to assess the latest situation of the dengue spread, returned with complaints. Along with health workers serving at local bodies and provincial hospitals, elected representatives and local leaders of political parties, with whom they discussed, complained about exorbitant testing charges at private laboratories.“We are aware of the excessive prices being charged by private labs for dengue testing and held discussions about setting a maximum price but couldn't reach a decision,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “For the next dengue season, we would make a decision about slashing the testing charges.”Nepal has been witnessing a rapid surge in new cases of dengue infection in recent months. Health authorities, however, do not concede that the number of new dengue cases is rising alarmingly. Doctors say there could be dengue patients in almost all households, especially in the Kathmandu Valley and in major cities like Pokhara.Officials say that state-run health facilities do not charge for dengue testing, and they are aware of excessive charging by private labs despite the significant decline in the cost of rapid diagnostic test kits.“It cost less than 100 rupees for a rapid diagnostic testing kit, but private labs have been charging excessively,” an official at the Department of Health Services said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “Due to a lack of regulation, private labs and hospitals have been fleecing patients, and health officials have been avoiding making decisions to appease the private laboratories and hospitals.”Public health experts say that it was obvious for patients to bear brunt when the authorities concerned, including the health minister, focus on gaining popularity by announcing populist programmes that are not feasible to implement with existing resources.“Some hospitals have been charging up to Rs 3,000 for dengue tests,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “When the authorities forget their prime duties and fear antogonising private hospitals and labs, it is inevitable that patients will suffer.”Most state run health facilities and labs remained closed during Tihar holidays, which forced infected patients to seek services at private hospitals. Meanwhile, the Department of Health Services said that its attention has been drawn to the excessive charging for dengue testing at private labs.“I have noted the issue and will discuss it with the Health Ministry,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We will make some decisions regarding this issue.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.So far, only 12 people have died, and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often concealed the actual number of deaths and infections.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nIn rural Madhesh, where cultural norms and limited access to healthcare compound an already fragile health infrastructure, women’s sexual and reproductive health needs are often sidelined.For many women there, awareness of their own bodies and health needs remains a distant reality. Seeking help for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues is often a last resort.Seema Kumari Pasman, a 20-year-old from Karmahi village in Dhanusha who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy, is one such example.Married at 16 in 2019, she quickly became a mother of two children by 2022.After two child births, her menstrual complications worsened, yet she had no frame of reference to understand that what she was experiencing—menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding—was a medical condition.Pasman endured a year of painful, prolonged periods that she had been taught were simply part of a woman’s life—a burden, not a condition needing treatment.Daily chores became unbearable for her but those around her continued to dismiss her symptoms.One night in December 2023, after collapsing while fetching water from a hand pump, Pasman’s family rushed her to Janakpur Provincial Hospital.There, doctors diagnosed her with severe anaemia from untreated menorrhagia. “The doctors told me that if I had received earlier intervention, my suffering could have been prevented...but I only thought it was normal,” Pasman says.The culture of silence around SRH issues means that women like Pasman get help only when their conditions are critical.A 2018 study in the Journal of Health and Allied Sciences reported low awareness of SRH rights among 384 married Madheshi women in Sarlahi. Three-fifths were unaware of these rights, and the same proportion reported experiences of physical and dowry-related violence.Chandra Rekha Issar, a gynaecologist at Janakpur Provincial Hospital and assistant professor at the Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences (MIHS), says that for many women, the concept of openly talking about SRH—especially with male doctors—is almost unthinkable.In rural Madhesh, as part of ‘ghunghat pratha’, married women have limited interaction with unrelated men outside their family. They are often expected to wear a veil in front of everyone except their husbands and rarely go outside alone for extended periods.This restrictive environment creates a hesitation among women to discuss their SRH. When these women visit a gynaecologist and are assigned a male doctor, it often leads to discomfort.Health consultations can thus become uncomfortable or are avoided altogether, exacerbating a pattern of undiagnosed and untreated conditions.At Janakpur Hospital, this cultural barrier plays out every single day.Kamala Devi Mandal, a 30-year-old woman from Khariyani, Janakpur, sat clutching her veil in the waiting area of the Department of Gynaecology, with her mother in law on the side.When her turn came, Mandal hesitated upon seeing a male gynaecologist, Raj Kishor Pandit, at the door. Despite a female attendant’s presence, Mandal’s mother-in-law ultimately did the talking, while Kamala remained silent, visibly uncomfortable.For Issar, these hesitations are all too familiar. She works alongside male gynaecologists in a department where only four of the 13 doctors are female.“In a setting where women are uncomfortable speaking about reproductive issues, especially with male doctors, we have to proceed carefully, often through the person accompanying the patient,” she says.Most of the female patients are accompanied by family members, as husbands are often working abroad.For something as basic as the date of their last menstrual cycle, the patient often defers to the person accompanying her. “Most of them are under a veil,” Issar added, “and removing it, even for an eye check to assess anaemia, takes coaxing… It requires long counselling for women to open up. At times, the information we receive is incomplete, which creates challenges in treatment.”If patients still hesitate to see a male gynaecologist after counselling, a female gynaecologist is assigned when possible, says Issar. However, this is often unfeasible during busy hours due to limited staff compared to the high patient load.Gynecologist Issar says that about 85 percent of the hospital’s gynaecology and obstetrics cases involve pregnancy-related complications, often worsened by malnutrition, lack of prenatal care, and early marriages.General gynaecology accounts for 15 percent of patients, with menstrual issues like dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding common among adolescents under 19, while older patients face infections, cervical cancer, and uterine prolapse.Due to early marriages, multiple childbirths, and home deliveries without medical supervision, many women develop uterine prolapse—a condition typically seen in older women but increasingly common in those as young as 30 in rural Madhesh.The gendered expectations that govern interactions in rural Madhesh leave women ill-equipped to advocate for their health.“During a health camp in Saptari, I found that over ten percent of women under 35 had uterine prolapse,” Issar says. “Early marriage and childbirth in an environment without health education or postnatal care have serious consequences.”The barriers also include outdated beliefs and superstitions which affect women’s diet and recovery after childbirth.“Although the situation has improved, women in remote Madhesh are often prohibited from consuming protein-rich foods like chicken soup or meat after giving birth,” says 24 year old Sapana Ray, a bachelor’s student in public health at Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences. “They are typically allowed only one meal of roti and are discouraged from more water and meal, as it’s believed that this prevents colds and other illnesses in the child,” Ray added, “This lack of nutrition contributes to malnutrition and anaemia, exacerbating their health issues.”When rural women lack basic health literacy, common gynaecological issues go unchecked, leading to preventable complications. For instance, over 80 percent of cases at Janakpur Provincial Hospital are critical.“Most of these severe cases could have been prevented with early intervention or just an understanding of basic health,” Issar says.As Issar sees it, comprehensive awareness campaigns are crucial for educating women about sexual and reproductive health.“The government should consider monthly outreach programmes in rural areas. Women in far rural communities need direct, consistent health education,” Issar says. Further, local health posts with trained personnel could provide preventive care and answer questions women may hesitate to bring up in a hospital setting.The hospital’s efforts to include female attendants in male doctors’ consultations and to counsel women on gender-neutral healthcare only go so far. Often, patients’ deep-seated fears and hesitation prove challenging to overcome.While Madhesh’s women struggle with silence and a lack of resources, healthcare professionals are left piecing together fragmented stories, trying to heal patients who are often reluctant to share their suffering. It is a race against time and tradition.Dr Issar says that it’s unfair to blame women for hesitating to discuss their issues with gynaecologists. “We need to understand and empathise with their background,” she says.Many women, living in conservative settings, rarely have the freedom to speak openly. Given this, she questions, “How can we expect them to feel fully comfortable discussing their sexual and reproductive health, especially with a male doctor?” Even for educated urban women, she adds, these conversations can be challenging.According to Ray, consistent ground-level awareness and counselling programmes on SRH are essential, alongside changes to the conservative and predominantly patriarchal settings in rural areas. “These social barriers, even more than medical intervention, are often the primary obstacles to healthcare access for women in these communities,” she says. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal’s hopes to qualify for the ICC U-19 Women’s T20 World Cup suffered a huge setback after they lost their Asia Qualifier match to hosts United Arab Emirates by 13 runs at the Sevens Stadium in Ajman, the UAE on Saturday.The loss puts Nepal two points below the hosts, who have maintained their unbeaten streak in the competition and sit in the summit of the four-team group with six points from three matches.The top-placed finishers at the end of the double round-robin league will advance to the 2025 ICC U-19 Women’s T20 World Cup, which is set to take place in Malaysia.It means Nepal’s dream to play their maiden U-19 Women’s World Cup is not over yet.Nepal’s defeat gives the UAE—who are looking to reach their second World Cup after debuting in the main event in 2023 in South Africa—an edge in the race but Puja Mahato’s side will need extra effort in their remaining fixtures, particularly against the UAE when the two sides meet again on November 13 in the second round of the competition.Nepal gave the UAE early scare dismissing opener Emily Thomas for a duck, trapped lbw by Mahato, in the first over and Samaira Dharnidharka for eight in the fourth, caught by Rachanna Chaudhary off Krishma Gurung.Thomas’s opening partner Lavanya Keny and Rinitha Rajith rebuilt the innings taking the UAE past 75 but Riya Sharma broke their stand when she caught and bowled the former for 20 in the 12th over.Rajith continued the resistance to drag the UAE close to the 100-run mark before Seema KC dismissed her in 14.1 overs. Rajith departed with 33-ball 48 which would prove crucial in their defence of the 122 total.Sharma was the pick of Nepal’s bowling with 3-15.Nepal started the chase at a slow pace as they lost opener Sabitri Dhami for six and were at 39-2 halfway into the innings when Sana Praveen fell to Mekak Thakur in the 9.3 overs.Puja Mahato rekindled Nepal’s hopes with 48 and took her side past 100 total with some support from Sony Pakhrin (19) and Jyotsnika Marasini (11 not out).But Indhuja Nandakumar put a break to Nepal’s march removing Mahato in the 18.4 overs.The target was still achievable with 20 more needed from eight balls but Nepal fell short in the final push. \nIndia opener Sanju Samson scored a sparkling century as the tourists beat South Africa by 61 runs in the first match of a four-game Twenty20 series in Durban on Friday.South Africa asked India to bat and the visitors posted 202 for eight in their 20 overs, before restricting their hosts to 141 all out in 17.5 overs for a comprehensive victory.India’s total was boosted by a brilliant 107 from 50 balls by Samson but the innings did stall towards the end.Samson smashed 10 sixes and seven fours as he tore into the bowling at the small Kingsmead ground. He rattled along at a strike rate of 214, providing more than half his team’s total.“The amount of hard work he (Samson) has put in over the last few years, doing those boring things again and again, he is reaping the fruits (now),” India captain Suryakumar Yadav said.“He is putting the team first, even when he was in the 90s he was looking to hit fours and sixes. That’s what separates him.”At 167-2 in the 15th over, India looked on course for a score well in excess of 200, but managed only another 35 runs in 32 balls for the loss of six wickets after Tilak Varma was dismissed for 33.Seamers Marco Jansen (1-24 in four overs) and Gerald Coetzee (3-37) were the pick of the home attack.India’s legbreak bowlers stifled the South African reply as their innings never managed to gain momentum.Varun Chakravarthy took 3-25 as he picked up the key wickets of Heinrich Klaasen (25) and David Miller (18), while Ravi Bishnoi recorded figures of 3-28.“We wanted to get off to a better start (with the bat) and that’s where we lost the game,” South Africa captain Aiden Markram said.“Sanju played incredibly well, put our bowlers under pressure. When a guy is striking like that, it is pretty hard to stop him and you have to take your hat off.”The second match of the series will be played in Gqeberha on Sunday. \nNepal will kick off their 2024 ACC U-19 Men’s Asia Cup against Sri Lanka on November 29.The U-19 Asia Cup is scheduled to take place from November 29 to December 8 in the United Arab Emirates.Nepal have been drawn alongside defending champions Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan in Group B. India, Pakistan, hosts UAE and Japan are in Group A.Nepal next play their group match of the 50-over tournament against Bangladesh on December 1 before facing Afghanistan two days later.The group winners and runners-up from each group will progress into the semi-finals, which will take place on December 6. The final will be held on December 8.Holders Bangladesh won their maiden U-19 Asia Cup title in December last year, defeating the UAE by 195 runs in the final.Nepal U-19 men’s team, who qualified to the Asia Cup as the champions of the ACC Men’s U-19 Premier Cup, are making their ninth straight appearance in the Asia Cup. However, they have made it past the group stage only once, in 2017, when they finished in the second position and above India in their group. That Nepal’s U-19 squad included the likes of current national team members and star cricketers Dipendra Singh Airee, Sandeep Lamichhane, Aasif Sheikh, Anil Sah and Rohit Paudel and also beat India on the way to the last four, which they lost to Afghanistan by seven wickets.UAE and Japan qualified to the Asia Cup as Premier Cup runners-up and third placed team.Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka got direct berths to the Asia Cup as full member nations. \nQatar will stop trying to mediate a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal until Hamas and Israel show a “sincere willingness” to return to the negotiating table, an official briefed on the matter told Reuters on Saturday, in the biggest setback to efforts to reach a truce since the war began.The small but influential Gulf country has also concluded that Hamas’ political office in Doha “no longer serves its purpose”, the official added, in a further blow to the Palestinian militant group whose top leaders have been assassinated by Israel.Qatar, alongside the United States and Egypt, has played a major role in rounds of so-far fruitless talks to broker a ceasefire to the year-long war in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages Hamas is holding in the enclave. The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal.“The Qataris have said since the start of the conflict that they can only mediate when both parties demonstrate a genuine interest in finding a resolution,” the official said.Qatar has not set a deadline for Hamas’ political office to close or for Hamas leaders to leave Qatar and it was unclear if the move could be reversed.Qatar informed Hamas, Israel and the US administration that it would be willing to resume its negotiating role if Hamas and Israel “demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiation table with the objective of putting an end to the war,” the official said.There was no official response from Hamas.A Palestinian official close to the mediation talks said: “Hamas may not comment unless it is informed officially by Qatar. So far it is media talk.”Washington had told Qatar that Hamas’ presence in Doha was no longer acceptable in the weeks since the group rejected the latest proposal to achieve a ceasefire and a hostage deal, a US official said on Friday.Qatar's government reconsidered Hamas’ presence in the country in April, which the official said prompted the group's leaders to leave for Turkey.“After two weeks, the Biden administration and the Israeli government asked Qatar to request their return,” the official said, adding that Washington has said negotiations were ineffective when the Hamas leaders were in Turkey.Qatar, designated as a major non-NATO ally by Washington, has hosted Hamas' political leaders since 2012 as part of an agreement with the US.It is unclear how many Hamas officials live in Doha, but they include several touted as possible replacements for leader Yahya Sinwar, whom Israeli forces killed in Gaza last month, including Sinwar’s deputy Khalil al-Hayya, who has led ceasefire negotiations for the group, and Khaled Meshaal, widely seen as Hamas' diplomatic face.The group’s previous leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Iran in July almost certainly by Israel, was also based in Doha. His body was flown to Qatar for burial in early August. \nAt least 24 people were killed and more than 40 injured in a bomb blast on Saturday at a railway station in the city of Quetta in southwestern Pakistan, police and other officials said.Quetta is the capital of Balochistan province, which is grappling with a surge in strikes by separatist ethnic militants that has raised security concerns for projects aiming to develop the province’s untapped mineral resources.Inspector general of police for Balochistan Mouzzam Jah Ansari said 24 people have died so far from the blast at the railway station, which is usually busy early in the day when the explosion took place.“The target was army personnel from the Infantry School,” he said, with many of the injured in critical condition. Quetta Commissioner Hamza Shafqat said 16 soldiers were among the dead.The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement emailed to Reuters.The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan, a province of about 15 million people that borders Afghanistan to the north and Iran to the west. The BLA is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups battling the government, saying it unfairly exploits the province's rich gas and mineral resources.“So far 44 injured people have been brought to civil hospital,” Wasim Baig, a hospital spokesperson, told Reuters.Senior superintendent of police operations, Muhammad Baloch, said the blast seemed to be a suicide bomb and that investigations were underway for more information.“The blast took place inside the railway station when the Peshawar-bound express was about to leave for its destination,” Baloch said.In August, at least 73 people were killed in Balochistan after separatist militants attacked police stations, railway lines, and highways.The assaults in August were the most widespread in years by militants fighting a decades-long insurgency to win secession for the province, home to major China-led projects such as a port and a gold and copper mine. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nIn 1932, Juddha Shumsher Rana's Jawalakhel Zoological Garden housed various animals, including tigers, rhinos, hippos, red pandas, and a lion, which were primarily kept for his entertainment and amusement with limited public access.\nUpon becoming President, Masoud Pezeshkian appointed Abbas Araghchi as Foreign Minister, aiming to improve Iran's relations with the West while facing challenges from neighboring countries and Israeli attacks in Gaza and Lebanon, leading to a delicate balancing act between national security and diplomatic outreach.\nDespite major obstacles, including criminal convictions, assassination attempts, and political opposition, Donald Trump's focus on economic concerns and the perceived failure of his opponent Kamala Harris resonated with voters, leading to his victory in the US presidential election, showcasing the irrational nature of voters and the allure of simple emotional appeals in an era of social media and widespread dissatisfaction.\nDespite announcing ambitious free healthcare initiatives, Nepal's healthcare system lacks resources and funding, raising concerns about the feasibility and potential negative impacts of such programs.\nKathmandu, Nepal will establish a consumer court to address widespread market malpractices, including low-quality goods and price manipulation.\nFrequent plane crashes, natural disasters, poor infrastructure and bureaucratic challenges—they all ail Nepali tourism. There is a dire need to ramp up efforts to get it on track. But then we as a country are taking a step back when the rest of the world is looking to boost tourism with robust plans and policies. The Civil Aviation Authority’s latest decision to close Tribhuvan International Airport—Nepal’s only ariel gateway for foreign tourists and the sole door of opportunities for millions of its citizens—for 10 hours (10 pm to 8 am) to complete a long-overdue taxiway expansion, has garnered national and international criticism for the strain it will put on the country’s tourism.While there is nothing wrong with the project to renovate taxiways that have worn out from years of use, the authorities perhaps didn’t consider its impact on tourism and passengers seriously. The airport closure from November 8 to March 31 is bound to inconvenience foreign visitors as it coincides with both autumn and spring peak trekking seasons. Festivals, family reunions, holidays and favourable weather make this season the perfect time to travel to Nepal. Such a prolonged halt will only dampen people’s enthusiasm. One is left wondering why such a vital time was chosen for these renovations.The financial repercussions are substantial. The Nepal Tourism Board, which had aimed for 1.3 million tourists this year, has cut down the expected number to 1.1 million. This could lead to a revenue loss of around Rs50 billion for the airline and tourism industry. Indirect cost could be many times higher. International airlines have cut flights or cancelled tickets at short notice, taking airfares to all-time highs. For instance, the most popular destination in November, Sydney, which would have cost Rs85,000 on normal days, will now cost Rs217,000 (for the highest priced tickets) and Rs114,000 (lowest). For average Nepali workers and students, these fares are unaffordable. Tourism entrepreneurs are facing losses as hotels are reporting cancellations.In 2019, for the same project, the airport was closed for seven hours (11:30 pm to 6:30 am) after which 24/7 operations began for the first time to compensate for the lost flight hours. Earlier this year, too, for the very project, landings from the northern side of the airport were barred, but there were no airport closures. Given these precedents, one would have expected more robust planning this time. Instead, it seems there has not been enough homework. The civil aviation authorities’ efforts to manage the Kathmandu airport’s congestion by redirecting traffic to Pokhara and Gautam Buddha international airports have also failed because no foreign airline operator is willing to fly to these destinations. Travel trade entrepreneurs lament that this “unplanned construction” is taking too long and fear it might extend to spring, another peak tourist season. This is understandable given Nepal’s poor record in completing roads and infrastructure. They have also urged the authorities to limit the shutdown to five hours. However, that risks further delaying the project. A balanced approach that prioritises tourism and passengers while ensuring timely completion is the best. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) request that the authorities shorten the closure or spare high-traffic days is logical. Halting operations at peak arrival and departure is neither wise nor sustainable. Ultimately, the health of the country’s civil aviation is closely linked to the state of its regulator. Right now, it appears that our top aviation officials are working more for themselves than for the benefit of the intended beneficiaries.  \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nOn Saturday the weather in Koshi, Gandaki, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province along with the hilly regions of the country is forecast to be partly cloudy while the rest of the country is to remain partly cloudy to mainly fair.Light rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of the hilly regions of Koshi, Gandaki, Karnali, and Sudur Pashchim Province and at one or two places in the hilly regions of the rest of the province.Tonight the weather will be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of the country and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the Province.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepalese manufacturers and exporters face challenges trading with India due to restrictive measures and the Indian government's silence on BIS certification, halting exports of sanitary pads, diapers, shoes, cement, plywood, and other goods.\nNepal's Prime Minister Oli's upcoming China visit will focus on implementing past agreements, with Nepal seeking to convert a Pokhara Airport loan to a grant and sign a Belt and Road Initiative implementation plan.\nParliamentary committees remain inactive, despite Speaker's plea and commitments from major parties, leaving the winter session of federal parliament potentially without adequate business.\nNepal's Ministry of Health hires 36 nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding, which has declined from 70% in 2011 to 56% in 2021, with bottle-feeding more prevalent in urban areas, higher maternal education, and higher wealth quintiles.\nNepal announces 18-man squad for ACC U-19 Asia Cup, captained by Dhami, set to compete in group B against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan from November 29 to December 8.\nEighteen Nepalis trafficked through multiple countries to reach Bulgaria were arrested three months ago for entering without valid documents. The Nepali Embassy in Germany, which provides consular support to Nepalis in Bulgaria, confirmed that the Nepalis were detained on charges of illegal entry.The Bulgarian authorities are preparing to deport the detainees this week. They are currently held at a deportation centre in the capital city, Sofia. “There are 18 of us here, waiting for travel documents,” one detainee said. “We hope to be repatriated soon.” The detainee added that none of them have passports. “The Bulgarian authorities have contacted the Nepali Embassy to arrange travel documents for our return.”Sagar Prasad Phuyal, the deputy chief of mission at the Nepali Embassy in Germany, confirmed the embassy’s coordination with Bulgarian authorities to expedite the deportation process. “We have issued the necessary travel documents,” Phuyal said. “The Bulgarian government will cover their travel costs to Nepal, and they are expected to be deported by next week.”The detainees reportedly travelled from India to Romania, then Hungary, and finally Bulgaria, with many initially arriving in Romania on work permits. Of late, there are some reports of instances of some Nepalis abandoning their legal work status in Romania and attempting to reach other European countries.“I was planning to go to Poland,” said one detainee. “I had a three-month Bulgarian visa, but it expired, and I was arrested. Returning to Nepal is now the only option left.” \nSome serious newspapers have raised a crucial question recently—why is the Nepali response to the current atrocities of war so scant? This inquisition has an element of sarcasm: Are we not sensitive enough about world events? However, the main concern is about the silence of the Nepalis or the Nepali press on the colossus suffering of men, women and children caused by indiscriminate bombings and shootings that are reported every day. Given that the scale of suffering and physical assaults has surpassed all known limits, this concern is natural. “The scenes may be disturbing” has become the common warning of news anchors, a constant admonition of the apocalypse, as it were. It seems we live in a time when visuals of disaster jostle to take space in our system of understanding the world. Among the horrific events that are common are the wars and killings in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan, to name a few. Besides these, more incidents are happening that assail our sensibilities. The common pattern of suffering and atrocities is uncanny. Lethal bombs fall on peaceful cities and suburbs, hospitals and schools. Never before have such insensitivities showing children crawling out of the rubble, crying in horror and women mourning their dear ones, been reported or recorded as today. I recall one literary event organised by the institution of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) literary writers, held from December 3-6, 2023, in Delhi. The theme of the conference was “Anguish over Senseless Wars.” I want to cite from my article, published in this newspaper under the title of the above-mentioned theme, about the writers’ protest against war: “The anguish felt by the writers about wars, especially the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Gaza wars, truly reflect literary writers’ concern. Non-partisan humanists, creators and advocates of peace and welfare, the writers get hurt more than the others by the colossal loss of lives, including children, in these and other senseless wars. All artists are touched by wars that are truly senseless. There are many instances of writers’ opposition to the wars. But they have paid heavily for such gestures. There is a history of banning books written against wars and other atrocities. In several places today, the voices of writers are drowned; they are even persecuted.” (The Kathmandu Post, December 24, 2023). The general complaint is that Nepali response to world events is not commonly featured in our media, nor does it occupy a space of importance in serious academic discussions. Maybe we must first look at our response to wars and atrocities in history. The Nepali youths, perhaps more than many others in Asia, have encountered and experienced the effects of world events, including wars, with personal involvement, physical loss of lives, and suffering. Researchers have discovered the songs composed by these youths who fought in the First World War as British soldiers. As an example, I would like to mention the research works of Alaka Atreya Chudal, a Vienna University teacher. Several such works record the experience of the Nepali youths who fought in the Second World War. That spectre of history continues to haunt and attract the Nepali youths today. I have no space to mention them here. What it shows is that the Nepali response to world events in history had a subjective and existential character. This subject needs a different treatment. Experiencing the effect of world events differs from looking at the incidents and making objective assessments. But it is natural for us to question today or at any other time about the scanty response to the current horrid events in our political expressions and the media. One Nepali youth, Bipin Joshi, was kidnapped by Hamas in the October 7 attack last year. The complaint is that the killings of civilians in the punitive attacks are not sufficiently reported and that people have not expressed their views on the events. But my impression is that we have responded well to these events. Nepali print and visual media are reporting the events regularly. The other quality of the world events is their diffused and confusing nature. Over the years, the events around the world did not have any recognisable nature. Covid-19 was a crisis that evoked the diverse responses of various world leaders, and the problems became serious after that. World events have had devastating effects on people's minds. In the words of Gordon Brown, Britain's former prime minister, “The world is on fire. At no time since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 has the world looked so dangerous, nor has an end to its 56 conflicts—the highest number since the Second World War—seemed so distant and so difficult to achieve.\" (The Guardian, April 12, 2024). That remoteness and staggering number of events make it difficult for any media or individuals in Nepal to respond to the events. Our response is politically and emotionally oriented, a recognisable pattern in the world today. But the conditions that generate world events go beyond the control of those responsible for them. The rise of certain individuals to power with global effects and the temptation to invade others’ territories and kill innocent people indiscriminately appear to shape the patterns of current events. Nepalis who have their own way of dealing with the world do respond. Their expression is shaped by their political ideologies or sheer humanitarian concerns. And that is happening. There is no space to cite examples here. It is natural for the media to allude to this subject and be surprised at Nepali media’s sparse response to people’s sufferings in all the “senseless wars”. We can question the causes of such a limited response to the terrible suffering of people in the wars. One reason is the emergence of a very boisterous and acrimonious political culture in Nepal, with political groups, media and the public spending most of their time on it. I would not call it solipsism, but this is certainly a subject of concern. Developing a comprehensive vision is the answer.  \nThe American fate has been sealed. Donald Trump has been elected the 47th President of the United States. If his victory in 2016 was more than just a fluke, it is convincing and comprehensive this time. This is what the common Americans want, and the rest of the world will have to live with it, just like the supporters of his Demoractic rival, Kamala Harris, who are still in shock.We can discuss what Trump’s re-election means for the rest of the world and this region, but let us first take a longer detour to understand what is brewing inside the world’s largest democracy.American nightmareIn the first week of March 2024, The New York Times published a report based on their telephone survey of around 980 registered voters, where they interviewed each participant about their perception of the two US presidential candidates. The survey, conducted in collaboration with Siena College in New York, showed that Trump had the support of 44 percent of the prospective voters, compared to 38 percent who favoured then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden. The survey results were significant, considering Trump's exit in 2020 as one of the most disliked presidents in US history, with multiple criminal charges against him. More significantly, only a quarter of the respondents thought the country was on the right track, and around 50 percent believed that the Biden administration’s policies had personally hurt them. A few weeks before the polls, the survey team returned to the seven states, known as the battleground states, to understand the voting behaviour of roughly 7879 likely voters. Close to 90 percent of the participants were certain they would vote, but interestingly, 62 percent were undecided or refused to discuss their voting preference. The question then is, why were television channels and political pundits predicting Harris’s victory when the data and survey polls were far from conclusive? The answer is a bitter pill that analysts and panellists, engaged in an unenviable job of predicting elections, have difficulty swallowing. The world is unfair, and people usually make choices that benefit them personally. From our own electoral experiences, in a developing or developed country, in a highly progressive democracy or a flawed one, we have learned the hard way not to take the voters for granted. Common voters—unlike a party worker, an academic or a self-styled activist, can be individualists who think only about what the candidate has to offer and how their policies affect their lives. They are not always burdened by the higher morals of society, nor are they too concerned about events that don’t directly impact their lives. This is especially true if the voters believe their interests are being put at stake by their representatives in the name of a larger public good. This is at the heart of the majoritarian conservatism that is leading the world into a democratic back-sliding. For millions of people of colour, including Asian Americans, who migrated to the US in the 80s and the 90s, the American dream from Hollywood movies became a reality when the US government adopted a diversity policy to fulfil its skilled manpower needs. There is every reason to believe this policy boosted the US economy and projected the country as the land of democracy and dreams for minorities. But what did it do to the mindset of the majority of white Americans, including the working middle-class population? We do not know, do we? The nationalist rhetoric, often spewing hate against immigrants of different colour and races, did not gain strong support among a large section in a day or a decade. My own experience of writing and talking about the political inclusion of minorities has taught me spending too much time talking in an eco-chamber can blind-sight you from the reality unfolding right before your eyes. The sooner intellectuals and activists in the US understand this, the more they will be invested and interested in understanding the insecurities that have haunted their majority population. After all, the economic and environmental shocks the world has been facing since the last few decades have affected us all, irrespective of race, gender or ethnicity.The global aftershocks If Trump’s re-election has sent shockwaves within the US, its aftershocks will be felt across different continents. His final months of the campaign focused on convincing the Americans that the Biden-Harris administration was bleeding the US economy by fighting proxy wars and that he would get both Putin and Netanyahu to end the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. It will take more than two months for Trump to assume office at the White House and another month for his administration to be in order. Any chances of direct talks with Russia and Israel, if at all, are a few months away. In the Indo-Pacific region, Trump will most likely continue on the course set by the previous administration. Given the global economic crisis that has had far-reaching consequences for both the Chinese and the American economies, Beijing and Washington have agreed to a gradual de-escalation in the Indo-Pacific. Any radical departure from this course will hurt both superpowers and push the global economy into another meltdown. The de-escalation between the nuclear powers will also benefit smaller South Asian states caught in a difficult big-power rivalry. A parallel development in this regard is the US’s relationship with India, which has been strained by the alleged involvement of Indian diplomats in espionage and attempted assassination on US soil. Similar allegations by Canada have resulted in a severe diplomatic fallout with New Delhi. It is unclear how the incoming Trump administration will react to these developments, especially when there is pre-existing discontent over New Delhi’s close ties with the Russians while continuing its security alliance with the US in the Indo-Pacific. If the recent Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) summit in Russia is of any consequence, Washington will need more than just a fleeting interest in the region to fix things with New Delhi. But is Trump ready to ride the high tides in the Indo-Pacific just yet? The president of the US is the world’s most powerful executive, commanding the largest economy and military. So, Trump's re-election as president is one of the most significant political developments of this decade. While Trump’s position concerning the climate crisis and human rights is deeply concerning, the global community will be more interested in his efforts to restore peace in war-ravaged Europe and the Middle East. On the domestic issues, however, we can only say: God bless America! \nFollowing 9/11, the ashes of the World Trade Centre in New York ignited fires in different parts of the world. Even now, 23 years later, those fires are proving difficult to extinguish. The so-called War on Terror (WoT), much like the Cold War, has been an expansive war, which has directly or indirectly affected almost every nation. It would, therefore, be of interest to examine their similarities and differences.The term ‘Cold War’ was first used by George Orwell, the nom de plume of Eric Arthur Blair, in an article in 1945. The war itself commenced with the announcement of the Truman Doctrine in 1947 and concluded with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The WoT started about 10 years later, in 2001. The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in 2021 was celebrated as the end of the WoT. However, post-withdrawal developments proved that the WoT had merely entered a new phase. The US may have physically withdrawn from the theatre, but its strategic interests remained intact. Even today, the great powers and major terrorist groups do not know when the WoT will end.While the Cold War was between two blocs, with other states taking a side, the ongoing WoT was supposed to be between nation-states and violent non-state actors. In reality, some states did provide space, finances, and ideological and diplomatic support to violent non-state actors; otherwise, it would be difficult for the latter to survive.Therefore, though terrorist groups were also active during the Cold War, the post-9/11 era saw a mushroom growth in their numbers. Al Qaeda was established much before the WoT, but it spawned and inspired a number of extremist groups thereafter. The WoT not only impacted the sovereignty of states but also the territorial integrity of a few. Countries like Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and Afghanistan faced instability and were confronted with civil war-like situations.The Cold War was primarily an ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism; the WoT was about combating terrorism based on a struggle against extremist ideologies. The Cold War and WoT both influenced international relations, with alliances shaping geopolitics. The Cold War saw Soviet expansion, with the capitalist bloc trying to contain it. For some analysts, the Cold War was a smokescreen for the US to influence and control events in Western Europe and Japan. On the other hand, the WoT remained largely focused on specific regions, particularly in the Middle East. The Cold War spawned a nuclear race and indirect military engagements, while the WoT saw direct and prolonged military engagements, as seen in Afghanistan and Iraq.To recognise its strategic partners in 1987, the US designated Major Non-Nato Ally (MNNA) status to various countries.MNNAs are not members of Nato but are entitled to certain benefits in military cooperation. Out of the 20 countries with MNNA status, eight received it before 9/11, while 12 countries obtained this status in the post-9/11 era. This highlights how the US grew its military influence around the world following the WoT.The WoT is not restricted to national borders and involves many countries and international coalitions. The WoT often involves state actors combating non-state actors and has therefore influenced security legislation and policies such as the US’s Patriot Act, which extended surveillance and law-enforcement powers within the world’s most powerful nation as well. The WoT also brou­ght with it human rights concerns, es­­pe­cially about tortu­­re, detentions (for example, Guan­tá­namo Bay) and targeted killings via drones.During the initial phase of the WoT, religious ext­remism, ethnic di­­vides, and political marginalisa­­t-ion fur­ther comp-lica­t­­ed the milit­a­ncy la­­ndscape. The WoT gained impetus from globalisat­ion, technological innovations, the openness of media and the stren­gth of social media, which triggered rights and peace movements on the one hand, while enabling the speedy dissemination of hate material and fake news on the other.States with weak economies cannot completely isolate themselves as either parties or victims of violent conflicts. The survival and effectiveness of states require a greater focus on countering violent narratives, which is not possible without investing in social empowerment and improving public service delivery.Terrorism is a transnational phenomenon. There is a need for an increased realisation that terrorism and conflicts benefit only a few powerful entities, while the rest pay the costs. For powerful states and violent non-state actors, terrorism is a commercial enterprise and a source of power, pleasure, and profit. The truth is that sole reliance on military might is not an antidote.—Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nPeople in 71 local units across 20 districts in Nepal were affected by rain-induced disasters in the last week of September. Landslides and floods triggered by incessant rains resulted in massive loss of human lives and infrastructure in Bagmati Province, including the Kathmandu Valley, as well as in the hilly districts of Koshi Province. Over 250 people died as several settlements were swept away. Altogether, around 391 people were killed nationwide in water-induced disasters in the monsoon season that started in the second week of June. The disaster victims were still struggling to come to terms with their losses when people across the country were celebrating Dashain and Tihar.Now, a tougher time awaits disaster victims as the country heads into a chilly winter. The displaced people are staying under flimsy tents and tarpaulins, even as the authorities seem incapable of shifting them to temporary huts that could offer them some succour from the biting cold until their permanent houses are built. In his address to the country on October 23, nearly a month after the worst of monsoon disasters, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli directed the agencies concerned to prioritise the task of assessing damages and making temporary huts for the displaced people. In the same address, he conceded that government bodies hadn’t even assessed damages from the earthquakes that struck Jajarkot, Rukum West, Bajhang, Doti and Bajura a year ago, let alone carry out reconstruction work. The government had announced a total of Rs50,000 in two instalments to build temporary houses for those displaced in the quakes. According to the state-run newspaper The Rising Nepal, the people of Jajarkot district are yet to get the second instalment.Last winter, elderly people, children, pregnant women and those with chronic health problems suffered a lot in Jajarkot as the quake survivors had to live under flimsy tents for months due to the delay in reconstruction and rehabilitation works. When the mountainous districts witnessed rains during the winter, cold-related ailments including pneumonia caused serious problems, especially for small kids and elderly people. Owing to what can only be described as government apathy, hundreds of those displaced by natural disasters years ago can be seen staying under makeshift huts on river banks or in forest areas in various parts of the country.The problem is not always lack of resources. Mismanagement and the government’s failure to properly and timely mobilise available resources is also a reason behind the victims’ sorry plight. For instance, 77 institutional and individual donors have contributed over Rs1.87 billion to the Prime Minister’s Natural Disaster and Rescue Fund as of last week. Even in the past, disaster victims would be shivering under makeshift structures while the government would be sitting on the money donated in their name.As Nepal is vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, floods, glacial lake outbursts and lightning, relevant agencies must be well equipped to help the needy people on time. The situation won’t improve unless there are mandatory provisions with strict timelines to accomplish vital tasks such as assessing damages, shifting the displaced people to temporary huts, distributing money to build permanent houses and for rehabilitation. In the process, the role and responsibility of provinces and local units can be broadened. Also, by coming to the help of the people in times of crisis, the provincial and local governments have an opportunity to prove their relevance as self-governing entities. \nTens of thousands of people demonstrated in the eastern Spanish city of Valencia on Saturday over regional authorities’ handling of devastating floods that killed more than 220 people in one of Europe’s worst natural disasters for decades.In the latest demonstration over the floods, protesters filled the centre of Valencia demanding the resignation of regional government leader Carlos Mazon and chanting “Killers!”.“Our hands are stained with mud, yours with blood,” read one banner. Some demonstrators dumped dirty boots outside the government building while others plastered it with mud.Residents in stricken areas accuse Mazon of issuing an alert too late, at 8 p.m. on Oct. 29, well after water was already pouring into many nearby towns and villages.The Valencian leader has said he would have issued an earlier alarm earlier if authorities had been notified of the seriousness of the situation by an official water monitoring body. Mazon did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.“We want to show our indignation and anger over the poor management of this disaster which has affected so many people,” said Anna Oliver, president of Accio Cultural del Pais Valenciano, one of about 30 groups that organised the protest.Though the demonstration was largely peaceful, police charged stone-throwing protesters at one point and objects hurled at the city council building caused minor damage.Following days of storm warnings from the national weather service from Oct. 25 onward, some municipalities and local bodies raised the alarm much earlier than the regional government.For example, Valencia University told its staff on Oct. 28 not to come to work. Several town halls suspended activities, shut down public facilities and told people to stay home.Weather service AEMET raised its threat level for heavy rains in the area to a red alert at 7:36 a.m. on Oct. 29.Nearly 80 people are still missing in what is the most deadly deluge in a single European country since floods in Portugal in 1967 killed around 500. \n Qatar has told Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel it will stall its efforts to mediate a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal until they show “willingness and seriousness” to resume talks, its foreign ministry said on Saturday.The Gulf country has been working alongside the United States and Egypt for months on fruitless talks between the warring sides in Gaza and any disengagement from that process could further complicate efforts to reach a deal.The Qatari ministry also said press reports on the future of the Hamas political office in Doha were inaccurate without specifying how. Reuters had on Friday quoted a US official saying Washington had asked Qatar to expel the group and that Doha had passed this message on to Hamas.An official briefed on the matter also said on Saturday that Qatar had concluded that with its mediation efforts paused, Hamas’ political office there “no longer serves its purpose.”But three Hamas officials speaking off the record said the group had not been informed by Qatar that its leaders were no longer welcome in the country.Qatar has hosted Hamas political leaders since 2012 as part of a deal with the US, and the group’s presence there has facilitated the progress of talks.The war erupted when Hamas gunmen attacked Israeli communities on Oct. 7 2023, killing around 1,200 people and seizing another 253 as hostages. Israel’s military campaign has levelled much of Gaza and killed around 43,500 Palestinians.“Qatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in the round,” Qatar’s foreign ministry said.“Qatar will resume those efforts with its partners when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.”There was no official response from Hamas or Israel.The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal. Israel has previously rejected some proposals for longer truces. Disagreements have centred on the long-term future of Hamas and Israel’s presence in Gaza.Hamas in QatarWashington had told Qatar that Hamas’ presence in Doha was no longer acceptable in the weeks since the group rejected the October proposal, a US official said on Friday.Qatar has not set a deadline for Hamas’ political office to close or for Hamas leaders to leave Qatar, the official briefed on the matter said.Qatar’s foreign ministry said the Hamas office had been a channel of communication between the parties in Gaza and said it had contributed to a brief ceasefire and exchange of some hostages a year ago.The official briefed on the matter pointed to a previous episode in April when Qatar had reconsidered Hamas’ presence in the country, leading some Hamas officials to leave for Turkey.“After two weeks, the Biden administration and the Israeli government asked Qatar to request their return,” the official said, adding that Washington has said negotiations were ineffective when the Hamas leaders were in Turkey.Qatar, designated as a major non-NATO ally by Washington, has long sought a role as a link between Western powers and their adversaries in the region.The country hosts the largest US airbase in the Middle East but also allows Hamas and Afghanistan’s Taliban to operate offices in Doha. It also helped negotiate a prisoner exchange between the US and Iran last year.It is unclear how many Hamas officials live in Doha, but they include several possible replacements for leader Yahya Sinwar, whom Israeli forces killed in Gaza last month.They include Sinwar’s deputy Khalil al-Hayya, who has led ceasefire negotiations for the group, and Khaled Meshaal, widely seen as Hamas’ diplomatic face.The group’s previous leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Iran in July almost certainly by Israel, was also based in Doha. His body was flown to Qatar for burial in early August. \nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon over the last day have killed at least 40 people including several children, Lebanese authorities said on Saturday, after heavy Israeli bombardment pounded the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut overnight.At least seven people were killed in the coastal city of Tyre late on Friday, Lebanon’s health ministry said. The Israeli military has previously ordered swathes of the city to evacuate but there were no orders published by the Israeli military spokesperson on social media platform X before Friday’s strikes.The ministry said two children were among the dead. Rescue operations were ongoing and other body parts retrieved in the aftermath of the attack would undergo DNA testing to identify them, the ministry added.Strikes in nearby towns on Saturday killed 13 people, including seven medics from rescue groups affiliated to Hezbollah and its ally Amal, the health ministry said.At least 20 more people were killed in Israeli strikes on Saturday across the eastern plains around the historic city of Baalbek, the health ministry said.The Israeli military said it had struck Hezbollah infrastructure sites in the areas of Tyre and Baalbek, including fighters, “operational apartments,” and weapons stores.The Lebanese health ministry said Israeli attacks have killed at least 3,136 people and wounded 13,979 in Lebanon over the last year. The toll includes 619 women and 194 children.Israel has been locked in fighting with Lebanese armed group Hezbollah since October 2023, but fighting has escalated dramatically since late September of this year. Israel has intensified and expanded its bombing campaign, and Hezbollah has ramped up daily rocket and drone attacks against Israel.The Iran-backed group announced more than 20 operations on Saturday, as well as one that it said fighters carried out the previous day against a military factory south of Tel Aviv.More than a dozen Israeli strikes also hit the southern suburbs of Beirut overnight, once a bustling collection of neighbourhoods and a key stronghold of Hezbollah.Now, many buildings have been almost entirely flattened, with Hezbollah’s yellow flags jutting out from the ruins, according to Reuters reporters who were taken on a tour of the area by Hezbollah.Some buildings were partially damaged by the strikes, leading some floors to collapse and sending furniture and other personal belongings spilling onto parked cars below.Men and women were picking through the rubble for their belongings, shoving blankets and mats under their arms or into black plastic bags.“We are trying to gather as many (of our possessions) as we can, so we can manage to live off them, nothing more,” said Hassan Hannawi, one of the men looking for his belongings. \nAuthor Thomas Bell unveiled his second book, ‘Human Nature’, at a launch event hosted by KathaSatha at the Patan Museum on Saturday. The programme commenced with a conversation between Bell and Aditya Adhikari, a former journalist and columnist for the Kathmandu Post. In his conversation with Bell, Adhikari said, “The book explores the hills and mountains surrounding Kathmandu, offering much more than a travelogue. Bell has written about cultural history and the environment based on his research.” Having spent decades in Nepal, Bell’s new book blends travelogue with folklore, literature, art, and anthropology. It addresses topics like the impact of British Imperialists and external pressures on the environment.“The book is divided into four sections, featuring my four different walks through the Himalayas, each during a different season,” said Bell. In the first section, Bell delves into the theme of migration, covering various issues such as the moving of the Gurkhali soldiers, labour migrations to the Middle East, and the migration of birds, animals, and fish. He also touches on the arrival of the first settlers in the hills, Rai mythologies, and the shamanic histories of the landscapes. Similarly, the second section of the book details his journey to Dolpo. Adhikari remarked that he enjoyed reading Bell’s description of landscapes. The writer, however, mentioned, “I did not want to get too much into the whimsical description of nature, which was kind of challenging for me.”The final section documents Bell’s journey to Rara Lake, where he discusses the concept of wilderness. In his conversation with Adhikari, he said, “The idea of taming the wilderness is seen to be projected into the Himalayan region, due to which people were expelled from their homes.” He gave the example of Rara Lake, where residents were displaced to transform the area into the national park it is today. “On writing this book, I cast my net as far as it could reach because the subject of social issues is so expansive.” Bell mentioned that he relied on historian Mahesh Chandra Regmi's research and cited author Shanker Koirala as a reference from his work ‘Khaireni Ghat’. Bell also read a brief excerpt from his book and answered questions from the audience. In answering the audience queries, Adhikari emphasised that ‘Human Nature’ is mainly written for a Nepali audience, aiming to resonate more with local than international readers.Guests, including actress Manisha Koirala and writers Amish Raj Mulmi, Rishi Amatya, and Dia Yonzon, attended the event.  \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast partly cloudy skies in Nepal’s hilly areas on Sunday, with fair to partly cloudy conditions across the rest of the country. Light rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is likely in some hilly regions, with a chance of light snowfall in a few high hilly and mountainous areas.Similar conditions are expected tonight, with partly cloudy skies in hilly areas and fair weather in the rest of the country. Light rain or thunderstorms may occur in some hilly regions, while light snowfall is possible in higher-altitude areas.The division attributed these conditions to the partial influence of western and local winds across the country.On Saturday, Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 35.5°C, Jomsom the lowest at 2.5°C, and Dharan received the most rainfall at 13.8 mm. \nLilaballabh Adhikari, a provincial assembly member from the CPN-UML has been suspended from his party following allegations of involvement in a human trafficking case.Adhikari, who was law and internal affairs minister in the Koshi provincial government, resigned from the ministerial position on Wednesday after he landed in controversy over his visit to Japan without permission or prior notification. UML's Koshi Province chair Ghanashyam Khatiwada, issuing a statement on Saturday, said that Adhikari’s party membership has been suspended until the investigations reach a conclusion.“In light of the seriousness of the human trafficking allegations, we urge the government and relevant authorities to conduct a swift and thorough investigation. Until a conclusive resolution is reached, Adhikari is suspended from his role in all the party structures, including as a member of the National Convention Representative Council,” Khatiwada said.The controversy emerged when Adhikari, along with three other individuals, was sent back from Tokyo after being flagged by Japanese immigration due to suspicious documentation. Adhikari, who reportedly bypassed required travel protocols, subsequently resigned from his ministerial post amidst mounting ethical concerns.Nepal Police’s initial findings show that those who allegedly forged passports and went to Japan with Adhikari had paid Rs1 million each to attend an event in Tokyo.Adhikari departed for Japan on October 29 without informing the authorities concerned to attend an event organised by the Tokyo Metropolitan.The other three individuals who accompanied him were detained for investigation by the police, but Adhikari avoided arrest by presenting his ministerial identification. As of Saturday, he has not been apprehended.Adhikari, a lawyer by profession, represents Morang Constituency 2 (B) and has served multiple terms in the provincial assembly.Organising a press meet immediately after tendering resignation from the ministerial position, he claimed that he wasn’t involved in any illegal activity.In the meantime, the meeting of the UML Secretariat held in Kathmandu on Saturday endorsed the province committee’s action against Adhikari and also urged the government to conduct a fact-based and thorough investigation into the case. \nThe central committee meeting of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) on Saturday announced plans to initiate a second phase of protests, against what it describes as the government’s “authoritarian and autocratic tendencies.”The central committee meeting described the arrest of party chairperson Rabi Lamichhane as a deliberate attempt by the ruling coalition to politically corner the RSP.“Although the parliamentary investigation committee’s report on page 449 states there is no documented evidence implicating Rabi Lamichhane in the transfer of funds from the cooperative organisation to Gorkha Media Pvt Ltd, he was still arrested. This arrest clearly indicates the ruling coalition’s objective to politically corner the RSP,” reads the statement issued after the meeting.The RSP has called one and all to support its second phase of the protests.The party accused parties historically advocating for political freedom of now stifling new ideas and voices. The government’s actions, the party claims, are against the democratic values, constitution, and rule of law. “The RSP urges the general public to read the state’s dangerous character properly,” the party stated.Last month, police arrested Lamichhane to investigate charges of cooperative fraud and organised crime. He was taken to Pokhara as a case against him was filed at the Kaski district police office. The Kaski district court extended his remand on Tuesday.Also, a case has been filed against Lamichhane at the Rupandehi district police office and the court in the district has also allowed the police to arrest him for the investigation on charges of fraud. He has been accused of misusing millions of rupees from various cooperatives. \nWith Donald Trump returning to the White House, there are concerns over how his second term will shape the US foreign policy at large. And what will be its South Asia policy and by extension an outlook towards Nepal?Trumps’ ‘America First’ policy is seen as Washington’s possible drift towards isolationism but his South Asia policy could be guided by his closeness and personal bond with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Strengthening strategic ties between New Delhi and Washington and the evolution of Beijing-Washington ties are other factors to watch out, observers say.Former Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey said Nepal’s relations with the United States will remain unchanged irrespective of who enters the White House—a Republican or a Democrat.Nepal and the United States forged diplomatic relations on April 25, 1947, becoming only the second country to do so after the UK. Nepal established its embassy in Washington DC on February 3, 1958, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On August 6, 1959, the American Embassy in Kathmandu was set up. A number of Nepal’s honorary consuls are stationed in various US cities and a large number of Nepali nationals now live and work in the country.A Republican occupied the White House when Nepal and the US established diplomatic relations, said Pandey. Also, when Nepal opened its embassy in Washington DC and the US did so in Kathmandu, a Republican was at the helm. “When King Mahendra addressed the joint session of US Congress in 1960, a Republican president was in power. Later, when he travelled to the United States in 1967, a Democratic president governed the country. Then, when King Birendra paid a state visit to the US in 1983, there was a Republican president,” said Pandey. “This suggests that the US policy towards Nepal has been stable and smooth.”Though Nepal-US relations have been changing for the better, during Trump’s first presidency between January 20, 2017 and January 20, 2021, bilateral ties took a dip due to the controversy over accepting the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s $500 million grant.The MCC became controversial in Nepal and stirred up debates. After Washington’s repeated clarifications that MCC is not aligned with the US’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and introduction of the 12-point interpretive declaration, the US grant was ratified by the House of Representatives in February 2022. Nepal has also invested $197 million in the MCC projects.During Trump’s first term as president, the American request for Nepal to join the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and State Partnership Program also caused unease in Nepal. Successive governments have clarified that Nepal does not intend to join these two US initiatives.Nepal’s former permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva Sambhu Ram Simkhada hopes that relations between Nepal and the US will remain good in Trump’s second term.“But it is more important to see how relations between powerful countries evolve during Trump’s second term,” he said.In Trump’s first term, some of his decisions like withdrawing from the Paris climate pact, the World Health Organisation, ending US support for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and blocking abortion rights had an impact on Nepal as well. Nepal is looking for compensation for the damages from adverse effects of climate change, which is triggered mainly by the greenhouse gases emitted by large industrial countries.Nepal must tread carefully, said Pandey, especially with the US citizens electing a decisive president who wants no delays in action. Like Simkhada, former minister Pandey also believes that evolving ties between the US, India and China will shape Washington’s policy towards Kathmandu.Nepal is on the strategic radars of India, China and the US, said Pandey. “Therefore, it should be careful while navigating its relations with these three powers. Nepal should maintain healthy relations with both India and China.”Nepal should not be tempted to use its ties with one neighbour against the other, Pandey added.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has yet to issue a congratulatory message on Trump’s election but President Ramchandra Paudel and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli have congratulated the president-elect.In his congratulatory message on Wednesday, Paudel expressed confidence that the Nepal-US relationship would be further strengthened during Trump’s second term.Prime Minister Oli on Thursday stated that Trump’s return to the Oval Office is a historic chapter in American history. Oli also said that he looks forward to deepening Nepal-US relations, fostering mutual prosperity and cooperation under Trump’s leadership.“It would be interesting to see how the US relations with India and China evolve,” said Simkhada. “That will have a big bearing on Nepal-US relations, perhaps as much as Nepal’s own relations with these three powers.” Former Nepali ambassador to the United States Arjun Karki said that the US policy towards Nepal will remain unchanged despite changes in the US government as Kathmandu has already worked with the Trump administration. Karki served as Nepal’s ambassador to the United States during Trump’s first term. “But yes, some global policies he pursues might impact Nepal.”“In his first term, Trump cut or downsized the US funds in areas like climate change, access to the abortion rights, health, and financial assistance to the World Health Organization. If he continues on the same path, Nepal will be affected,” said Karki, who served as Nepal’s US envoy from 2015 to 2021.Karki believes the US policy towards Russia and Israel will change but not so much its outlook towards China. “Perhaps some of Trump’s interventionist policies might even be to Nepal’s benefit,” he adds.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \nIt’s now all but certain: Oli will visit China in early December. This trip would mark a break from the tradition of Nepali prime ministers making their first “official” visit to India. There is nothing to quibble about, as flying to New Delhi first is merely an unwritten custom, not a formal requirement. So, Oli’s planned visit to Beijing isn’t a breach of any protocol; rather, it could set a precedent.Yet questions have lingered over why Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hasn’t extended an invitation to Oli, sparking speculation that Oli began planning a trip to China after waiting in vain for an invite from New Delhi. In some circles, there is a belief that Oli’s ascension to power is not to India’s liking. Some within Oli’s orbit have remarked that certain foreign powers have been trying to unseat the government without providing evidence to support this claim.Oli and India amid global shiftsEven Oli can’t deny that his past actions and rhetoric have frequently irked New Delhi. While his assertive stance may have earned him a “nationalist” image among sections of Nepali society, it has also placed him in India’s bad books. Attempts at rapprochement have been met with a cold shoulder, leaving him to orchestrate his return to power. Since the 2022 elections, he’s worn many hats: Coalition partner, opposition leader, and now, once again, prime minister.Yet India appears unconvinced. While Modi’s government rolled out the red carpet for Arzu Rana Deuba of the Nepali Congress, who serves as foreign minister in Oli’s Cabinet, it has yet to extend an invitation to Oli, despite him being in office for over 100 days and even meeting Modi in New York in September. Meanwhile, Oli’s government has repeatedly signalled its keenness to host Modi in Nepal, failing to elicit any concrete response.Then, has India abandoned its long-standing tradition of hosting the Nepali prime minister soon after a new government is formed? If so, this raises broader questions about India’s much-touted “Neighborhood First” policy. Extending an invitation to Oli could have shown goodwill and reinforced New Delhi’s proclamation that “Nepal is a special priority partner.”Amid rapid geopolitical shifts, India may have set its sights on bigger platforms and larger roles in the world order, but it would do well not to ignore its neighbours or treat them based on the government of the day. On Nepal’s part, its foreign policy is becoming increasingly complex, extending beyond bilateral ties with India and China, as Sino-Indian and Sino-American tensions and interests intersect more with a growing US influence in Asia amid shifting global dynamics. Oli, as the incumbent, needs to tread carefully. His role demands deft management of relations with India and China while also recalibrating Nepal’s strategic posture in a complex and evolving geopolitical landscape.The northern nexusNepal’s communist leaders often lean towards, or appear to align with, China when they want to “send a message” to India. Oli is no exception. Even before an official invitation was extended, extensive media reports outlined Oli’s potential agenda for the trip, including efforts to secure a loan waiver for the Pokhara International Airport and agreements on some Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. The Chinese, who often practise quiet diplomacy, have yet to comment on Oli's planned visit. Meanwhile, the BRI remains a contentious issue in Nepal, with Beijing eager to reframe all China-funded projects under its banner. Oli currently leads a strong government with support from the Nepali Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Congress’s position on the BRI and other forms of assistance is clear—grants are acceptable but loans are not. If Oli avoids pushing too aggressively with China, potentially unsettling his coalition partner, his position remains secure. Deeper engagement with China could bring valuable infrastructure projects, but it also raises concerns about long-term dependency and potential political leverage. It’s up to Nepali leaders—especially Oli—to negotiate beneficial terms.The Nepali public is divided on Chinese aid: Some see it as a counterbalance to dependence on India, while others fear it might lead to undue influence from the north. Both views have merit and flaws, making it crucial for the current leadership to steer Nepal’s foreign policy in a direction that serves and safeguards the country’s interests.While Nepal could benefit from its northern neighbour’s economic and technological might, it is not in a position to ignore its southern neighbour, with whom it not only shares historical, cultural and people-to-people ties but also carries out a majority of its trade.The catchDiplomacy often works best when conducted quietly. Oli’s “preparations” to visit Beijing could have been kept under wraps until concrete plans were in place. The premature leak of his intentions by his circle allows room for speculation that this may have been a tactic to pressure India.While China seeks to expand its influence in Nepal, it remains cautious about provoking India to the point of confrontation. And India, too, appears hesitant to employ its usual political manoeuvres in Nepal, particularly after recent setbacks in its immediate neighbourhood. As the Sino-Indian relations show signs of thawing, Nepal stands to benefit from reduced regional tension. Oli would be wise to avoid antagonising either neighbour.Nonetheless, Oli has an uncanny inclination to critique India. While he uses backchannels to re-engage with New Delhi, his public jabs at India reveal his characteristic defiance. If his plan to visit China is driven more by spite than by a balanced foreign policy strategy, he risks making a strategic misstep.Even after over 100 days in office, Oli’s performance has been dismal on various domestic fronts. Neither Oli nor his coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, has been able to justify the formation of this “stable” government.With his political legacy on the line, Oli has an opportunity to “achieve something meaningful” as prime minister, and he should approach foreign policy with a view toward lasting impact.Foreign policy is certainly a tough balancing act for a country like Nepal, sandwiched between the world’s two large economies. In an era of fluid geopolitics, future Nepali leaders will likely face further challenges in balancing relations with both neighbours. Nepali politicians’ failure to pursue a cohesive and balanced foreign policy has already tarnished Nepal’s international image.In the intricate world of foreign policy, there’s little room for grandstanding. And, adventurism can backfire. Oli has a unique chance to set a precedent for independent, balanced diplomacy that could serve as a model for the country and his successors.His China sojourn could go beyond simply breaking the so-called custom of prioritising one neighbour over the other; it might even pave the way for a new approach. But this must be done in the best interest of Nepal, not to satisfy personal pride or vanity. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is known for his supposed ability to implement decisions and accomplish the tasks he takes up even at the cost of becoming unpopular.But a series of events after he became prime minister in mid-July tells a different story.In the three and half months since he assumed office at Singha Durbar, the prime minister has been compelled to backtrack on a couple of his plans or postpone them.In the first week of September, Prime Minister Oli pushed a plan to remove Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar from the post and elect a lawmaker from the ruling Nepali Congress in her place. According to multiple leaders privy to the development, by electing a Congress lawmaker as deputy speaker, Oli wanted to strengthen relations with the major coalition partner Congress, which has more seats than the prime minister’s party, the CPN-UML, in the House of Representatives. Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba has a special interest in getting a lawmaker from his party elected to the post, as deputy speaker is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which nominates members and heads of constitutional bodies.The prime minister on September 9 convened a meeting of the ruling parties and floated a proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar and sought a green signal from the coalition partners to his plan.After the meeting, party leaders told the Post that Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office. Deputy Speaker Magar courted controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role. On February 26 last year, Magar wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting a visa interview for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she was under pressure to step down.Last month, the prime minister held several meetings and consultations with a plan to introduce an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act-2017 with an intention to facilitate party splits. This plan also drew widespread criticism as leaders from various political parties and independent observers accused the prime minister of plotting splits of fringe political parties with a plan to merge their dissident groups into the UML.His proposal to introduce ordinance was reportedly floated in order to merge the Ashok-Rai led Janata Socialist Party and the dissident group from the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), which in turn would make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives.As the major coalition partner, the Congress, reportedly did not back his proposal to introduce the ordinance, Oli was again pushed to the back seat.These are just a few cases in point. Oli from the start of this tenure has struggled to assert his authority.Professor of political science Krishna Pokharel assesses that there may have been an understanding between Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli to arrest Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane, who was accused of misappropriating cooperative funds, and issuing an ordinance related to political parties.Pokharel believes that the two leaders might have reached a deal to accomplish the two goals—bring an ordinance to facilitate the split of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which was formed in 2021 after breaking away from the UML; and arrest Lamichhane. Lamichhane, the immediate past home minister, had reportedly tried to arrest Congress chief Deuba’s spouse (current foreign minister) Arzu Rana Deuba, on charges of involvement in the Bhutanese refugee scam. “While the wish of the Congress chief was fulfilled, the interest of the UML chair and the prime minister was not,” Pokharel said. However, the UML leaders don’t buy this argument. Vice-chair Yubaraj Gyawali said that the government under UML leadership has just completed its 100 days, so it is too early to judge its performance. “There are many good initiatives taken by this government whose results will come in due course,” Gyawali told the Post. “Everything that the head of the government wants cannot be achieved in such a short period, but that does not mean his influence has waned.” But some political analysts say that Oli’s standing has declined since he became prime minister this time with the support of Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Oli dismisses those who claim his influence has gone down. While addressing the symposium on ‘Role of former security personnel in National Security and Development’ organised by the Nepal National Former Army and Police Association on October 27, Oli rubbished claims that his influence was steadily decreasing.“Those who claim my charm has decreased will know the reality in the 2027 election,” Oli said.Sarita Bhusal, a UML lawmaker, said a mistaken impression might have been created among the people. “Sometimes there are constraints to leading a coalition government,” Bhusal told the Post.Gyawali, a vice chair of the UML, agrees. “Earlier, Oli became prime minister with the support of smaller parties. But this time, he has the backing of the largest party in Parliament, so it is not easy for him to do all that he wants.” Oli first headed a coalition government after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. When he became prime minister again in 2018 after the 2017 election, his party was the largest in the House. He became prime minister with the support of the Maoist Centre, which was his coalition partner during his previous stint as well.The Congress publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, said his party has been giving full support to the Oli government. “Our party has not opposed any government programme that is good for the country,” Bishwakarma told the Post. “We only caution the government on issues that may cause public backlash.”This government was formed in the spirit of a seven-point agreement between the two parties, and achieving those objectives must be its primary focus, Bishawakarma said. Of late, Oli has also faced criticism from within his party. Some UML leaders publicly opposed his recent decision to accept a donation from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of Bhatbhateni Supermarket, for the construction of the party’s head office. Experts see it as a sign of his decreasing hold in the party organisation. Although party’s standing committee member Binda Pandey and central committee member Ushakiran Timilsina protested against it publicly, other party leaders are also reportedly dissatisfied with Oli’s decision.Bhim Rawal, who contested the election for chair against Oli during the party’s 10th general convention in Chitwan in November 2021, also criticised Oli for accepting the donation. Sidelined by Oli, Rawal is currently inactive in the party. Even leaders like Gokul Baskota, who used to be a staunch Oli supporter, couldn’t back him on the deal with businessman Gurung.In an interview with Image television, Baskota said, “The UML cannot accept Gurung’s donation and carry his old baggage.” On October 28, the Supreme Court issued an interlocutory interim order barring the ruling party, UML, from building any structure on the land donated by businessman Gurung. A single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel said the UML-Gurung donation deal was illegal prima facie, putting Oli further on the defensive. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nEveryone is after contentment in life. Whether studying, working, or earning, our actions aim to achieve happiness. The desire for eternal happiness and peace is deeply rooted in human nature. ‘Ananda Samhita’ by Ghanashyam Khadka explores this universal pursuit: what happiness and sadness mean. It examines how people chase after happiness and suggests alternative approaches that might lead to fulfilment and inner peace.This book guides us to find peace and happiness within ourselves, independent of external or superficial influences. The author explains that people often chase happiness in ways that lead to disappointment. If happiness is dependent on fleeting moments, it isn’t true happiness. Instead, joy should be enduring and accessible of reason—if one can be happy without cause, nothing can take that joy away. Happiness and peace are ongoing states that come from within.The author suggests that sadness often arises from a lack of self-awareness. Happiness and sadness, he argues, aren’t the outcomes of events but rather our attitudes toward them. A positive approach to life can transform difficulties into opportunities, turning darkness into light and challenges into growth. Staying peaceful is an art; it doesn’t come by birth and can be achieved by preparation. The author explains everything in detail, helping readers grasp the content quickly. He uses relatable examples to bring depth to the ideas, encouraging readers to apply them to everyday life. This book contains questions and reflective activities that make us contemplate our lives. Khadka writes, “In the universe, we are very tiny; thus, stressing over minimal things and being sad is not worthy.” The book unfolds over 18 interconnected chapters, each guiding the reader to self-discovery and inner peace. Every chapter introduces a new concept and topic, which is also the chapter’s theme, building on the last and adding new layers. The author explains how the presence and absence of particular qualities or perspectives can shape our pursuit of peace, making each chapter a stepping stone toward achieving a more profound sense of contentment.The author has included different stories to bring the concepts to life, keeping readers engaged. These stories serve as relatable examples, making the ideas more memorable. For instance, he shares the story of a famous scientist, Albert Einstein, and his driver to illustrate how we naturally adopt traits from those we spend time with. This leads to his advice: surround yourself with people who inspire you, are intellectually curious, and are self-aware.While reading the book, I applied many suggested mindfulness practices and self-help tips. While philosophical books like this may not appeal to everyone, ‘Ananda Samhita’ engages readers with reflective activities at the end of each chapter, making them more interactive and applicable to daily life.Each activity encourages us to reflect on the chapter’s insights and integrate them into our daily lives. As I read through the activity guidelines and tried a few, it felt like meditating while listening to Prawachan. Yet, I struggled to concentrate and thoroughly follow the instructions. This experience made me realise that a calm, focused mindset is essential to truly absorb this book's wisdom and put its teachings into practice. Although reaching this level of immersion might seem unrealistic in our hectic lives, it’s precisely for this reason that the book was written.All the activities focus on positive self-talk and affirmations, which soothe the mind and heart, bring calmness, and build self-confidence. As the saying goes, “You become what you feed your mind.” We can move toward a positive life by practising positive affirmations and cultivating an optimistic inner dialogue.The writer advises that we should master our hearts rather than be ruled by them. He explains that true happiness and salvation remain out of reach if our hearts control us. By embracing our inevitable death, we can learn to value each moment, allowing us to live more fully in the present. This acceptance, he argues, leads to a deep awakening to life’s true worth.The author draws on the story of Siddhartha Gautam, who left his palace comforts upon realising death's inevitability. Gautam’s choice to renounce superficial pursuits underscores the importance of focusing on meaningful goals rather than allowing trivial distractions to sidetrack us. Life is uncertain, and by keeping this in mind, we can better appreciate its value and avoid wasting time on distractions that pull us away from our ultimate purpose, salvation.Moreover, the author backs the text with data, statistics, and insights from psychological theories by figures like Sigmund Freud, Carl Rogers, and Abraham Maslow, as well as scientific principles. He also incorporates Nepali proverbs and cultural sayings to ground complex ideas in relatable language. Khadka also talks about the teachings of Buddha and uses them as a reference. This blend of psychology, science, and spirituality creates a well-rounded and accessible framework for readers, making profound ideas easier to grasp.That said, this book may not resonate with everyone. As someone who doesn’t usually gravitate toward philosophical texts, I found ‘Ananda Samhita’ both challenging and thought-provoking. The author delves into philosophical, spiritual, and idealistic ideas that sometimes seem abstract or impractical yet carry profound meanings. While I respect the message about striving for peace and ending suffering permanently, I find it challenging to agree. In today’s fast-paced, highly competitive world, such ideals can feel out of reach and perhaps impractical for many.Additionally, the book introduces complex terms and concepts that, despite explanations, may still feel elusive to some readers. ‘Ananda Samhita’ is a thoughtfully researched book offering valuable insights into understanding our inner selves—something many overlook. The author’s engaging writing style captivates readers. The book also challenges our attachment to worldly possessions and questions how we perceive life, happiness, and sadness. Fresh perspectives in the text invite readers to reflect on their lives and guide them toward peace and happiness.Ananda SamhitaAuthor: Ghanashyam KhadkaYear: 2024Publisher: Alchemy PublicationPages: 231 \nThe next general elections are three years away, but political parties have already started devising strategies to secure victory.While all major parties are discussing ‘mission 84’ (election year 2084 BS, or 2027 AD), the CPN-UML is ahead of others in formulating strategies as much as it plans to collect private information on individual voters. In a bid to assess its strength, the ruling party has decided to find out the political affiliation of each voter.The country's second-largest party will send its volunteers to each household to find out the political leanings of the members. “Our local cadres know who our sympathisers are and who is associated with other parties. The study aims to find out the political inclination of those whose affiliations are not known,” Bishal Bhattarai, a UML politburo member and member of the party’s Organisation Department, told the Post. Such study has already started in local units where byelections are being held next month. The voting is taking place for 44 positions including mayors and chiefs of rural municipalities in 33 local units across the seven provinces on December 1. The seats had turned vacant due to deaths and resignations, and other reasons. The party plans to conduct the nationwide study for two months, from mid-February to mid-April next year. As per the schedule, the party’s central office will receive the reports from the local level by the end of the current fiscal year—mid-July.Party leaders claim the survey is for the party’s internal purposes to evaluate its strengths. “Based on the report, the party will devise its strategy to strengthen its positions wherever it is weak. Such surveys are done in other countries as well,” Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the party, told the Post.However, political experts don’t think the matter is as simple as the UML is trying to project. Krishna Khanal, professor of political science, said in principle there is nothing wrong with conducting surveys to collect information to devise strategies to mobilise party. “However, in a country like ours where the government’s treatment of people often depends upon their party affiliation, the ruling party studying the common people’s political affiliation is a serious matter. It will not only intimidate ordinary people, but also raises concerns that state machinery could be misused to bring neutral voters into the UML’s camp,” he told the Post.Some political analysts see this move as an intrusion into personal matters. Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, collecting information of individual party affiliation is not an acceptable act in democracy. “The UML is trying to adopt a radical communist strategy. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) applied a similar strategy to remain in power for long,” he told the Post.Not just the radical communists but right wing forces in India too are embracing a similar strategy to turn election results in their favour. During every election, from the municipal to Lok Sabha, India’s Bharatiya Janata Party appoints panna pramukhs (unit incharges), who are tasked with influencing voters at the household level.Every constituency is divided into blocks, with lists of voters from every 10 to 12 families. And a person called panna pramukh is assigned to pay special attention to the families of his/her designated area. Their job is to convince them to vote for the party. This strategy seems to have worked for the right-wing party, which won the elections for the third consecutive time in June. “It is not surprising to see that extremists, no matter whether they are right wing or left wing, adopt similar strategies,” said Pyakurel. The UML, which has seen a decline in the number of its organised cadres, wants to increase their numbers to at least one million which hovers around half that figure at present. It believes it can devise policy to increase its vote base based on the survey results. In the 2022 general elections, the country had 17.79 million registered voters.Pyakurel, however, doesn’t believe that the UML’s initiative is going to benefit it hugely during the elections. If his claims are anything to go by, swing voters have a significant share in Nepal and no single strategy by the UML is likely to guarantee results in the next general elections. Nepal is the country where pre-poll surveys are illegal although they are practiced elsewhere in the world. However, there is no restriction on a ruling party gathering information on people’s political affiliations. “The Election Commission must come forward to stop the UML’s move,” said Khanal, the professor.The UML leaders, however, say there is no need to ‘make a mountain out of a molehill’. “This is just the party’s internal survey. We are sensitive enough to individual freedom and the right to privacy,” said Bhattarai. \nPolitical parties have expedited their preparations for the by-elections slated for next month in various local units.The by-elections will be held on December 1 for various positions that went vacant due to various reasons after the local elections in 2022.As the Election Commission has fixed November 18 for filing the candidacy, parties are busy selecting their candidates for the 44 vacant seats ranging from the chief of the district coordination committees to the ward chairpersons.The voters from different local units will vote to elect two chiefs of the district coordination committees, chairpersons of two rural municipalities, four vice-chairs, one mayor, one deputy mayor and chairs of 34 wards. Votes will also be cast to elect chiefs of the district coordination committees in Okhaldhunga and Kailali, the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in Kathmandu, and the deputy mayor of Nalagad Municipality in Jajarkot.Similarly, the elections will be held to elect chairpersons of Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang and Mahabu Rural Municipality in Dailekh, and the vice-chairs of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality in Dolakha, Sarkegad Rural Municipality in Humla and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura.Additionally, elections will take place to elect ward chair positions in various local units including in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City and Kirtipur Municipality.The Local Level Election Act, 2016 envisions by-elections to fill vacant positions such as district coordination committee heads, vice-heads, rural municipality chairs, vice-chairs, mayors, deputy mayors, and ward chairs if their term has not expired and has more than a year left with for their term. The representatives in all the vacant positions were elected on May 13, 2022 with just half of their terms completed so far.Suman Ghimire, information officer at the commission, said the nominations can be filed during the office hours on November 17 and the list of candidates will be published by 6 pm the same day.Anyone who has an objection to the candidacy of any contestant can lodge the complaint the next day. Similarly, candidates will be allowed to withdraw their candidacies, if they wish so, by 1 pm on October 20.The final list of the candidates from all the vacant positions will be published the same day while the election symbols too will be allotted between 3 pm to 5 pm on the day.“Twenty-five parties have been registered in the commission to compete in the by-polls,” said Ghimire.According to the constitutional poll management body, the mayoral and deputy mayoral candidates can spend a maximum of Rs450,000, rural municipality chairs and vice-chairs are allowed to spend up to Rs350,000 while the aspirants for the district coordination committee chief and deputy can spend up to Rs50,000.Rs300,000 is the maximum amount the candidates for metropolitan city ward chairs can spend but the ceiling is Rs200,000 and Rs150,000 for the ward chairpersons of the municipality and rural municipality, respectively.The main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre) is ahead of other major parties in candidate selection. It has decided to field Shivsharan Maharjan, a professor by profession, for the vacant mayor's position in Kirtipur Municipality. It has picked Nimleki Sherpa for the vice-chairperson position in Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha. The third largest party has also finalised its candidates for the ward chairpersons in most of the local units where the by-polls are going to take place.The ruling CPN-UML has picked the contenders for by-elections in the local units from Kathmandu but is yet to decide for other parts. Surendra Manandhar, a UML central committee member, is the party’s mayoral candidate in Kirtipur. Laxmi Ratna Tuladhar will contest for chairperson of ward 16 of the Kathmandu Metropolis from the UML.Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the second largest party, said all the party’s candidates will be finalised within a couple of days.The Nepali Congress, on the other hand, has already received lists of the probable candidates from the respective local units but is yet to finalise the names. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which came into existence after the 2022’s local elections, is also preparing to contest the by-polls this time.All the parties, including those who had contested earlier polls forming pre-poll alliances, have announced they’d contest the upcoming elections independently. \nTwo ruling parties have formed a three-tier political mechanism—at the centre, in the provinces and in the districts—in order to facilitate the government of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML at the centre and to resolve any disputes at the provincial and district levels.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba will head the mechanism, according to a statement issued by the secretariat of the newly announced body on Wednesday. The first meeting of the mechanism was held on Tuesday. At the central level, they formed an eight-member team with four members from each party. Among them are the parties’ office bearers and ministers in the Oli Cabinet. However, in the provinces and districts, each party will have three representatives in the task force.The decision to form the joint mechanism is aimed at minimising the differences between the two parties, supporting the spirit of government formation agreed in mid-July when the parties came together, according to ruling party leaders.The development comes at a time when the popularity of the Oli government is dipping as it fails to revive the ailing economy, unlike what was promised in mid-July. The mechanism is also tasked with removing the obstacles to the two parties’ coalition so that it continues to govern until the elections in 2027. Formation of the mechanisms at provincial and district levels are said to be in the final stage.Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak are Congress members in the task force while UML senior vice-chairman Ishwar Pokhrel, General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel and deputy general secretary Bishnu Rimal are representing Oli.The decision was made on October 31, Rimal told the Post. The objectives of the mechanism are to support and facilitate the works of the three-tier government.Representatives from the two parties will lead the mechanism by turns. Khadka of the Congress will coordinate the meetings for a month from November 5. At the provincial level, Congress provincial party chief, incumbent chief minister or the parliamentary party leader (in case the party is not leading the provincial government) and the senior member of the provincial Cabinet will be members of the task force.From the UML, provincial party chair, provincial in-charge and parliamentary party leader will be members of the task force, said Rimal. At the district level, Congress party president and two office bearers will be the members.The UML district in-charge, party chair and secretary will be represented in the task force, according to Rimal.The political mechanism also announced the visit of Prime Minister Oli to China scheduled for December 2-6. But the government is yet to make a formal announcement of the visit. At the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, prime minister Oli is paying an official visit to China in December. As per the instructions of Prime Minister Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana will coordinate the visit. The task force will lay the groundwork for the visit , the statement added. Rana has already cancelled her scheduled trip to Baku, Azerbaijan where she was to attend the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference. President Ramchandra Paudel is leading the Nepali delegation in the UN climate change conference. The main objective of the three-tire mechanism is to assist and support the federal, provincial and local governments, said Rimal. The provincial and district level mechanisms will resolve disputes related to government functioning, he added. “The main purpose of the mechanisms is to convince people that the government will deliver and address their needs. The mechanism will help restore trust and hope and will solidify the Congress-UML alliance,” added Rimal.Leaders said that there is good working relations between the two parties at all three levels.“This government will complete its full term. The current political Oli-Deuba partnership is doing well as there is a high level of mutual trust,” said Rimal. He said the government would stay intact so long as the trust between Oli and Deuba remains intact and so long as the UML remains a united party. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nTen people were injured in a bus accident at Ghumaune in Kharipati of Bhaktapur district on Tuesday. Two are reportedly in critical condition.According to Pradeep Khatri, a traffic police inspector and chief of the District Traffic Police Range, the bus coming from Talakot of Changunarayan Municipality lost its control and hit a pole. The injured are undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital, police said. \nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nThe heavy rainfall in late September, which triggered floods and landslides in most parts of the country, caused a loss of Rs46.68 billion to Nepal’s economy, nearly three-fold more than the initial estimates.According to the preliminary loss and damage assessment report released by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority under the home ministry on Thursday, the floods and landslides from September 26 to 28 caused significant damage to the physical infrastructure sector, followed by the social and productive sectors.According to the report, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology reported that out of 222 rainfall measurement stations across Nepal, 77 recorded heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving over 200 millimetres in just 24 hours. Kathmandu experienced its highest rainfall on record, surpassing previous measurements set in 2002. The Tribhuvan International Airport station recorded 239.7 millimetres of rain, highlighting the intensity of the weather system affecting the region.More than 83 percent of the total economic losses were observed in the physical infrastructures, amounting to Rs38.92 billion.The report said that 41 roads and highways were damaged. The estimated cost of repairing and maintaining the roads and highway infrastructure is Rs27.98 billion. Blocked or damaged roads hinder transportation and supply chains, complicating relief efforts and economic recovery.In the hydropower sector, the damage to 26 facilities has caused an estimated loss of Rs30.18 billion. This loss has significantly hit energy supply, impacting residential and industrial consumers.Nepal’s electricity imports are likely to surge this winter due to the delay in the reconstruction of hydropower plants. The 456MW Upper Tamakoshi hydropower project, Nepal’s largest in operation, has failed to resume generation since late September. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, 980MW of output has been interrupted.Similarly, damage to 446 telecommunication units has resulted in a loss of R152.30 million.The destruction of 1,678 federal and provincial water supply and sanitation systems has led to an estimated loss of Rs5.90 billion. The report said that the loss affects access to clean water and poses health risks, particularly in the wake of disasters that often exacerbate waterborne diseases.Forty-four bridges sustained damage, resulting in an estimated financial loss of Rs1.04 billion. The report said the damage severely hampers connectivity and affects transportation and logistics in the region.The social sector has experienced profound impacts, particularly in housing and settlements. As per initial reports, 5,996 houses were destroyed, while 13,049 were damaged. This destruction has displaced 10,807 families, impacting 16,243 individuals who are now living in public shelters and facing challenges in finding basic amenities, according to the report.Six infrastructures were fully destroyed in the health sector, and 43 health facilities were partially destroyed. This limits access to essential medical services during a critical time when health needs are heightened due to potential post-disaster health crises. The education sector has not been spared either, with six schools destroyed completely and 136 schools partially damaged, further disrupting education for countless children.There were 249 deaths and 178 injuries, and 18 persons are still missing, the report said. The highest number of fatalities have been reported in Dhading, followed by Kavre and Lalitpur districts. In terms of human impact, Bagmati reported the highest fatalities at 208, while Koshi saw 20 deaths. The report said over 17,000 individuals were rescued, and more than 14,800 police personnel were deployed across affected areas. The most extensive police operations were in Kathmandu Valley and several districts in the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces. In the productive sector, agriculture and livestock incurred substantial losses. The assessment indicates that 65,380 hectares of agricultural land and 26,698 livestock have been affected, resulting in an estimated economic loss of Rs5.88 billion. The report said that the significant impact on agriculture threatens food security and farmers' livelihoods, who rely heavily on their land and livestock for income.Seven irrigation projects have been affected, leading to a loss of Rs1.35 billion. The destruction of irrigation infrastructure jeopardises crop yields and exacerbates the agricultural crisis after the disasters.This assessment underscores the vulnerabilities of the affected sectors and the importance of comprehensive disaster preparedness and resilience-building measures to mitigate future risks.Bagmati province reported the most extensive damage, with 424 houses destroyed and 743 impacted.Bagmati province reported the highest levels of destruction, with 4,414 houses fully destroyed and 7,157 partially destroyed, affecting more than 14,517 families and displacing 9,997 families. Kavrepalanchok district was particularly hit, with 3,121 houses fully destroyed and 5,749 partially destroyed.  \n\nKaski residents have started redeveloping the Krapu Kwholasothar trail, a circuit trek of religious and historical significance that remains unexplored.Kwhlosothar, located 3,283 metres above sea level, is in the southern part of Annapurna and Lamjung. It can be reached through Tangting, Sikles, Kori and Yangjakot of Kaski and Pasgaun, Bhujung, and Ghanpokhari of Lamjung.The shortest route is from Tangting.Locals say it's not just an ordinary trekking trail for it connects Kwholasothar, an ancient village believed to be Nepal's first Gurung or Tamu settlement, with ruins of an ancient town over 1500-1200 years old.Until half a decade ago, northern Kaski and Lamjung locals used this route to bring salt from Tibet.A decade ago, a joint research team from Cambridge University of the UK and the Central Department of Geology, Tribhuvan University, studied the artefacts in Kwhlosothar.Bed Bahadur Gurung, a Gandaki provincial assembly member and former chairman of Madi rural municipality, said the trail has many historical and archaeological sites for pilgrimages for the Tamu [Gurung] people and could be an important historical attraction for Nepali and foreign trekkers.Kwhlosothar or Kohla Sothar is divided into three villages—lower, middle and upper. ‘Sothar’, in the Gurung language, means three villages. Locals and researchers say Kohla Sonthar resembles the 15th-century Inca ruins of Machu Pichu in Peru. For a long time, people have been demanding the area be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.“There are many historical artefacts, including houses and palaces, in these three villages,” said Gurung.There are caves after walking two hours more from Kwhlosothar at the height 3,800. ‘The cave is known as ‘Chamsyo Nagra.’Gurung remembers when his father brought salt via Tangting of Kwhlosothar-Namun Bhanjyang-Larke Pass-Tibet route five decades ago.When the road from Pokhara-Butwal opened, the people of Kwhlosothar stopped going along the mountainous route.No human settlement exists above Tangting, but many sheep and buffalo herders can be found there.Gurung said that before the Annapurna Conservation Area Project was established in 1985, foreign trekkers used to go for camping treks. However, since the project didn’t include the Kwhlosothar, trekkers stopped hiking in the area and remained isolated.The project promoted Manang, Lamjung, Thorong Pass, Mustanf, Myagfi and Annapurna Base Camp, Ghandruk-Ghorepani, but Kwhlosothar remained in the shadows.In Tony Hagen's book Building Bridges to the Third World: Memories of Nepal 1950-1992, the Swiss geologist mentions his travel experience to Namun Bhanjyang, from the base of Machapuchhre to Sikles, Madi River, and Krupudanda.The trail was named the ‘Tony Hagen Trail’ after Bed Bahadur Gurung became the chairman of the Madi rural municipality to promote it.“This trail needs to be redefined to allow people to know the historical importance of the place. The provincial and local governments and tourism entrepreneurs of Lamjung, Manang, and Kaski all need to play an equal role in promoting the area,” said Gurung.The Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment of Gandaki Province, Nepal Tourism Board office in Pokhara have been allocating a budget to promote trails in Madi in Kaski, Kwhlosothar of Lamjung and Chame of Manang. But on the promotional front, locals say nothing has been done.The Gurung Tourism Entrepreneurs Association has named the trekking route the Gurung Heritage Trail.“As trekking trails have been losing charm due to haphazard road construction, such trails are still untouched by modern development,” said Kisham Kumari Gurung, president of the association.“These trails can draw high-end trekkers, which can create jobs and increase the income of people in the areas,” said the president. “Gurung heritage trail has a combination of nature and culture.”Gurung heritage trekking trail has been developed from Tangting to Danda-Tapro-Kwhlosothar-Thulilek-Thurju-Dudh Pokhari-Gurung Deurali-Danfe Kharka-Timang to Besi Sahar, said Bobar Jung Gurung, founding president of the association. The association's members and others recently conducted a 10-day trekking trail exploration and promotion programme.The trekking trail includes Kwhlosothar (3,283 metres); Thulilek, a vast grazing area (4,070 metres); Dudh Pokhari, a religious place (4,585 metres); Namun Bhanjyang (5,560 metres); and Danfe Kharka, a yak grazing area (3,862 metres).The Annapurna Conservation Area Project and the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal coordinated the exploration. The trekking can be completed in 12 days.As a motor road has been reached to Ghandruk and Ghorepani of Annapurna Conservation Area, reducing the charm of trekking, the new trekking trail can be an alternative, said Deepak Sapkota, a member of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal, Gandaki.“In this area, we can revive camping trekking, which can be a big draw for trekkers.” \nAs the deadline to reduce 50 percent of existing deaths and disabilities from snakebites nears, herpetologists and public health experts emphasise the urgency for awareness and training for local health workers to meet this crucial health goal.They say that fatalities and disabilities from snakebites can be significantly reduced if vulnerable populations, especially children, women and farmers residing in rural areas, are made aware of the risks.“Along with the awareness, health workers serving at the local level should be trained to deal with snakebite cases,” said Dr Sanjib Kumar Sharma, rector at BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “Trained health workers can manage snakebite cases more effectively than others.”Snakebite, which kills hundreds of people every year, is a major public health scare in Nepal.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. Snakebite incidents are also common among cattle, and thousands of farmers are affected every year.The government has committed to reducing 50 percent of deaths and disabilities through snakebite envenomation by 2030, the national target aligned with the World Health Organisation’s ‘Snakebite Roadmap’.“The government has created a pool of doctors and experts for snakebite case management and master trainers,” said Sharma. “Along with other measures, authorities concerned should also focus on launching an awareness drive, which will make a huge difference in lessening overall snakebite incidents.”Moreover, along with awareness, identifying the snake will also be crucial for case management. Health workers ask the public to take photos of snakes if they are able to after they are bitten, which helps them identify the snake so that they can start treatment accordingly.“Archive of the photos of snakes available in the country should be maintained so that health workers could identify the snakes’ types and start treatment accordingly,” said Dr Sunita Ghimire, a molecular biologist. “Risk of deaths and disabilities increases due to inability to identify the snakes’ type.”Experts say authorities must also strengthen health infrastructures to achieve the target. They say due to poor infrastructure in healthcare facilities—lack of doctors, anti-snake venoms, ventilator support systems, and kidney dialysis facilities—dozens of people die from snakebite every year.While health facilities are ill-equipped and short on anti-snake venom, many people in rural areas lack awareness and often consult shamans instead of physicians.Doctors say women who go to the fields to collect fodder, farmers who do plantations or harvest, and children who play in open areas are more vulnerable to snakebite.Poor people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats, their fodder.Experts say there should be a greater awareness drive on keeping the houses and surroundings clean, preventing children from playing in the bushes and avoiding walking at night. If absolutely necessary, people must use torchlights while walking in the dark.Nepal imports polyvalent antivenom from India, which is effective against four common species of snakes found in India: the common cobra, common krait, saw-scaled viper, and Russell’s viper. Saw-scaled viper has not yet been found in the country.Deaths from pit viper bites in the hills and mountainous regions have also risen recently. However, the antivenom made for other venomous snakes does not treat pit viper’s case. \nAt least 23 died, including one in Kathmandu Valley, and over 80 people have been infected with the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since June this year.The number of reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as tests were carried out only on those hospitalised patients after their conditions got severe, officials say.“The death rate from the Japanese encephalitis infection is the highest among the vaccine-preventable diseases,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division. “Relevant health agencies have been taking all necessary measures to prevent infection and deaths from the virus.”Cases of the deadly viral disease have been reported in 30 districts of six provinces except Karnali. What concerns health officials is the death rate rising alarmingly every year—around 29 percent in the current fiscal year. Fatality among children under 15 years is very high while complications from JE infection could cause permanent injuries to the brain and the nervous system.Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection, endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organisation, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to a half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Data from the health ministry show that less than 50 percent of the infected patients were found inoculated with the vaccine. Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines have been developed to prevent infection. Health officials, however, said that their attempts to convince development partners, including the World Health Organisation, for a mass JE vaccination campaign have not succeeded.“We have raised the issue several times with officials from the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation and requested their support,” said Lal. “But as of now, none of the agencies is convinced to support JE vaccination. Either the government has to decide and secure the funding source, or the aid agency should invest in the JE vaccination.”The National Immunisation Advisory Committee, an expert panel, has also not recommended mass JE vaccination despite the high mortality rate.“Vaccine does not help in controlling the ongoing epidemic,” said Dr Ramesh Kanta Adhikari, senior immunisation expert and a National Immunisation Advisory Committee member. “We are ready to carry out a feasibility study, hold review meetings and discussions with the concerned experts and stakeholders to recommend the JE vaccination campaign if the government decides the same.”In 2005, JE killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the Tarai districts. Nepal started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organisation officially issued prequalification certification, due to high rates of infection and deaths from the virus at the time.In the first phase, all populations of the highly affected four districts—Banke, Bardiya, Dang, and Kailali—were given the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into routine immunisation in 2015. Even then, people still die, and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.The Ministry of Health and Population said its attention has been drawn to the spread of a deadly virus that has killed around two dozen people and infected scores of others.“I have called a meeting of the officials concerned from the Family Welfare Division to discuss the issue on Friday,” said Pradip Paudel, minister for health and population. “We have taken the issue seriously and will make some decisions to prevent deaths and infections from the JE virus.”Public health experts say this is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk. Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity against future infections. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise avoiding mosquito bites, such as by using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or travels to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal. \nA team of senior health officials from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, who were deployed recently in Gandaki Province to assess the latest situation of the dengue spread, returned with complaints. Along with health workers serving at local bodies and provincial hospitals, elected representatives and local leaders of political parties, with whom they discussed, complained about exorbitant testing charges at private laboratories.“We are aware of the excessive prices being charged by private labs for dengue testing and held discussions about setting a maximum price but couldn't reach a decision,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “For the next dengue season, we would make a decision about slashing the testing charges.”Nepal has been witnessing a rapid surge in new cases of dengue infection in recent months. Health authorities, however, do not concede that the number of new dengue cases is rising alarmingly. Doctors say there could be dengue patients in almost all households, especially in the Kathmandu Valley and in major cities like Pokhara.Officials say that state-run health facilities do not charge for dengue testing, and they are aware of excessive charging by private labs despite the significant decline in the cost of rapid diagnostic test kits.“It cost less than 100 rupees for a rapid diagnostic testing kit, but private labs have been charging excessively,” an official at the Department of Health Services said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “Due to a lack of regulation, private labs and hospitals have been fleecing patients, and health officials have been avoiding making decisions to appease the private laboratories and hospitals.”Public health experts say that it was obvious for patients to bear brunt when the authorities concerned, including the health minister, focus on gaining popularity by announcing populist programmes that are not feasible to implement with existing resources.“Some hospitals have been charging up to Rs 3,000 for dengue tests,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “When the authorities forget their prime duties and fear antogonising private hospitals and labs, it is inevitable that patients will suffer.”Most state run health facilities and labs remained closed during Tihar holidays, which forced infected patients to seek services at private hospitals. Meanwhile, the Department of Health Services said that its attention has been drawn to the excessive charging for dengue testing at private labs.“I have noted the issue and will discuss it with the Health Ministry,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We will make some decisions regarding this issue.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.So far, only 12 people have died, and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often concealed the actual number of deaths and infections.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nIn rural Madhesh, where cultural norms and limited access to healthcare compound an already fragile health infrastructure, women’s sexual and reproductive health needs are often sidelined.For many women there, awareness of their own bodies and health needs remains a distant reality. Seeking help for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues is often a last resort.Seema Kumari Pasman, a 20-year-old from Karmahi village in Dhanusha who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy, is one such example.Married at 16 in 2019, she quickly became a mother of two children by 2022.After two child births, her menstrual complications worsened, yet she had no frame of reference to understand that what she was experiencing—menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding—was a medical condition.Pasman endured a year of painful, prolonged periods that she had been taught were simply part of a woman’s life—a burden, not a condition needing treatment.Daily chores became unbearable for her but those around her continued to dismiss her symptoms.One night in December 2023, after collapsing while fetching water from a hand pump, Pasman’s family rushed her to Janakpur Provincial Hospital.There, doctors diagnosed her with severe anaemia from untreated menorrhagia. “The doctors told me that if I had received earlier intervention, my suffering could have been prevented...but I only thought it was normal,” Pasman says.The culture of silence around SRH issues means that women like Pasman get help only when their conditions are critical.A 2018 study in the Journal of Health and Allied Sciences reported low awareness of SRH rights among 384 married Madheshi women in Sarlahi. Three-fifths were unaware of these rights, and the same proportion reported experiences of physical and dowry-related violence.Chandra Rekha Issar, a gynaecologist at Janakpur Provincial Hospital and assistant professor at the Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences (MIHS), says that for many women, the concept of openly talking about SRH—especially with male doctors—is almost unthinkable.In rural Madhesh, as part of ‘ghunghat pratha’, married women have limited interaction with unrelated men outside their family. They are often expected to wear a veil in front of everyone except their husbands and rarely go outside alone for extended periods.This restrictive environment creates a hesitation among women to discuss their SRH. When these women visit a gynaecologist and are assigned a male doctor, it often leads to discomfort.Health consultations can thus become uncomfortable or are avoided altogether, exacerbating a pattern of undiagnosed and untreated conditions.At Janakpur Hospital, this cultural barrier plays out every single day.Kamala Devi Mandal, a 30-year-old woman from Khariyani, Janakpur, sat clutching her veil in the waiting area of the Department of Gynaecology, with her mother in law on the side.When her turn came, Mandal hesitated upon seeing a male gynaecologist, Raj Kishor Pandit, at the door. Despite a female attendant’s presence, Mandal’s mother-in-law ultimately did the talking, while Kamala remained silent, visibly uncomfortable.For Issar, these hesitations are all too familiar. She works alongside male gynaecologists in a department where only four of the 13 doctors are female.“In a setting where women are uncomfortable speaking about reproductive issues, especially with male doctors, we have to proceed carefully, often through the person accompanying the patient,” she says.Most of the female patients are accompanied by family members, as husbands are often working abroad.For something as basic as the date of their last menstrual cycle, the patient often defers to the person accompanying her. “Most of them are under a veil,” Issar added, “and removing it, even for an eye check to assess anaemia, takes coaxing… It requires long counselling for women to open up. At times, the information we receive is incomplete, which creates challenges in treatment.”If patients still hesitate to see a male gynaecologist after counselling, a female gynaecologist is assigned when possible, says Issar. However, this is often unfeasible during busy hours due to limited staff compared to the high patient load.Gynecologist Issar says that about 85 percent of the hospital’s gynaecology and obstetrics cases involve pregnancy-related complications, often worsened by malnutrition, lack of prenatal care, and early marriages.General gynaecology accounts for 15 percent of patients, with menstrual issues like dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding common among adolescents under 19, while older patients face infections, cervical cancer, and uterine prolapse.Due to early marriages, multiple childbirths, and home deliveries without medical supervision, many women develop uterine prolapse—a condition typically seen in older women but increasingly common in those as young as 30 in rural Madhesh.The gendered expectations that govern interactions in rural Madhesh leave women ill-equipped to advocate for their health.“During a health camp in Saptari, I found that over ten percent of women under 35 had uterine prolapse,” Issar says. “Early marriage and childbirth in an environment without health education or postnatal care have serious consequences.”The barriers also include outdated beliefs and superstitions which affect women’s diet and recovery after childbirth.“Although the situation has improved, women in remote Madhesh are often prohibited from consuming protein-rich foods like chicken soup or meat after giving birth,” says 24 year old Sapana Ray, a bachelor’s student in public health at Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences. “They are typically allowed only one meal of roti and are discouraged from more water and meal, as it’s believed that this prevents colds and other illnesses in the child,” Ray added, “This lack of nutrition contributes to malnutrition and anaemia, exacerbating their health issues.”When rural women lack basic health literacy, common gynaecological issues go unchecked, leading to preventable complications. For instance, over 80 percent of cases at Janakpur Provincial Hospital are critical.“Most of these severe cases could have been prevented with early intervention or just an understanding of basic health,” Issar says.As Issar sees it, comprehensive awareness campaigns are crucial for educating women about sexual and reproductive health.“The government should consider monthly outreach programmes in rural areas. Women in far rural communities need direct, consistent health education,” Issar says. Further, local health posts with trained personnel could provide preventive care and answer questions women may hesitate to bring up in a hospital setting.The hospital’s efforts to include female attendants in male doctors’ consultations and to counsel women on gender-neutral healthcare only go so far. Often, patients’ deep-seated fears and hesitation prove challenging to overcome.While Madhesh’s women struggle with silence and a lack of resources, healthcare professionals are left piecing together fragmented stories, trying to heal patients who are often reluctant to share their suffering. It is a race against time and tradition.Dr Issar says that it’s unfair to blame women for hesitating to discuss their issues with gynaecologists. “We need to understand and empathise with their background,” she says.Many women, living in conservative settings, rarely have the freedom to speak openly. Given this, she questions, “How can we expect them to feel fully comfortable discussing their sexual and reproductive health, especially with a male doctor?” Even for educated urban women, she adds, these conversations can be challenging.According to Ray, consistent ground-level awareness and counselling programmes on SRH are essential, alongside changes to the conservative and predominantly patriarchal settings in rural areas. “These social barriers, even more than medical intervention, are often the primary obstacles to healthcare access for women in these communities,” she says. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal’s hopes to qualify for the ICC U-19 Women’s T20 World Cup suffered a huge setback after they lost their Asia Qualifier match to hosts United Arab Emirates by 13 runs at the Sevens Stadium in Ajman, the UAE on Saturday.The loss puts Nepal two points below the hosts, who have maintained their unbeaten streak in the competition and sit in the summit of the four-team group with six points from three matches.The top-placed finishers at the end of the double round-robin league will advance to the 2025 ICC U-19 Women’s T20 World Cup, which is set to take place in Malaysia.It means Nepal’s dream to play their maiden U-19 Women’s World Cup is not over yet.Nepal’s defeat gives the UAE—who are looking to reach their second World Cup after debuting in the main event in 2023 in South Africa—an edge in the race but Puja Mahato’s side will need extra effort in their remaining fixtures, particularly against the UAE when the two sides meet again on November 13 in the second round of the competition.Nepal gave the UAE early scare dismissing opener Emily Thomas for a duck, trapped lbw by Mahato, in the first over and Samaira Dharnidharka for eight in the fourth, caught by Rachanna Chaudhary off Krishma Gurung.Thomas’s opening partner Lavanya Keny and Rinitha Rajith rebuilt the innings taking the UAE past 75 but Riya Sharma broke their stand when she caught and bowled the former for 20 in the 12th over.Rajith continued the resistance to drag the UAE close to the 100-run mark before Seema KC dismissed her in 14.1 overs. Rajith departed with 33-ball 48 which would prove crucial in their defence of the 122 total.Sharma was the pick of Nepal’s bowling with 3-15.Nepal started the chase at a slow pace as they lost opener Sabitri Dhami for six and were at 39-2 halfway into the innings when Sana Praveen fell to Mekak Thakur in the 9.3 overs.Puja Mahato rekindled Nepal’s hopes with 48 and took her side past 100 total with some support from Sony Pakhrin (19) and Jyotsnika Marasini (11 not out).But Indhuja Nandakumar put a break to Nepal’s march removing Mahato in the 18.4 overs.The target was still achievable with 20 more needed from eight balls but Nepal fell short in the final push. \nIndia opener Sanju Samson scored a sparkling century as the tourists beat South Africa by 61 runs in the first match of a four-game Twenty20 series in Durban on Friday.South Africa asked India to bat and the visitors posted 202 for eight in their 20 overs, before restricting their hosts to 141 all out in 17.5 overs for a comprehensive victory.India’s total was boosted by a brilliant 107 from 50 balls by Samson but the innings did stall towards the end.Samson smashed 10 sixes and seven fours as he tore into the bowling at the small Kingsmead ground. He rattled along at a strike rate of 214, providing more than half his team’s total.“The amount of hard work he (Samson) has put in over the last few years, doing those boring things again and again, he is reaping the fruits (now),” India captain Suryakumar Yadav said.“He is putting the team first, even when he was in the 90s he was looking to hit fours and sixes. That’s what separates him.”At 167-2 in the 15th over, India looked on course for a score well in excess of 200, but managed only another 35 runs in 32 balls for the loss of six wickets after Tilak Varma was dismissed for 33.Seamers Marco Jansen (1-24 in four overs) and Gerald Coetzee (3-37) were the pick of the home attack.India’s legbreak bowlers stifled the South African reply as their innings never managed to gain momentum.Varun Chakravarthy took 3-25 as he picked up the key wickets of Heinrich Klaasen (25) and David Miller (18), while Ravi Bishnoi recorded figures of 3-28.“We wanted to get off to a better start (with the bat) and that’s where we lost the game,” South Africa captain Aiden Markram said.“Sanju played incredibly well, put our bowlers under pressure. When a guy is striking like that, it is pretty hard to stop him and you have to take your hat off.”The second match of the series will be played in Gqeberha on Sunday. \nNepal will kick off their 2024 ACC U-19 Men’s Asia Cup against Sri Lanka on November 29.The U-19 Asia Cup is scheduled to take place from November 29 to December 8 in the United Arab Emirates.Nepal have been drawn alongside defending champions Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan in Group B. India, Pakistan, hosts UAE and Japan are in Group A.Nepal next play their group match of the 50-over tournament against Bangladesh on December 1 before facing Afghanistan two days later.The group winners and runners-up from each group will progress into the semi-finals, which will take place on December 6. The final will be held on December 8.Holders Bangladesh won their maiden U-19 Asia Cup title in December last year, defeating the UAE by 195 runs in the final.Nepal U-19 men’s team, who qualified to the Asia Cup as the champions of the ACC Men’s U-19 Premier Cup, are making their ninth straight appearance in the Asia Cup. However, they have made it past the group stage only once, in 2017, when they finished in the second position and above India in their group. That Nepal’s U-19 squad included the likes of current national team members and star cricketers Dipendra Singh Airee, Sandeep Lamichhane, Aasif Sheikh, Anil Sah and Rohit Paudel and also beat India on the way to the last four, which they lost to Afghanistan by seven wickets.UAE and Japan qualified to the Asia Cup as Premier Cup runners-up and third placed team.Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka got direct berths to the Asia Cup as full member nations. \nQatar will stop trying to mediate a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal until Hamas and Israel show a “sincere willingness” to return to the negotiating table, an official briefed on the matter told Reuters on Saturday, in the biggest setback to efforts to reach a truce since the war began.The small but influential Gulf country has also concluded that Hamas’ political office in Doha “no longer serves its purpose”, the official added, in a further blow to the Palestinian militant group whose top leaders have been assassinated by Israel.Qatar, alongside the United States and Egypt, has played a major role in rounds of so-far fruitless talks to broker a ceasefire to the year-long war in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages Hamas is holding in the enclave. The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal.“The Qataris have said since the start of the conflict that they can only mediate when both parties demonstrate a genuine interest in finding a resolution,” the official said.Qatar has not set a deadline for Hamas’ political office to close or for Hamas leaders to leave Qatar and it was unclear if the move could be reversed.Qatar informed Hamas, Israel and the US administration that it would be willing to resume its negotiating role if Hamas and Israel “demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiation table with the objective of putting an end to the war,” the official said.There was no official response from Hamas.A Palestinian official close to the mediation talks said: “Hamas may not comment unless it is informed officially by Qatar. So far it is media talk.”Washington had told Qatar that Hamas’ presence in Doha was no longer acceptable in the weeks since the group rejected the latest proposal to achieve a ceasefire and a hostage deal, a US official said on Friday.Qatar's government reconsidered Hamas’ presence in the country in April, which the official said prompted the group's leaders to leave for Turkey.“After two weeks, the Biden administration and the Israeli government asked Qatar to request their return,” the official said, adding that Washington has said negotiations were ineffective when the Hamas leaders were in Turkey.Qatar, designated as a major non-NATO ally by Washington, has hosted Hamas' political leaders since 2012 as part of an agreement with the US.It is unclear how many Hamas officials live in Doha, but they include several touted as possible replacements for leader Yahya Sinwar, whom Israeli forces killed in Gaza last month, including Sinwar’s deputy Khalil al-Hayya, who has led ceasefire negotiations for the group, and Khaled Meshaal, widely seen as Hamas' diplomatic face.The group’s previous leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Iran in July almost certainly by Israel, was also based in Doha. His body was flown to Qatar for burial in early August. \nAt least 24 people were killed and more than 40 injured in a bomb blast on Saturday at a railway station in the city of Quetta in southwestern Pakistan, police and other officials said.Quetta is the capital of Balochistan province, which is grappling with a surge in strikes by separatist ethnic militants that has raised security concerns for projects aiming to develop the province’s untapped mineral resources.Inspector general of police for Balochistan Mouzzam Jah Ansari said 24 people have died so far from the blast at the railway station, which is usually busy early in the day when the explosion took place.“The target was army personnel from the Infantry School,” he said, with many of the injured in critical condition. Quetta Commissioner Hamza Shafqat said 16 soldiers were among the dead.The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement emailed to Reuters.The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan, a province of about 15 million people that borders Afghanistan to the north and Iran to the west. The BLA is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups battling the government, saying it unfairly exploits the province's rich gas and mineral resources.“So far 44 injured people have been brought to civil hospital,” Wasim Baig, a hospital spokesperson, told Reuters.Senior superintendent of police operations, Muhammad Baloch, said the blast seemed to be a suicide bomb and that investigations were underway for more information.“The blast took place inside the railway station when the Peshawar-bound express was about to leave for its destination,” Baloch said.In August, at least 73 people were killed in Balochistan after separatist militants attacked police stations, railway lines, and highways.The assaults in August were the most widespread in years by militants fighting a decades-long insurgency to win secession for the province, home to major China-led projects such as a port and a gold and copper mine. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nIn 1932, Juddha Shumsher Rana's Jawalakhel Zoological Garden housed various animals, including tigers, rhinos, hippos, red pandas, and a lion, which were primarily kept for his entertainment and amusement with limited public access.\nUpon becoming President, Masoud Pezeshkian appointed Abbas Araghchi as Foreign Minister, aiming to improve Iran's relations with the West while facing challenges from neighboring countries and Israeli attacks in Gaza and Lebanon, leading to a delicate balancing act between national security and diplomatic outreach.\nDespite major obstacles, including criminal convictions, assassination attempts, and political opposition, Donald Trump's focus on economic concerns and the perceived failure of his opponent Kamala Harris resonated with voters, leading to his victory in the US presidential election, showcasing the irrational nature of voters and the allure of simple emotional appeals in an era of social media and widespread dissatisfaction.\nDespite announcing ambitious free healthcare initiatives, Nepal's healthcare system lacks resources and funding, raising concerns about the feasibility and potential negative impacts of such programs.\nKathmandu, Nepal will establish a consumer court to address widespread market malpractices, including low-quality goods and price manipulation.\nFrequent plane crashes, natural disasters, poor infrastructure and bureaucratic challenges—they all ail Nepali tourism. There is a dire need to ramp up efforts to get it on track. But then we as a country are taking a step back when the rest of the world is looking to boost tourism with robust plans and policies. The Civil Aviation Authority’s latest decision to close Tribhuvan International Airport—Nepal’s only ariel gateway for foreign tourists and the sole door of opportunities for millions of its citizens—for 10 hours (10 pm to 8 am) to complete a long-overdue taxiway expansion, has garnered national and international criticism for the strain it will put on the country’s tourism.While there is nothing wrong with the project to renovate taxiways that have worn out from years of use, the authorities perhaps didn’t consider its impact on tourism and passengers seriously. The airport closure from November 8 to March 31 is bound to inconvenience foreign visitors as it coincides with both autumn and spring peak trekking seasons. Festivals, family reunions, holidays and favourable weather make this season the perfect time to travel to Nepal. Such a prolonged halt will only dampen people’s enthusiasm. One is left wondering why such a vital time was chosen for these renovations.The financial repercussions are substantial. The Nepal Tourism Board, which had aimed for 1.3 million tourists this year, has cut down the expected number to 1.1 million. This could lead to a revenue loss of around Rs50 billion for the airline and tourism industry. Indirect cost could be many times higher. International airlines have cut flights or cancelled tickets at short notice, taking airfares to all-time highs. For instance, the most popular destination in November, Sydney, which would have cost Rs85,000 on normal days, will now cost Rs217,000 (for the highest priced tickets) and Rs114,000 (lowest). For average Nepali workers and students, these fares are unaffordable. Tourism entrepreneurs are facing losses as hotels are reporting cancellations.In 2019, for the same project, the airport was closed for seven hours (11:30 pm to 6:30 am) after which 24/7 operations began for the first time to compensate for the lost flight hours. Earlier this year, too, for the very project, landings from the northern side of the airport were barred, but there were no airport closures. Given these precedents, one would have expected more robust planning this time. Instead, it seems there has not been enough homework. The civil aviation authorities’ efforts to manage the Kathmandu airport’s congestion by redirecting traffic to Pokhara and Gautam Buddha international airports have also failed because no foreign airline operator is willing to fly to these destinations. Travel trade entrepreneurs lament that this “unplanned construction” is taking too long and fear it might extend to spring, another peak tourist season. This is understandable given Nepal’s poor record in completing roads and infrastructure. They have also urged the authorities to limit the shutdown to five hours. However, that risks further delaying the project. A balanced approach that prioritises tourism and passengers while ensuring timely completion is the best. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) request that the authorities shorten the closure or spare high-traffic days is logical. Halting operations at peak arrival and departure is neither wise nor sustainable. Ultimately, the health of the country’s civil aviation is closely linked to the state of its regulator. Right now, it appears that our top aviation officials are working more for themselves than for the benefit of the intended beneficiaries.  \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nOn Saturday the weather in Koshi, Gandaki, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province along with the hilly regions of the country is forecast to be partly cloudy while the rest of the country is to remain partly cloudy to mainly fair.Light rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of the hilly regions of Koshi, Gandaki, Karnali, and Sudur Pashchim Province and at one or two places in the hilly regions of the rest of the province.Tonight the weather will be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of the country and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the Province.
