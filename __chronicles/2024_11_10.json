Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nIndian restrictions on Nepali goods, including sanitary pads, diapers, shoes, and cement, have halted exports, causing economic distress and unemployment in Nepal despite repeated inquiries and attempts by the Nepali government to resolve the issue.\nPM Oli will visit China to implement past agreements, focusing on the Belt and Road Initiative, and seeking loan waiver for Pokhara Airport, while maintaining balanced relations with India and China.\nDespite agreements, parliamentary committees remain inactive, hindering progress on essential bills, potentially leaving the winter session without adequate business.\nIn a bid to promote exclusive breastfeeding practices, the Ministry of Health and Population has hired 36 staff nurses for deployment to 18 federal and provincial hospitals across the country.Officials hope that deployment of specially trained nurses at federal and provincial hospitals will help promote exclusive breastfeeding practices, which have been steadily declining in recent years.“Two internal experts have been appointed to train child health specialists, who will later train the staff nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division, under the Department of Health Services. “We are also planning to hire breastfeeding counsellors at district hospitals in future.”Studies show that Nepal's exclusive breastfeeding rate has steadily declined over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022, exclusive breastfeeding dropped consistently from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It stated that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), compared to 12 percent of those born at home.Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is prone to contamination and increases the risk of diseases in children, according to the World Health Organisation.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to breastfeed their babies, as studies show. “Hospitals complain that they do not have staff to promote exclusive breastfeeding within their facilities,” said Thapa. “We hope that deploying staff nurses from the centre will help address this staff crunch.”Officials said that the United Nations Children’s Fund has supported the government in hiring staff for exclusive breastfeeding and bringing in international experts to prepare master trainers.The report shows that the proportion of children who are bottle-fed increases with mothers’ education, rising from 12 percent among children of mothers with no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Bottle-feeding is most common in the highest wealth quintile—46 percent—and least common in the lowest wealth quintile—11 percent.Among the seven provinces of Nepal, exclusive breastfeeding rates are the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest at 11 percent in Karnali Province, 12 percent in Madhesh Province and the highest at 43 percent in Bagmati Province.Doctors recommend breastfeeding for the first two years of a baby’s life or longer, as breast milk lowers the risk of illness in children, promotes their recovery during illness, and provides important nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nNepal on Saturday announced a final 18-man squad for the 2024 ACC U-19 Men’s Asia Cup, which is scheduled to take place in the United Arab Emirates from November 29 to December 8.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) announced the squad under the captaincy of Hemant Dhami. Arjun Kumal will be Dhami’s deputy.Dhami will replace Dev Khanal, who led Nepal’s U-19 team at the World Cup in January earlier this year. Khanal recently travelled to Canada and the United States with the senior team to participate in the Canada and US Tri-Series.The U-19 team will also be without Gulsan Jha. Jha failed to carry his form and experience with the senior team to the U-19 World Cup but has now established himself as the key member of the senior team.Aakash Tripathi and Uttam Rangu Thapa Magar are the other cricketers from the U-19 World Cup squad to retain their place in the U-19 team.Shakti Gauchan has been given the responsibility as head coach, while Dhirendra Chand will join the team as assistant coach.Nepal will kick off their Asia Cup campaign against Sri Lanka on November 29.Nepal have been drawn alongside defending champions Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan in Group B.India, Pakistan, hosts UAE and Japan are in Group A.Nepal next play their group match of the 50-over tournament against Bangladesh on December 1 before facing Afghanistan two days later.The group winners and runners-up from each group will progress into the semi-finals, which will take place on December 6. The final will be held on December 8.Holders Bangladesh won their maiden U-19 Asia Cup title in December last year, defeating the UAE by 195 runs in the final.Nepal squadHemant Dhami (captain), Arjun Kumal, Aakash Tripathi, Uttam Rangu Thapa Magar, Mayan Yadav, Naren Saud, Unish Bikram Singh Thakuri, Naren Bhatta, Santosh Yadav, Yubaraj Khatri, Roshan Bishwakarma, Bipin Kumar Mahato, Rajesh Yadav, Dayanand Mandal, Aparajit Paudel, Abhishek Tiwari, Dilshad Ali, Ranjit Kumar.  \nThe Kaski District Court has extended the detention of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) Chair Rabi Lamichhane for an additional 13 days to allow further investigation into alleged cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering charges.On Sunday, the court approved a 13-day remand for Lamichhane and three others detained on similar charges. Judge Navaraj Dahal’s bench granted the extension, as confirmed by court spokesperson Suraj Adhikari.The others in detention include former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, co-director of Gorkha Media Network, along with Leela PachhaI and Ram Bahadur Khanal, all suspected of similar offences.Lamichhane was initially arrested on October 18 from the RSP central office in Kathmandu and brought to Kaski. Following an initial six-day remand, he faced subsequent extensions of seven and ten days before this latest 13-day extension.A parliamentary special probe committee, formed in May to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives, concluded that Lamichhane was involved in misusing millions of rupees funnelled into Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives when he was managing director of the now-defunct media company that operated Galaxy 4K Television. This alleged misuse occurred before he entered politics in June 2022. \nSeven passengers lost their lives while 13 more sustained injuries in a jeep accident at Raduneta of Palata Rural Municipality-3 of Kalikot district.Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, the chief district officer of Kalikot, confirmed that among the 20 passengers on board a Bolero jeep, 10 died at the scene. Other passengers sustained injuries.The jeep, carrying 20 passengers from Thirpu in Palata, met with an accident at approximately 2:30 pm on Sunday, plunging 500 metres off the road.A Nepal Army helicopter from Surkhet was sent to the crash site to assist with rescue operations. Further details on the incident are yet to come. \nFormer minister for internal affairs and law of Koshi Province, Lilaballav Adhikari, who was arrested earlier on Sunday in Biratnagar over allegations of human trafficking, has been transferred to Kathmandu for further investigation. His arrest was allowed by the court today, and he was subsequently escorted to Biratnagar Airport by police.The former provincial minister, Adhikari, landed in controversy for his alleged involvement with a human trafficking ring that recently arranged fake identification documents for three young men attempting to enter Japan. Adhikari and the youths were deported by Japanese immigration authorities last week, and while they were detained upon their return at Tribhuvan International Airport, Adhikari reportedly evaded investigation by using his ministerial identification.The accused ex-minister and three others had travelled to Japan under the pretext of attending the \"Culture at Heart\" programme in Tokyo, organised by Arts Council Tokyo from October 29 to November 3. It is alleged that Adhikari led the group with plans to exploit the event for human trafficking.While Japanese immigration authorities turned the group away due to suspicious documents, criticism arose after Adhikari avoided immediate investigation. Evidence, including fake identification papers used by his associates, has since been seized by authorities, with Adhikari’s signature purportedly forged on some documents.Adhikari has admitted to travelling under the influence of a trafficking network, claiming he was unaware of the criminal nature of the arrangement until he reached Hong Kong. However, officials suspect he only reported the issue to Nepali authorities after Japanese immigration rejected his entry. The ongoing investigation by the Kathmandu District Police has also led to the arrest of other suspects involved in the network.Adhikari had proceeded with the trip despite warnings from Koshi Province’s Chief Minister Hikmat Karki against the unauthorised international travel. \nEighteen Nepalis trafficked through multiple countries to reach Bulgaria were arrested three months ago for entering without valid documents. The Nepali Embassy in Germany, which provides consular support to Nepalis in Bulgaria, confirmed that the Nepalis were detained on charges of illegal entry.The Bulgarian authorities are preparing to deport the detainees this week. They are currently held at a deportation centre in the capital city, Sofia. “There are 18 of us here, waiting for travel documents,” one detainee said. “We hope to be repatriated soon.” The detainee added that none of them have passports. “The Bulgarian authorities have contacted the Nepali Embassy to arrange travel documents for our return.”Sagar Prasad Phuyal, the deputy chief of mission at the Nepali Embassy in Germany, confirmed the embassy’s coordination with Bulgarian authorities to expedite the deportation process. “We have issued the necessary travel documents,” Phuyal said. “The Bulgarian government will cover their travel costs to Nepal, and they are expected to be deported by next week.”The detainees reportedly travelled from India to Romania, then Hungary, and finally Bulgaria, with many initially arriving in Romania on work permits. Of late, there are some reports of instances of some Nepalis abandoning their legal work status in Romania and attempting to reach other European countries.“I was planning to go to Poland,” said one detainee. “I had a three-month Bulgarian visa, but it expired, and I was arrested. Returning to Nepal is now the only option left.” \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel has departed for Azerbaijan to attend the 29th Conference of the Parties (COP-29) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Baku. President Paudel left Tribhuvan International Airport on Sunday.Vice President Ram Sahaya Prasad Yadav, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, and other distinguished officials were present at the airport to bid farewell.President Paudel’s participation follows an invitation from Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. Leading a high-level Nepali delegation, he will represent Nepal at the conference. Nepal’s head of state is scheduled to address the ‘World Leaders Climate Action Summit’ on Tuesday during the high-level sessions on November 12 and 13, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.According to the Ministry, Nepal will conduct a separate high-level session under President Paude’s leadership on November 13 to draw global attention to its climate agenda. \nSome serious newspapers have raised a crucial question recently—why is the Nepali response to the current atrocities of war so scant? This inquisition has an element of sarcasm: Are we not sensitive enough about world events? However, the main concern is about the silence of the Nepalis or the Nepali press on the colossal suffering of men, women and children caused by indiscriminate bombings and shootings that are reported every day. Given that the scale of suffering and physical assaults has surpassed all known limits, this concern is natural. “The scenes may be disturbing” has become the common warning of news anchors, a constant admonition of the apocalypse, as it were. It seems we live in a time when visuals of disaster jostle to take space in our system of understanding the world. Among the horrific events that are common are the wars and killings in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan, to name a few. Besides these, more incidents are happening that assail our sensibilities. The common pattern of suffering and atrocities is uncanny. Lethal bombs fall on peaceful cities and suburbs, hospitals and schools. Never before have such insensitivities showing children crawling out of the rubble, crying in horror and women mourning their dear ones, been reported or recorded as today. I recall one literary event organised by the institution of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) literary writers, held from December 3-6, 2023, in Delhi. The theme of the conference was “Anguish over Senseless Wars.” I want to cite from my article, published in this newspaper under the title of the above-mentioned theme, about the writers’ protest against war: “The anguish felt by the writers about wars, especially the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Gaza wars, truly reflect literary writers’ concern. Non-partisan humanists, creators and advocates of peace and welfare, the writers get hurt more than the others by the colossal loss of lives, including children, in these and other senseless wars. All artists are touched by wars that are truly senseless. There are many instances of writers’ opposition to the wars. But they have paid heavily for such gestures. There is a history of banning books written against wars and other atrocities. In several places today, the voices of writers are drowned; they are even persecuted.” (The Kathmandu Post, December 24, 2023). The general complaint is that Nepali response to world events is not commonly featured in our media, nor does it occupy a space of importance in serious academic discussions. Maybe we must first look at our response to wars and atrocities in history. The Nepali youths, perhaps more than many others in Asia, have encountered and experienced the effects of world events, including wars, with personal involvement, physical loss of lives, and suffering. Researchers have discovered the songs composed by these youths who fought in the First World War as British soldiers. As an example, I would like to mention the research works of Alaka Atreya Chudal, a Vienna University teacher. Several such works record the experience of the Nepali youths who fought in the Second World War. That spectre of history continues to haunt and attract the Nepali youths today. I have no space to mention them here. What it shows is that the Nepali response to world events in history had a subjective and existential character. This subject needs a different treatment. Experiencing the effect of world events differs from looking at the incidents and making objective assessments. But it is natural for us to question today or at any other time about the scanty response to the current horrid events in our political expressions and the media. One Nepali youth, Bipin Joshi, was kidnapped by Hamas in the October 7 attack last year. The complaint is that the killings of civilians in the punitive attacks are not sufficiently reported and that people have not expressed their views on the events. But my impression is that we have responded well to these events. Nepali print and visual media are reporting the events regularly. The other quality of the world events is their diffused and confusing nature. Over the years, the events around the world did not have any recognisable nature. Covid-19 was a crisis that evoked the diverse responses of various world leaders, and the problems became serious after that. World events have had devastating effects on people's minds. In the words of Gordon Brown, Britain's former prime minister, “The world is on fire. At no time since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 has the world looked so dangerous, nor has an end to its 56 conflicts—the highest number since the Second World War—seemed so distant and so difficult to achieve.\" (The Guardian, April 12, 2024). That remoteness and staggering number of events make it difficult for any media or individuals in Nepal to respond to the events. Our response is politically and emotionally oriented, a recognisable pattern in the world today. But the conditions that generate world events go beyond the control of those responsible for them. The rise of certain individuals to power with global effects and the temptation to invade others’ territories and kill innocent people indiscriminately appear to shape the patterns of current events. Nepalis who have their own way of dealing with the world do respond. Their expression is shaped by their political ideologies or sheer humanitarian concerns. And that is happening. There is no space to cite examples here. It is natural for the media to allude to this subject and be surprised at Nepali media’s sparse response to people’s sufferings in all the “senseless wars”. We can question the causes of such a limited response to the terrible suffering of people in the wars. One reason is the emergence of a very boisterous and acrimonious political culture in Nepal, with political groups, media and the public spending most of their time on it. I would not call it solipsism, but this is certainly a subject of concern. Developing a comprehensive vision is the answer.  \nThe American fate has been sealed. Donald Trump has been elected the 47th President of the United States. If his victory in 2016 was more than just a fluke, it is convincing and comprehensive this time. This is what the common Americans want, and the rest of the world will have to live with it, just like the supporters of his Demoractic rival, Kamala Harris, who are still in shock.We can discuss what Trump’s re-election means for the rest of the world and this region, but let us first take a longer detour to understand what is brewing inside the world’s largest democracy.American nightmareIn the first week of March 2024, The New York Times published a report based on their telephone survey of around 980 registered voters, where they interviewed each participant about their perception of the two US presidential candidates. The survey, conducted in collaboration with Siena College in New York, showed that Trump had the support of 44 percent of the prospective voters, compared to 38 percent who favoured then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden. The survey results were significant, considering Trump's exit in 2020 as one of the most disliked presidents in US history, with multiple criminal charges against him. More significantly, only a quarter of the respondents thought the country was on the right track, and around 50 percent believed that the Biden administration’s policies had personally hurt them. A few weeks before the polls, the survey team returned to the seven states, known as the battleground states, to understand the voting behaviour of roughly 7879 likely voters. Close to 90 percent of the participants were certain they would vote, but interestingly, 62 percent were undecided or refused to discuss their voting preference. The question then is, why were television channels and political pundits predicting Harris’s victory when the data and survey polls were far from conclusive? The answer is a bitter pill that analysts and panellists, engaged in an unenviable job of predicting elections, have difficulty swallowing. The world is unfair, and people usually make choices that benefit them personally. From our own electoral experiences, in a developing or developed country, in a highly progressive democracy or a flawed one, we have learned the hard way not to take the voters for granted. Common voters—unlike a party worker, an academic or a self-styled activist, can be individualists who think only about what the candidate has to offer and how their policies affect their lives. They are not always burdened by the higher morals of society, nor are they too concerned about events that don’t directly impact their lives. This is especially true if the voters believe their interests are being put at stake by their representatives in the name of a larger public good. This is at the heart of the majoritarian conservatism that is leading the world into a democratic back-sliding. For millions of people of colour, including Asian Americans, who migrated to the US in the 80s and the 90s, the American dream from Hollywood movies became a reality when the US government adopted a diversity policy to fulfil its skilled manpower needs. There is every reason to believe this policy boosted the US economy and projected the country as the land of democracy and dreams for minorities. But what did it do to the mindset of the majority of white Americans, including the working middle-class population? We do not know, do we? The nationalist rhetoric, often spewing hate against immigrants of different colour and races, did not gain strong support among a large section in a day or a decade. My own experience of writing and talking about the political inclusion of minorities has taught me spending too much time talking in an eco-chamber can blind-sight you from the reality unfolding right before your eyes. The sooner intellectuals and activists in the US understand this, the more they will be invested and interested in understanding the insecurities that have haunted their majority population. After all, the economic and environmental shocks the world has been facing since the last few decades have affected us all, irrespective of race, gender or ethnicity.The global aftershocks If Trump’s re-election has sent shockwaves within the US, its aftershocks will be felt across different continents. His final months of the campaign focused on convincing the Americans that the Biden-Harris administration was bleeding the US economy by fighting proxy wars and that he would get both Putin and Netanyahu to end the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. It will take more than two months for Trump to assume office at the White House and another month for his administration to be in order. Any chances of direct talks with Russia and Israel, if at all, are a few months away. In the Indo-Pacific region, Trump will most likely continue on the course set by the previous administration. Given the global economic crisis that has had far-reaching consequences for both the Chinese and the American economies, Beijing and Washington have agreed to a gradual de-escalation in the Indo-Pacific. Any radical departure from this course will hurt both superpowers and push the global economy into another meltdown. The de-escalation between the nuclear powers will also benefit smaller South Asian states caught in a difficult big-power rivalry. A parallel development in this regard is the US’s relationship with India, which has been strained by the alleged involvement of Indian diplomats in espionage and attempted assassination on US soil. Similar allegations by Canada have resulted in a severe diplomatic fallout with New Delhi. It is unclear how the incoming Trump administration will react to these developments, especially when there is pre-existing discontent over New Delhi’s close ties with the Russians while continuing its security alliance with the US in the Indo-Pacific. If the recent Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) summit in Russia is of any consequence, Washington will need more than just a fleeting interest in the region to fix things with New Delhi. But is Trump ready to ride the high tides in the Indo-Pacific just yet? The president of the US is the world’s most powerful executive, commanding the largest economy and military. So, Trump's re-election as president is one of the most significant political developments of this decade. While Trump’s position concerning the climate crisis and human rights is deeply concerning, the global community will be more interested in his efforts to restore peace in war-ravaged Europe and the Middle East. On the domestic issues, however, we can only say: God bless America! \nFollowing 9/11, the ashes of the World Trade Centre in New York ignited fires in different parts of the world. Even now, 23 years later, those fires are proving difficult to extinguish. The so-called War on Terror (WoT), much like the Cold War, has been an expansive war, which has directly or indirectly affected almost every nation. It would, therefore, be of interest to examine their similarities and differences.The term ‘Cold War’ was first used by George Orwell, the nom de plume of Eric Arthur Blair, in an article in 1945. The war itself commenced with the announcement of the Truman Doctrine in 1947 and concluded with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The WoT started about 10 years later, in 2001. The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in 2021 was celebrated as the end of the WoT. However, post-withdrawal developments proved that the WoT had merely entered a new phase. The US may have physically withdrawn from the theatre, but its strategic interests remained intact. Even today, the great powers and major terrorist groups do not know when the WoT will end.While the Cold War was between two blocs, with other states taking a side, the ongoing WoT was supposed to be between nation-states and violent non-state actors. In reality, some states did provide space, finances, and ideological and diplomatic support to violent non-state actors; otherwise, it would be difficult for the latter to survive.Therefore, though terrorist groups were also active during the Cold War, the post-9/11 era saw a mushroom growth in their numbers. Al Qaeda was established much before the WoT, but it spawned and inspired a number of extremist groups thereafter. The WoT not only impacted the sovereignty of states but also the territorial integrity of a few. Countries like Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and Afghanistan faced instability and were confronted with civil war-like situations.The Cold War was primarily an ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism; the WoT was about combating terrorism based on a struggle against extremist ideologies. The Cold War and WoT both influenced international relations, with alliances shaping geopolitics. The Cold War saw Soviet expansion, with the capitalist bloc trying to contain it. For some analysts, the Cold War was a smokescreen for the US to influence and control events in Western Europe and Japan. On the other hand, the WoT remained largely focused on specific regions, particularly in the Middle East. The Cold War spawned a nuclear race and indirect military engagements, while the WoT saw direct and prolonged military engagements, as seen in Afghanistan and Iraq.To recognise its strategic partners in 1987, the US designated Major Non-Nato Ally (MNNA) status to various countries.MNNAs are not members of Nato but are entitled to certain benefits in military cooperation. Out of the 20 countries with MNNA status, eight received it before 9/11, while 12 countries obtained this status in the post-9/11 era. This highlights how the US grew its military influence around the world following the WoT.The WoT is not restricted to national borders and involves many countries and international coalitions. The WoT often involves state actors combating non-state actors and has therefore influenced security legislation and policies such as the US’s Patriot Act, which extended surveillance and law-enforcement powers within the world’s most powerful nation as well. The WoT also brou­ght with it human rights concerns, es­­pe­cially about tortu­­re, detentions (for example, Guan­tá­namo Bay) and targeted killings via drones.During the initial phase of the WoT, religious ext­remism, ethnic di­­vides, and political marginalisa­­t-ion fur­ther comp-lica­t­­ed the milit­a­ncy la­­ndscape. The WoT gained impetus from globalisat­ion, technological innovations, the openness of media and the stren­gth of social media, which triggered rights and peace movements on the one hand, while enabling the speedy dissemination of hate material and fake news on the other.States with weak economies cannot completely isolate themselves as either parties or victims of violent conflicts. The survival and effectiveness of states require a greater focus on countering violent narratives, which is not possible without investing in social empowerment and improving public service delivery.Terrorism is a transnational phenomenon. There is a need for an increased realisation that terrorism and conflicts benefit only a few powerful entities, while the rest pay the costs. For powerful states and violent non-state actors, terrorism is a commercial enterprise and a source of power, pleasure, and profit. The truth is that sole reliance on military might is not an antidote.—Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nPeople in 71 local units across 20 districts in Nepal were affected by rain-induced disasters in the last week of September. Landslides and floods triggered by incessant rains resulted in massive loss of human lives and infrastructure in Bagmati Province, including the Kathmandu Valley, as well as in the hilly districts of Koshi Province. Over 250 people died as several settlements were swept away. Altogether, around 391 people were killed nationwide in water-induced disasters in the monsoon season that started in the second week of June. The disaster victims were still struggling to come to terms with their losses when people across the country were celebrating Dashain and Tihar.Now, a tougher time awaits disaster victims as the country heads into a chilly winter. The displaced people are staying under flimsy tents and tarpaulins, even as the authorities seem incapable of shifting them to temporary huts that could offer them some succour from the biting cold until their permanent houses are built. In his address to the country on October 23, nearly a month after the worst of monsoon disasters, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli directed the agencies concerned to prioritise the task of assessing damages and making temporary huts for the displaced people. In the same address, he conceded that government bodies hadn’t even assessed damages from the earthquakes that struck Jajarkot, Rukum West, Bajhang, Doti and Bajura a year ago, let alone carry out reconstruction work. The government had announced a total of Rs50,000 in two instalments to build temporary houses for those displaced in the quakes. According to the state-run newspaper The Rising Nepal, the people of Jajarkot district are yet to get the second instalment.Last winter, elderly people, children, pregnant women and those with chronic health problems suffered a lot in Jajarkot as the quake survivors had to live under flimsy tents for months due to the delay in reconstruction and rehabilitation works. When the mountainous districts witnessed rains during the winter, cold-related ailments including pneumonia caused serious problems, especially for small kids and elderly people. Owing to what can only be described as government apathy, hundreds of those displaced by natural disasters years ago can be seen staying under makeshift huts on river banks or in forest areas in various parts of the country.The problem is not always lack of resources. Mismanagement and the government’s failure to properly and timely mobilise available resources is also a reason behind the victims’ sorry plight. For instance, 77 institutional and individual donors have contributed over Rs1.87 billion to the Prime Minister’s Natural Disaster and Rescue Fund as of last week. Even in the past, disaster victims would be shivering under makeshift structures while the government would be sitting on the money donated in their name.As Nepal is vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, floods, glacial lake outbursts and lightning, relevant agencies must be well equipped to help the needy people on time. The situation won’t improve unless there are mandatory provisions with strict timelines to accomplish vital tasks such as assessing damages, shifting the displaced people to temporary huts, distributing money to build permanent houses and for rehabilitation. In the process, the role and responsibility of provinces and local units can be broadened. Also, by coming to the help of the people in times of crisis, the provincial and local governments have an opportunity to prove their relevance as self-governing entities. \nPresident Ramchandra Poudel has appointed two new justices to Nepal’s Supreme Court.Acting upon the recommendation of the Judicial Council and following the approval from the Parliamentary Hearing Committee, President Poudel appointed Nripadhwaj Niraula and Nityananda Pandey as justices of the Supreme Court.The appointments were confirmed on Sunday, as stated by Shailaja Regmi Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Office of the President. The decision was made under Article 129, Clause (2) of the Constitution of Nepal, which grants the President authority to appoint Supreme Court justices based on the Judicial Council's recommendation.Prior to their appointments, Niraula served as Chief Judge at Patan High Court, while Pandey held the same role at the Tulsipur High Court.The Parliamentary Hearing Committee, on November 8, endorsed the names of Niroula and Pandey as Supreme Court justices.The Judicial Council nominated them as Supreme Court justices on September 27. Niroula and Pandey are currently chief judges at the Patan High Court and the Tulsipur High Court, respectively. \nThe COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan’s capital Baku will be among the highest-profile multilateral events attended by Taliban administration officials since they took control in Kabul after 20 years of fighting Nato-backed forces.The UN has not allowed the Taliban to take up Afghanistan’s seat at the General Assembly, and Afghanistan’s government is not formally recognised by UN member states, largely due to the Taliban’s restrictions on women’s education and freedom of movement.Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said officials from the National Environmental Protection Agency had arrived in Azerbaijan to attend the COP conference. The Taliban took over the agency when they returned to power as US-led forces withdrew.Taliban officials have taken part in UN-organised meetings on Afghanistan in Doha, and Taliban ministers have attended forums in China and Central Asia in the past two years.But the UN Framework Convention on Climate Changes Bureau of the COP has deferred consideration of Afghanistan’s participation since 2021, in effect freezing the country out of the talks.Afghan NGOs have also struggled to attend climate negotiations in recent years.Host Azerbaijan invited the Afghan environment agency officials to COP29 as observers, enabling them to “potentially participate in periphery discussions and potentially hold bilateral meetings,” a diplomatic source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Because the Taliban are not formally recognised within the UN system as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, the source said, the officials cannot receive credentials to take part in the proceedings of full member states.Azerbaijan’s presidency declined to comment.The Taliban has closed schools and universities to female students over the age of around 12. It also announced a set of wide-ranging morality laws this year that require women to cover their faces in public and restrict their travel outside the home without a male guardian.The Taliban says it respects women’s rights in accordance with its interpretation of Islamic law.Afghanistan is considered one of the countries worst affected by climate change.Flash floods have killed hundreds this year, and the heavily agriculture-dependent country has suffered through one of the worst droughts in decades. Many subsistence farmers, who make up much of the population, face deepening food insecurity.Some advocates have criticised international isolation of the Taliban, saying it only hurts the Afghan people.“Afghanistan is one of the countries that is really left behind on the needs that it has,” said Habib Mayar, deputy general secretary of the g7+, an intergovernmental organisation of countries affected by conflict.“It is a double price that they are paying,” Mayar said. “There is lack of attention, lack of connection with the international community, and then there are increasing humanitarian needs.” \nThe Supreme Court has declined to issue an interim order regarding the Nepal Premier League (NPL), which the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) is set to organise.A single bench led by Justice Hari Prasad Phuyal heard the petition concerning the NPL and rejected the request for an interim order.Earlier, Aamir Akhtar, on behalf of Zora Sports Management Pvt Ltd, had filed a case with CAN and its central committee as defendants. Akhtar argued that he held the franchise rights to the NPL for 10 years, thereby claiming CAN should not be allowed to organise the league.The NPL, organised by CAN, is scheduled to commence in Kathmandu on November 30, featuring eight franchise teams. \nDozens of people were killed and wounded in an Israeli strike on a house in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip at dawn on Sunday, Palestinian medics said.Footage circulating on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed about a dozen bodies wrapped in blankets and laid on the ground at a hospital. Residents said the building that was hit had housed at least 30 people.The official Palestinian news agency WAFA and Hamas media put the number of people killed at 32. There was no immediate confirmation of the tally by the territory’s health ministry.The Civil Emergency Service says its operations have been halted by an ongoing Israeli raid into two towns and a refugee camp in northern Gaza that began on October 5. It could not provide a figure for those killed in the attack.Israel says it sent forces into Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in the north of the enclave to fight Hamas militants waging attacks from there and to prevent them from regrouping. It says its troops have killed hundreds of militants in those areas since the new offensive began.In Gaza City, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Sabra neighbourhood killed Wael Al-Khour, an official at the Welfare Ministry, and seven other members of his family including his wife and children on Sunday, medics and relatives said.The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports on the strike in Jabalia and in the Sabra neighbourhood.Efforts to conclude a ceasefire between the two warring sides have so far stalled, with Israel and Hamas trading blame. Hamas wants an agreement that ends the war and a prisoner-for-hostages deal, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war will only stop once Hamas is eradicated.Qatar, which has been seeking to negotiate a ceasefire along with Egypt and the US, has told Hamas and Israel it will stall its efforts until both sides show “willingness and seriousness” to resume talks, its foreign ministry said on Saturday.The three nations have been working for months on fruitless talks between the warring sides in Gaza and any disengagement from that process could further complicate efforts to reach a deal.There was no official response from Hamas or Israel.The war erupted when Hamas gunmen attacked Israeli communities on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and seizing another 253 hostages, by Israeli tallies. Israel's military campaign has levelled much of Gaza and killed around 43,500 Palestinians, Palestinian health officials say. \nUkraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 34 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the start of the war in 2022, forcing flights to be diverted from three of the city's major airports and injuring at least one person.Russian air defences destroyed another 36 drones over other regions of Western Russia in three hours on Sunday, the defence ministry said.“An attempt by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack using an airplane-type drones on the territory of the Russian Federation was thwarted,” the ministry said.Russia’s federal air transport agency said the airports of Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovsky diverted at least 36 flights but then resumed operations. One person was reported injured in Moscow region.Moscow and its surrounding region, with a population of at least 21 million people, is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in Europe, alongside Istanbul.For its part, Russia launched a record 145 drones overnight, Ukraine said. Kyiv said its air defences downed 62 of those. Ukraine also said it attacked an arsenal in the Bryansk region of Russia, which reported 14 drones had been downed in the region.Unverified video posted on Russian Telegram channels showed drones buzzing across the skyline.The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war and Donald Trump was elected 47th president of the United States.Trump, who takes office in January, said during campaigning that he could bring peace in Ukraine within 24 hours, but has given few details on how he would seek to do this.When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Trump to congratulate him on his presidential election victory, Tesla CEO and Trump supporter Elon Musk joined the call, according to media reports. Musk owns SpaceX, which provides Starlink satellite communication services that are vital for Ukraine’s defence effort.Moscow ‘Umbrellas’Kyiv, itself the target of repeated mass drone strikes from Russian forces, has tried to strike back against its vastly larger eastern neighbour with repeated drone strikes against oil refineries, airfields and even the Russian strategic early-warning radar stations.While the 1,000 km (620 mile) front has largely resembled grinding World War One trench and artillery warfare for much of the war, one of the biggest innovations of the conflict has been drone warfare.Moscow and Kyiv have both sought to buy and develop new drones, deploy them in innovative ways, and seek new ways to destroy them - from using farmers' shotguns to advanced electronic jamming systems.Moscow has developed a series of electronic “umbrellas” over Moscow, with additional advanced internal layers over strategic buildings, and a complex web of air defences which shoot down the drones before they reach the Kremlin at the heart of the Russian capital.Both sides have turned cheap commercial drones into deadly weapons while ramping up their own production. Soldiers on both sides have reported the visceral fear of drones - and both sides have used macabre video footage of fatal drone strikes in their propaganda.Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding rigours of the war, has called Ukrainian drone attacks that target civilian infrastructure such as nuclear power plants “terrorism” and has vowed a response.Moscow, by far Russia’s richest city, has boomed during the war, buoyed by the biggest defence spending splurge since the Cold War.There was no sign of panic on Moscow’s boulevards. Muscovites walked their dogs while the bells of the onion-domed Russian Orthodox churches rang out across the capital. \nRepublicans on Saturday were close to clinching control of the US House of Representatives, a critical element for President-elect Donald Trump to advance his agenda when he returns to the White House in January.With votes still being counted from the Nov. 5 general election, Republicans had won 213 seats in the 435-member House, according to Edison Research, which projected on Saturday night that Representative Dan Newhouse had enough votes to keep Republican control of Colorado’s 3rd congressional district.Republicans need to win five more seats to keep control of the House and they already have enough victories to wrest control of the US Senate from Democrats, though Edison Research projected late on Friday that Democratic US Senator Jacky Rosen won reelection in Nevada.Edison Research said Democrats have won 205 seats so far, including projecting on Saturday that Representative Greg Stanton in Arizona had won re-election. Democrats would need to win 13 of the remaining 17 seats to take control.With Trump’s victory in the presidential election and Republican winning control of the Senate, keeping hold of the House would give Republicans sweeping powers to potentially ram through a broad agenda of tax and spending cuts, energy deregulation and border security controls.Most of the remaining 17 House races are in competitive districts in Western states where the pace of vote counting is typically slower than in the rest of the country.Nine of the seats are currently held by Republicans and eight by Democrats. Fourteen seats were widely seen as competitive ahead of the election.Republican senators will decide next week who will serve as the party’s leader in the Senate in 2025 with John Thune, John Cornyn and Rick Scott vying for the job. On Saturday, Senators Bill Hagerty and Rand Paul endorsed Scott over the more senior Thune and Cornyn, who have been viewed as favorites.Cornyn vowed late on Saturday that if he wins he will keep the Senate in session until Trump’s cabinet is confirmed.“No weekends, no breaks. Democrats can cooperate in the best interest of the country, or continue the resistance, which will eventually be ground down,” he wrote on X. \nNepal Police on Sunday arrested former minister for internal affairs and law of Koshi Province Lilaballabh Adhikari from Biratnagar. Adhikari, who is accused of human trafficking, was apprehended after receiving permission from the court.According to sources at the Ministry of Home Affairs, Adhikari is being brought to Kathmandu on an aircraft shortly.On Saturday, his party CPN-UML suspended Adhikari from the party responsibilities following allegations of involvement in a human trafficking case.The controversy emerged when Adhikari, along with three other individuals, was sent back from Tokyo after being flagged by Japanese immigration due to suspicious documentation. Adhikari, who reportedly bypassed required travel protocols, subsequently resigned from his ministerial post amidst mounting ethical concerns.Nepal Police’s initial findings show that those who allegedly forged passports and went to Japan with Adhikari had paid over Rs1 million each to attend an event in Tokyo.Adhikari departed for Japan on October 29 without informing the authorities concerned to attend an event organised by the Tokyo Metropolitan.The other three individuals who accompanied him were detained for investigation by the police, but Adhikari had avoided arrest by presenting his ministerial identification.Adhikari, a lawyer by profession, represents Morang Constituency 2(b) and has served multiple terms in the provincial assembly.Organising a press meet immediately after tendering his resignation from the ministerial position, he claimed that he wasn’t involved in any illegal activity. \nTens of thousands of people demonstrated in the eastern Spanish city of Valencia on Saturday over regional authorities’ handling of devastating floods that killed more than 220 people in one of Europe’s worst natural disasters for decades.In the latest demonstration over the floods, protesters filled the centre of Valencia demanding the resignation of regional government leader Carlos Mazon and chanting “Killers!”.“Our hands are stained with mud, yours with blood,” read one banner. Some demonstrators dumped dirty boots outside the government building while others plastered it with mud.Residents in stricken areas accuse Mazon of issuing an alert too late, at 8 p.m. on Oct. 29, well after water was already pouring into many nearby towns and villages.The Valencian leader has said he would have issued an earlier alarm earlier if authorities had been notified of the seriousness of the situation by an official water monitoring body. Mazon did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.“We want to show our indignation and anger over the poor management of this disaster which has affected so many people,” said Anna Oliver, president of Accio Cultural del Pais Valenciano, one of about 30 groups that organised the protest.Though the demonstration was largely peaceful, police charged stone-throwing protesters at one point and objects hurled at the city council building caused minor damage.Following days of storm warnings from the national weather service from Oct. 25 onward, some municipalities and local bodies raised the alarm much earlier than the regional government.For example, Valencia University told its staff on Oct. 28 not to come to work. Several town halls suspended activities, shut down public facilities and told people to stay home.Weather service AEMET raised its threat level for heavy rains in the area to a red alert at 7:36 a.m. on Oct. 29.Nearly 80 people are still missing in what is the most deadly deluge in a single European country since floods in Portugal in 1967 killed around 500. \nWith Donald Trump returning to the White House, there are concerns over how his second term will shape the US foreign policy at large. And what will be its South Asia policy and by extension an outlook towards Nepal?Trumps’ ‘America First’ policy is seen as Washington’s possible drift towards isolationism but his South Asia policy could be guided by his closeness and personal bond with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Strengthening strategic ties between New Delhi and Washington and the evolution of Beijing-Washington ties are other factors to watch out, observers say.Former Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey said Nepal’s relations with the United States will remain unchanged irrespective of who enters the White House—a Republican or a Democrat.Nepal and the United States forged diplomatic relations on April 25, 1947, becoming only the second country to do so after the UK. Nepal established its embassy in Washington DC on February 3, 1958, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On August 6, 1959, the American Embassy in Kathmandu was set up. A number of Nepal’s honorary consuls are stationed in various US cities and a large number of Nepali nationals now live and work in the country.A Republican occupied the White House when Nepal and the US established diplomatic relations, said Pandey. Also, when Nepal opened its embassy in Washington DC and the US did so in Kathmandu, a Republican was at the helm. “When King Mahendra addressed the joint session of US Congress in 1960, a Republican president was in power. Later, when he travelled to the United States in 1967, a Democratic president governed the country. Then, when King Birendra paid a state visit to the US in 1983, there was a Republican president,” said Pandey. “This suggests that the US policy towards Nepal has been stable and smooth.”Though Nepal-US relations have been changing for the better, during Trump’s first presidency between January 20, 2017 and January 20, 2021, bilateral ties took a dip due to the controversy over accepting the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s $500 million grant.The MCC became controversial in Nepal and stirred up debates. After Washington’s repeated clarifications that MCC is not aligned with the US’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and introduction of the 12-point interpretive declaration, the US grant was ratified by the House of Representatives in February 2022. Nepal has also invested $197 million in the MCC projects.During Trump’s first term as president, the American request for Nepal to join the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and State Partnership Program also caused unease in Nepal. Successive governments have clarified that Nepal does not intend to join these two US initiatives.Nepal’s former permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva Sambhu Ram Simkhada hopes that relations between Nepal and the US will remain good in Trump’s second term.“But it is more important to see how relations between powerful countries evolve during Trump’s second term,” he said.In Trump’s first term, some of his decisions like withdrawing from the Paris climate pact, the World Health Organisation, ending US support for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and blocking abortion rights had an impact on Nepal as well. Nepal is looking for compensation for the damages from adverse effects of climate change, which is triggered mainly by the greenhouse gases emitted by large industrial countries.Nepal must tread carefully, said Pandey, especially with the US citizens electing a decisive president who wants no delays in action. Like Simkhada, former minister Pandey also believes that evolving ties between the US, India and China will shape Washington’s policy towards Kathmandu.Nepal is on the strategic radars of India, China and the US, said Pandey. “Therefore, it should be careful while navigating its relations with these three powers. Nepal should maintain healthy relations with both India and China.”Nepal should not be tempted to use its ties with one neighbour against the other, Pandey added.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has yet to issue a congratulatory message on Trump’s election but President Ramchandra Paudel and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli have congratulated the president-elect.In his congratulatory message on Wednesday, Paudel expressed confidence that the Nepal-US relationship would be further strengthened during Trump’s second term.Prime Minister Oli on Thursday stated that Trump’s return to the Oval Office is a historic chapter in American history. Oli also said that he looks forward to deepening Nepal-US relations, fostering mutual prosperity and cooperation under Trump’s leadership.“It would be interesting to see how the US relations with India and China evolve,” said Simkhada. “That will have a big bearing on Nepal-US relations, perhaps as much as Nepal’s own relations with these three powers.” Former Nepali ambassador to the United States Arjun Karki said that the US policy towards Nepal will remain unchanged despite changes in the US government as Kathmandu has already worked with the Trump administration. Karki served as Nepal’s ambassador to the United States during Trump’s first term. “But yes, some global policies he pursues might impact Nepal.”“In his first term, Trump cut or downsized the US funds in areas like climate change, access to the abortion rights, health, and financial assistance to the World Health Organization. If he continues on the same path, Nepal will be affected,” said Karki, who served as Nepal’s US envoy from 2015 to 2021.Karki believes the US policy towards Russia and Israel will change but not so much its outlook towards China. “Perhaps some of Trump’s interventionist policies might even be to Nepal’s benefit,” he adds.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \nIt’s now all but certain: Oli will visit China in early December. This trip would mark a break from the tradition of Nepali prime ministers making their first “official” visit to India. There is nothing to quibble about, as flying to New Delhi first is merely an unwritten custom, not a formal requirement. So, Oli’s planned visit to Beijing isn’t a breach of any protocol; rather, it could set a precedent.Yet questions have lingered over why Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hasn’t extended an invitation to Oli, sparking speculation that Oli began planning a trip to China after waiting in vain for an invite from New Delhi. In some circles, there is a belief that Oli’s ascension to power is not to India’s liking. Some within Oli’s orbit have remarked that certain foreign powers have been trying to unseat the government without providing evidence to support this claim.Oli and India amid global shiftsEven Oli can’t deny that his past actions and rhetoric have frequently irked New Delhi. While his assertive stance may have earned him a “nationalist” image among sections of Nepali society, it has also placed him in India’s bad books. Attempts at rapprochement have been met with a cold shoulder, leaving him to orchestrate his return to power. Since the 2022 elections, he’s worn many hats: Coalition partner, opposition leader, and now, once again, prime minister.Yet India appears unconvinced. While Modi’s government rolled out the red carpet for Arzu Rana Deuba of the Nepali Congress, who serves as foreign minister in Oli’s Cabinet, it has yet to extend an invitation to Oli, despite him being in office for over 100 days and even meeting Modi in New York in September. Meanwhile, Oli’s government has repeatedly signalled its keenness to host Modi in Nepal, failing to elicit any concrete response.Then, has India abandoned its long-standing tradition of hosting the Nepali prime minister soon after a new government is formed? If so, this raises broader questions about India’s much-touted “Neighborhood First” policy. Extending an invitation to Oli could have shown goodwill and reinforced New Delhi’s proclamation that “Nepal is a special priority partner.”Amid rapid geopolitical shifts, India may have set its sights on bigger platforms and larger roles in the world order, but it would do well not to ignore its neighbours or treat them based on the government of the day. On Nepal’s part, its foreign policy is becoming increasingly complex, extending beyond bilateral ties with India and China, as Sino-Indian and Sino-American tensions and interests intersect more with a growing US influence in Asia amid shifting global dynamics. Oli, as the incumbent, needs to tread carefully. His role demands deft management of relations with India and China while also recalibrating Nepal’s strategic posture in a complex and evolving geopolitical landscape.The northern nexusNepal’s communist leaders often lean towards, or appear to align with, China when they want to “send a message” to India. Oli is no exception. Even before an official invitation was extended, extensive media reports outlined Oli’s potential agenda for the trip, including efforts to secure a loan waiver for the Pokhara International Airport and agreements on some Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. The Chinese, who often practise quiet diplomacy, have yet to comment on Oli's planned visit. Meanwhile, the BRI remains a contentious issue in Nepal, with Beijing eager to reframe all China-funded projects under its banner. Oli currently leads a strong government with support from the Nepali Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Congress’s position on the BRI and other forms of assistance is clear—grants are acceptable but loans are not. If Oli avoids pushing too aggressively with China, potentially unsettling his coalition partner, his position remains secure. Deeper engagement with China could bring valuable infrastructure projects, but it also raises concerns about long-term dependency and potential political leverage. It’s up to Nepali leaders—especially Oli—to negotiate beneficial terms.The Nepali public is divided on Chinese aid: Some see it as a counterbalance to dependence on India, while others fear it might lead to undue influence from the north. Both views have merit and flaws, making it crucial for the current leadership to steer Nepal’s foreign policy in a direction that serves and safeguards the country’s interests.While Nepal could benefit from its northern neighbour’s economic and technological might, it is not in a position to ignore its southern neighbour, with whom it not only shares historical, cultural and people-to-people ties but also carries out a majority of its trade.The catchDiplomacy often works best when conducted quietly. Oli’s “preparations” to visit Beijing could have been kept under wraps until concrete plans were in place. The premature leak of his intentions by his circle allows room for speculation that this may have been a tactic to pressure India.While China seeks to expand its influence in Nepal, it remains cautious about provoking India to the point of confrontation. And India, too, appears hesitant to employ its usual political manoeuvres in Nepal, particularly after recent setbacks in its immediate neighbourhood. As the Sino-Indian relations show signs of thawing, Nepal stands to benefit from reduced regional tension. Oli would be wise to avoid antagonising either neighbour.Nonetheless, Oli has an uncanny inclination to critique India. While he uses backchannels to re-engage with New Delhi, his public jabs at India reveal his characteristic defiance. If his plan to visit China is driven more by spite than by a balanced foreign policy strategy, he risks making a strategic misstep.Even after over 100 days in office, Oli’s performance has been dismal on various domestic fronts. Neither Oli nor his coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, has been able to justify the formation of this “stable” government.With his political legacy on the line, Oli has an opportunity to “achieve something meaningful” as prime minister, and he should approach foreign policy with a view toward lasting impact.Foreign policy is certainly a tough balancing act for a country like Nepal, sandwiched between the world’s two large economies. In an era of fluid geopolitics, future Nepali leaders will likely face further challenges in balancing relations with both neighbours. Nepali politicians’ failure to pursue a cohesive and balanced foreign policy has already tarnished Nepal’s international image.In the intricate world of foreign policy, there’s little room for grandstanding. And, adventurism can backfire. Oli has a unique chance to set a precedent for independent, balanced diplomacy that could serve as a model for the country and his successors.His China sojourn could go beyond simply breaking the so-called custom of prioritising one neighbour over the other; it might even pave the way for a new approach. But this must be done in the best interest of Nepal, not to satisfy personal pride or vanity. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is known for his supposed ability to implement decisions and accomplish the tasks he takes up even at the cost of becoming unpopular.But a series of events after he became prime minister in mid-July tells a different story.In the three and half months since he assumed office at Singha Durbar, the prime minister has been compelled to backtrack on a couple of his plans or postpone them.In the first week of September, Prime Minister Oli pushed a plan to remove Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar from the post and elect a lawmaker from the ruling Nepali Congress in her place. According to multiple leaders privy to the development, by electing a Congress lawmaker as deputy speaker, Oli wanted to strengthen relations with the major coalition partner Congress, which has more seats than the prime minister’s party, the CPN-UML, in the House of Representatives. Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba has a special interest in getting a lawmaker from his party elected to the post, as deputy speaker is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which nominates members and heads of constitutional bodies.The prime minister on September 9 convened a meeting of the ruling parties and floated a proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar and sought a green signal from the coalition partners to his plan.After the meeting, party leaders told the Post that Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office. Deputy Speaker Magar courted controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role. On February 26 last year, Magar wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting a visa interview for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she was under pressure to step down.Last month, the prime minister held several meetings and consultations with a plan to introduce an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act-2017 with an intention to facilitate party splits. This plan also drew widespread criticism as leaders from various political parties and independent observers accused the prime minister of plotting splits of fringe political parties with a plan to merge their dissident groups into the UML.His proposal to introduce ordinance was reportedly floated in order to merge the Ashok-Rai led Janata Socialist Party and the dissident group from the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), which in turn would make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives.As the major coalition partner, the Congress, reportedly did not back his proposal to introduce the ordinance, Oli was again pushed to the back seat.These are just a few cases in point. Oli from the start of this tenure has struggled to assert his authority.Professor of political science Krishna Pokharel assesses that there may have been an understanding between Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli to arrest Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane, who was accused of misappropriating cooperative funds, and issuing an ordinance related to political parties.Pokharel believes that the two leaders might have reached a deal to accomplish the two goals—bring an ordinance to facilitate the split of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which was formed in 2021 after breaking away from the UML; and arrest Lamichhane. Lamichhane, the immediate past home minister, had reportedly tried to arrest Congress chief Deuba’s spouse (current foreign minister) Arzu Rana Deuba, on charges of involvement in the Bhutanese refugee scam. “While the wish of the Congress chief was fulfilled, the interest of the UML chair and the prime minister was not,” Pokharel said. However, the UML leaders don’t buy this argument. Vice-chair Yubaraj Gyawali said that the government under UML leadership has just completed its 100 days, so it is too early to judge its performance. “There are many good initiatives taken by this government whose results will come in due course,” Gyawali told the Post. “Everything that the head of the government wants cannot be achieved in such a short period, but that does not mean his influence has waned.” But some political analysts say that Oli’s standing has declined since he became prime minister this time with the support of Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Oli dismisses those who claim his influence has gone down. While addressing the symposium on ‘Role of former security personnel in National Security and Development’ organised by the Nepal National Former Army and Police Association on October 27, Oli rubbished claims that his influence was steadily decreasing.“Those who claim my charm has decreased will know the reality in the 2027 election,” Oli said.Sarita Bhusal, a UML lawmaker, said a mistaken impression might have been created among the people. “Sometimes there are constraints to leading a coalition government,” Bhusal told the Post.Gyawali, a vice chair of the UML, agrees. “Earlier, Oli became prime minister with the support of smaller parties. But this time, he has the backing of the largest party in Parliament, so it is not easy for him to do all that he wants.” Oli first headed a coalition government after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. When he became prime minister again in 2018 after the 2017 election, his party was the largest in the House. He became prime minister with the support of the Maoist Centre, which was his coalition partner during his previous stint as well.The Congress publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, said his party has been giving full support to the Oli government. “Our party has not opposed any government programme that is good for the country,” Bishwakarma told the Post. “We only caution the government on issues that may cause public backlash.”This government was formed in the spirit of a seven-point agreement between the two parties, and achieving those objectives must be its primary focus, Bishawakarma said. Of late, Oli has also faced criticism from within his party. Some UML leaders publicly opposed his recent decision to accept a donation from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of Bhatbhateni Supermarket, for the construction of the party’s head office. Experts see it as a sign of his decreasing hold in the party organisation. Although party’s standing committee member Binda Pandey and central committee member Ushakiran Timilsina protested against it publicly, other party leaders are also reportedly dissatisfied with Oli’s decision.Bhim Rawal, who contested the election for chair against Oli during the party’s 10th general convention in Chitwan in November 2021, also criticised Oli for accepting the donation. Sidelined by Oli, Rawal is currently inactive in the party. Even leaders like Gokul Baskota, who used to be a staunch Oli supporter, couldn’t back him on the deal with businessman Gurung.In an interview with Image television, Baskota said, “The UML cannot accept Gurung’s donation and carry his old baggage.” On October 28, the Supreme Court issued an interlocutory interim order barring the ruling party, UML, from building any structure on the land donated by businessman Gurung. A single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel said the UML-Gurung donation deal was illegal prima facie, putting Oli further on the defensive. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nAuthor Thomas Bell unveiled his second book, ‘Human Nature’, at a launch event hosted by KathaSatha at the Patan Museum on Saturday. The programme commenced with a conversation between Bell and Aditya Adhikari, a former journalist and columnist for the Kathmandu Post. In his conversation with Bell, Adhikari said, “The book explores the hills and mountains surrounding Kathmandu, offering much more than a travelogue. Bell has written about cultural history and the environment based on his research.” Having spent decades in Nepal, Bell’s new book blends travelogue with folklore, literature, art, and anthropology. It addresses topics like the impact of British Imperialists and external pressures on the environment.“The book is divided into four sections, featuring my four different walks through the Himalayas, each during a different season,” said Bell. In the first section, Bell delves into the theme of migration, covering various issues such as the moving of the Gurkhali soldiers, labour migrations to the Middle East, and the migration of birds, animals, and fish. He also touches on the arrival of the first settlers in the hills, Rai mythologies, and the shamanic histories of the landscapes. Similarly, the second section of the book details his journey to Dolpo. Adhikari remarked that he enjoyed reading Bell’s description of landscapes. The writer, however, mentioned, “I did not want to get too much into the whimsical description of nature, which was kind of challenging for me.”The final section documents Bell’s journey to Rara Lake, where he discusses the concept of wilderness. In his conversation with Adhikari, he said, “The idea of taming the wilderness is seen to be projected into the Himalayan region, due to which people were expelled from their homes.” He gave the example of Rara Lake, where residents were displaced to transform the area into the national park it is today. “On writing this book, I cast my net as far as it could reach because the subject of social issues is so expansive.” Bell mentioned that he relied on historian Mahesh Chandra Regmi's research and cited author Shanker Koirala as a reference from his work ‘Khaireni Ghat’. Bell also read a brief excerpt from his book and answered questions from the audience. In answering the audience queries, Adhikari emphasised that ‘Human Nature’ is mainly written for a Nepali audience, aiming to resonate more with local than international readers.Guests, including actress Manisha Koirala and writers Amish Raj Mulmi, Rishi Amatya, and Dia Yonzon, attended the event.  \nEveryone is after contentment in life. Whether studying, working, or earning, our actions aim to achieve happiness. The desire for eternal happiness and peace is deeply rooted in human nature. ‘Ananda Samhita’ by Ghanashyam Khadka explores this universal pursuit: what happiness and sadness mean. It examines how people chase after happiness and suggests alternative approaches that might lead to fulfilment and inner peace.This book guides us to find peace and happiness within ourselves, independent of external or superficial influences. The author explains that people often chase happiness in ways that lead to disappointment. If happiness is dependent on fleeting moments, it isn’t true happiness. Instead, joy should be enduring and accessible of reason—if one can be happy without cause, nothing can take that joy away. Happiness and peace are ongoing states that come from within.The author suggests that sadness often arises from a lack of self-awareness. Happiness and sadness, he argues, aren’t the outcomes of events but rather our attitudes toward them. A positive approach to life can transform difficulties into opportunities, turning darkness into light and challenges into growth. Staying peaceful is an art; it doesn’t come by birth and can be achieved by preparation. The author explains everything in detail, helping readers grasp the content quickly. He uses relatable examples to bring depth to the ideas, encouraging readers to apply them to everyday life. This book contains questions and reflective activities that make us contemplate our lives. Khadka writes, “In the universe, we are very tiny; thus, stressing over minimal things and being sad is not worthy.” The book unfolds over 18 interconnected chapters, each guiding the reader to self-discovery and inner peace. Every chapter introduces a new concept and topic, which is also the chapter’s theme, building on the last and adding new layers. The author explains how the presence and absence of particular qualities or perspectives can shape our pursuit of peace, making each chapter a stepping stone toward achieving a more profound sense of contentment.The author has included different stories to bring the concepts to life, keeping readers engaged. These stories serve as relatable examples, making the ideas more memorable. For instance, he shares the story of a famous scientist, Albert Einstein, and his driver to illustrate how we naturally adopt traits from those we spend time with. This leads to his advice: surround yourself with people who inspire you, are intellectually curious, and are self-aware.While reading the book, I applied many suggested mindfulness practices and self-help tips. While philosophical books like this may not appeal to everyone, ‘Ananda Samhita’ engages readers with reflective activities at the end of each chapter, making them more interactive and applicable to daily life.Each activity encourages us to reflect on the chapter’s insights and integrate them into our daily lives. As I read through the activity guidelines and tried a few, it felt like meditating while listening to Prawachan. Yet, I struggled to concentrate and thoroughly follow the instructions. This experience made me realise that a calm, focused mindset is essential to truly absorb this book's wisdom and put its teachings into practice. Although reaching this level of immersion might seem unrealistic in our hectic lives, it’s precisely for this reason that the book was written.All the activities focus on positive self-talk and affirmations, which soothe the mind and heart, bring calmness, and build self-confidence. As the saying goes, “You become what you feed your mind.” We can move toward a positive life by practising positive affirmations and cultivating an optimistic inner dialogue.The writer advises that we should master our hearts rather than be ruled by them. He explains that true happiness and salvation remain out of reach if our hearts control us. By embracing our inevitable death, we can learn to value each moment, allowing us to live more fully in the present. This acceptance, he argues, leads to a deep awakening to life’s true worth.The author draws on the story of Siddhartha Gautam, who left his palace comforts upon realising death's inevitability. Gautam’s choice to renounce superficial pursuits underscores the importance of focusing on meaningful goals rather than allowing trivial distractions to sidetrack us. Life is uncertain, and by keeping this in mind, we can better appreciate its value and avoid wasting time on distractions that pull us away from our ultimate purpose, salvation.Moreover, the author backs the text with data, statistics, and insights from psychological theories by figures like Sigmund Freud, Carl Rogers, and Abraham Maslow, as well as scientific principles. He also incorporates Nepali proverbs and cultural sayings to ground complex ideas in relatable language. Khadka also talks about the teachings of Buddha and uses them as a reference. This blend of psychology, science, and spirituality creates a well-rounded and accessible framework for readers, making profound ideas easier to grasp.That said, this book may not resonate with everyone. As someone who doesn’t usually gravitate toward philosophical texts, I found ‘Ananda Samhita’ both challenging and thought-provoking. The author delves into philosophical, spiritual, and idealistic ideas that sometimes seem abstract or impractical yet carry profound meanings. While I respect the message about striving for peace and ending suffering permanently, I find it challenging to agree. In today’s fast-paced, highly competitive world, such ideals can feel out of reach and perhaps impractical for many.Additionally, the book introduces complex terms and concepts that, despite explanations, may still feel elusive to some readers. ‘Ananda Samhita’ is a thoughtfully researched book offering valuable insights into understanding our inner selves—something many overlook. The author’s engaging writing style captivates readers. The book also challenges our attachment to worldly possessions and questions how we perceive life, happiness, and sadness. Fresh perspectives in the text invite readers to reflect on their lives and guide them toward peace and happiness.Ananda SamhitaAuthor: Ghanashyam KhadkaYear: 2024Publisher: Alchemy PublicationPages: 231 \nThe next general elections are three years away, but political parties have already started devising strategies to secure victory.While all major parties are discussing ‘mission 84’ (election year 2084 BS, or 2027 AD), the CPN-UML is ahead of others in formulating strategies as much as it plans to collect private information on individual voters. In a bid to assess its strength, the ruling party has decided to find out the political affiliation of each voter.The country's second-largest party will send its volunteers to each household to find out the political leanings of the members. “Our local cadres know who our sympathisers are and who is associated with other parties. The study aims to find out the political inclination of those whose affiliations are not known,” Bishal Bhattarai, a UML politburo member and member of the party’s Organisation Department, told the Post. Such study has already started in local units where byelections are being held next month. The voting is taking place for 44 positions including mayors and chiefs of rural municipalities in 33 local units across the seven provinces on December 1. The seats had turned vacant due to deaths and resignations, and other reasons. The party plans to conduct the nationwide study for two months, from mid-February to mid-April next year. As per the schedule, the party’s central office will receive the reports from the local level by the end of the current fiscal year—mid-July.Party leaders claim the survey is for the party’s internal purposes to evaluate its strengths. “Based on the report, the party will devise its strategy to strengthen its positions wherever it is weak. Such surveys are done in other countries as well,” Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the party, told the Post.However, political experts don’t think the matter is as simple as the UML is trying to project. Krishna Khanal, professor of political science, said in principle there is nothing wrong with conducting surveys to collect information to devise strategies to mobilise party. “However, in a country like ours where the government’s treatment of people often depends upon their party affiliation, the ruling party studying the common people’s political affiliation is a serious matter. It will not only intimidate ordinary people, but also raises concerns that state machinery could be misused to bring neutral voters into the UML’s camp,” he told the Post.Some political analysts see this move as an intrusion into personal matters. Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, collecting information of individual party affiliation is not an acceptable act in democracy. “The UML is trying to adopt a radical communist strategy. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) applied a similar strategy to remain in power for long,” he told the Post.Not just the radical communists but right wing forces in India too are embracing a similar strategy to turn election results in their favour. During every election, from the municipal to Lok Sabha, India’s Bharatiya Janata Party appoints panna pramukhs (unit incharges), who are tasked with influencing voters at the household level.Every constituency is divided into blocks, with lists of voters from every 10 to 12 families. And a person called panna pramukh is assigned to pay special attention to the families of his/her designated area. Their job is to convince them to vote for the party. This strategy seems to have worked for the right-wing party, which won the elections for the third consecutive time in June. “It is not surprising to see that extremists, no matter whether they are right wing or left wing, adopt similar strategies,” said Pyakurel. The UML, which has seen a decline in the number of its organised cadres, wants to increase their numbers to at least one million which hovers around half that figure at present. It believes it can devise policy to increase its vote base based on the survey results. In the 2022 general elections, the country had 17.79 million registered voters.Pyakurel, however, doesn’t believe that the UML’s initiative is going to benefit it hugely during the elections. If his claims are anything to go by, swing voters have a significant share in Nepal and no single strategy by the UML is likely to guarantee results in the next general elections. Nepal is the country where pre-poll surveys are illegal although they are practiced elsewhere in the world. However, there is no restriction on a ruling party gathering information on people’s political affiliations. “The Election Commission must come forward to stop the UML’s move,” said Khanal, the professor.The UML leaders, however, say there is no need to ‘make a mountain out of a molehill’. “This is just the party’s internal survey. We are sensitive enough to individual freedom and the right to privacy,” said Bhattarai. \nPolitical parties have expedited their preparations for the by-elections slated for next month in various local units.The by-elections will be held on December 1 for various positions that went vacant due to various reasons after the local elections in 2022.As the Election Commission has fixed November 18 for filing the candidacy, parties are busy selecting their candidates for the 44 vacant seats ranging from the chief of the district coordination committees to the ward chairpersons.The voters from different local units will vote to elect two chiefs of the district coordination committees, chairpersons of two rural municipalities, four vice-chairs, one mayor, one deputy mayor and chairs of 34 wards. Votes will also be cast to elect chiefs of the district coordination committees in Okhaldhunga and Kailali, the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in Kathmandu, and the deputy mayor of Nalagad Municipality in Jajarkot.Similarly, the elections will be held to elect chairpersons of Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang and Mahabu Rural Municipality in Dailekh, and the vice-chairs of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality in Dolakha, Sarkegad Rural Municipality in Humla and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura.Additionally, elections will take place to elect ward chair positions in various local units including in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City and Kirtipur Municipality.The Local Level Election Act, 2016 envisions by-elections to fill vacant positions such as district coordination committee heads, vice-heads, rural municipality chairs, vice-chairs, mayors, deputy mayors, and ward chairs if their term has not expired and has more than a year left with for their term. The representatives in all the vacant positions were elected on May 13, 2022 with just half of their terms completed so far.Suman Ghimire, information officer at the commission, said the nominations can be filed during the office hours on November 17 and the list of candidates will be published by 6 pm the same day.Anyone who has an objection to the candidacy of any contestant can lodge the complaint the next day. Similarly, candidates will be allowed to withdraw their candidacies, if they wish so, by 1 pm on October 20.The final list of the candidates from all the vacant positions will be published the same day while the election symbols too will be allotted between 3 pm to 5 pm on the day.“Twenty-five parties have been registered in the commission to compete in the by-polls,” said Ghimire.According to the constitutional poll management body, the mayoral and deputy mayoral candidates can spend a maximum of Rs450,000, rural municipality chairs and vice-chairs are allowed to spend up to Rs350,000 while the aspirants for the district coordination committee chief and deputy can spend up to Rs50,000.Rs300,000 is the maximum amount the candidates for metropolitan city ward chairs can spend but the ceiling is Rs200,000 and Rs150,000 for the ward chairpersons of the municipality and rural municipality, respectively.The main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre) is ahead of other major parties in candidate selection. It has decided to field Shivsharan Maharjan, a professor by profession, for the vacant mayor's position in Kirtipur Municipality. It has picked Nimleki Sherpa for the vice-chairperson position in Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha. The third largest party has also finalised its candidates for the ward chairpersons in most of the local units where the by-polls are going to take place.The ruling CPN-UML has picked the contenders for by-elections in the local units from Kathmandu but is yet to decide for other parts. Surendra Manandhar, a UML central committee member, is the party’s mayoral candidate in Kirtipur. Laxmi Ratna Tuladhar will contest for chairperson of ward 16 of the Kathmandu Metropolis from the UML.Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the second largest party, said all the party’s candidates will be finalised within a couple of days.The Nepali Congress, on the other hand, has already received lists of the probable candidates from the respective local units but is yet to finalise the names. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which came into existence after the 2022’s local elections, is also preparing to contest the by-polls this time.All the parties, including those who had contested earlier polls forming pre-poll alliances, have announced they’d contest the upcoming elections independently. \nTwo ruling parties have formed a three-tier political mechanism—at the centre, in the provinces and in the districts—in order to facilitate the government of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML at the centre and to resolve any disputes at the provincial and district levels.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba will head the mechanism, according to a statement issued by the secretariat of the newly announced body on Wednesday. The first meeting of the mechanism was held on Tuesday. At the central level, they formed an eight-member team with four members from each party. Among them are the parties’ office bearers and ministers in the Oli Cabinet. However, in the provinces and districts, each party will have three representatives in the task force.The decision to form the joint mechanism is aimed at minimising the differences between the two parties, supporting the spirit of government formation agreed in mid-July when the parties came together, according to ruling party leaders.The development comes at a time when the popularity of the Oli government is dipping as it fails to revive the ailing economy, unlike what was promised in mid-July. The mechanism is also tasked with removing the obstacles to the two parties’ coalition so that it continues to govern until the elections in 2027. Formation of the mechanisms at provincial and district levels are said to be in the final stage.Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak are Congress members in the task force while UML senior vice-chairman Ishwar Pokhrel, General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel and deputy general secretary Bishnu Rimal are representing Oli.The decision was made on October 31, Rimal told the Post. The objectives of the mechanism are to support and facilitate the works of the three-tier government.Representatives from the two parties will lead the mechanism by turns. Khadka of the Congress will coordinate the meetings for a month from November 5. At the provincial level, Congress provincial party chief, incumbent chief minister or the parliamentary party leader (in case the party is not leading the provincial government) and the senior member of the provincial Cabinet will be members of the task force.From the UML, provincial party chair, provincial in-charge and parliamentary party leader will be members of the task force, said Rimal. At the district level, Congress party president and two office bearers will be the members.The UML district in-charge, party chair and secretary will be represented in the task force, according to Rimal.The political mechanism also announced the visit of Prime Minister Oli to China scheduled for December 2-6. But the government is yet to make a formal announcement of the visit. At the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, prime minister Oli is paying an official visit to China in December. As per the instructions of Prime Minister Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana will coordinate the visit. The task force will lay the groundwork for the visit , the statement added. Rana has already cancelled her scheduled trip to Baku, Azerbaijan where she was to attend the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference. President Ramchandra Paudel is leading the Nepali delegation in the UN climate change conference. The main objective of the three-tire mechanism is to assist and support the federal, provincial and local governments, said Rimal. The provincial and district level mechanisms will resolve disputes related to government functioning, he added. “The main purpose of the mechanisms is to convince people that the government will deliver and address their needs. The mechanism will help restore trust and hope and will solidify the Congress-UML alliance,” added Rimal.Leaders said that there is good working relations between the two parties at all three levels.“This government will complete its full term. The current political Oli-Deuba partnership is doing well as there is a high level of mutual trust,” said Rimal. He said the government would stay intact so long as the trust between Oli and Deuba remains intact and so long as the UML remains a united party. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nTen people were injured in a bus accident at Ghumaune in Kharipati of Bhaktapur district on Tuesday. Two are reportedly in critical condition.According to Pradeep Khatri, a traffic police inspector and chief of the District Traffic Police Range, the bus coming from Talakot of Changunarayan Municipality lost its control and hit a pole. The injured are undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital, police said. \nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nThe heavy rainfall in late September, which triggered floods and landslides in most parts of the country, caused a loss of Rs46.68 billion to Nepal’s economy, nearly three-fold more than the initial estimates.According to the preliminary loss and damage assessment report released by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority under the home ministry on Thursday, the floods and landslides from September 26 to 28 caused significant damage to the physical infrastructure sector, followed by the social and productive sectors.According to the report, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology reported that out of 222 rainfall measurement stations across Nepal, 77 recorded heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving over 200 millimetres in just 24 hours. Kathmandu experienced its highest rainfall on record, surpassing previous measurements set in 2002. The Tribhuvan International Airport station recorded 239.7 millimetres of rain, highlighting the intensity of the weather system affecting the region.More than 83 percent of the total economic losses were observed in the physical infrastructures, amounting to Rs38.92 billion.The report said that 41 roads and highways were damaged. The estimated cost of repairing and maintaining the roads and highway infrastructure is Rs27.98 billion. Blocked or damaged roads hinder transportation and supply chains, complicating relief efforts and economic recovery.In the hydropower sector, the damage to 26 facilities has caused an estimated loss of Rs30.18 billion. This loss has significantly hit energy supply, impacting residential and industrial consumers.Nepal’s electricity imports are likely to surge this winter due to the delay in the reconstruction of hydropower plants. The 456MW Upper Tamakoshi hydropower project, Nepal’s largest in operation, has failed to resume generation since late September. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, 980MW of output has been interrupted.Similarly, damage to 446 telecommunication units has resulted in a loss of R152.30 million.The destruction of 1,678 federal and provincial water supply and sanitation systems has led to an estimated loss of Rs5.90 billion. The report said that the loss affects access to clean water and poses health risks, particularly in the wake of disasters that often exacerbate waterborne diseases.Forty-four bridges sustained damage, resulting in an estimated financial loss of Rs1.04 billion. The report said the damage severely hampers connectivity and affects transportation and logistics in the region.The social sector has experienced profound impacts, particularly in housing and settlements. As per initial reports, 5,996 houses were destroyed, while 13,049 were damaged. This destruction has displaced 10,807 families, impacting 16,243 individuals who are now living in public shelters and facing challenges in finding basic amenities, according to the report.Six infrastructures were fully destroyed in the health sector, and 43 health facilities were partially destroyed. This limits access to essential medical services during a critical time when health needs are heightened due to potential post-disaster health crises. The education sector has not been spared either, with six schools destroyed completely and 136 schools partially damaged, further disrupting education for countless children.There were 249 deaths and 178 injuries, and 18 persons are still missing, the report said. The highest number of fatalities have been reported in Dhading, followed by Kavre and Lalitpur districts. In terms of human impact, Bagmati reported the highest fatalities at 208, while Koshi saw 20 deaths. The report said over 17,000 individuals were rescued, and more than 14,800 police personnel were deployed across affected areas. The most extensive police operations were in Kathmandu Valley and several districts in the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces. In the productive sector, agriculture and livestock incurred substantial losses. The assessment indicates that 65,380 hectares of agricultural land and 26,698 livestock have been affected, resulting in an estimated economic loss of Rs5.88 billion. The report said that the significant impact on agriculture threatens food security and farmers' livelihoods, who rely heavily on their land and livestock for income.Seven irrigation projects have been affected, leading to a loss of Rs1.35 billion. The destruction of irrigation infrastructure jeopardises crop yields and exacerbates the agricultural crisis after the disasters.This assessment underscores the vulnerabilities of the affected sectors and the importance of comprehensive disaster preparedness and resilience-building measures to mitigate future risks.Bagmati province reported the most extensive damage, with 424 houses destroyed and 743 impacted.Bagmati province reported the highest levels of destruction, with 4,414 houses fully destroyed and 7,157 partially destroyed, affecting more than 14,517 families and displacing 9,997 families. Kavrepalanchok district was particularly hit, with 3,121 houses fully destroyed and 5,749 partially destroyed.  \n\nKaski residents have started redeveloping the Krapu Kwholasothar trail, a circuit trek of religious and historical significance that remains unexplored.Kwhlosothar, located 3,283 metres above sea level, is in the southern part of Annapurna and Lamjung. It can be reached through Tangting, Sikles, Kori and Yangjakot of Kaski and Pasgaun, Bhujung, and Ghanpokhari of Lamjung.The shortest route is from Tangting.Locals say it's not just an ordinary trekking trail for it connects Kwholasothar, an ancient village believed to be Nepal's first Gurung or Tamu settlement, with ruins of an ancient town over 1500-1200 years old.Until half a decade ago, northern Kaski and Lamjung locals used this route to bring salt from Tibet.A decade ago, a joint research team from Cambridge University of the UK and the Central Department of Geology, Tribhuvan University, studied the artefacts in Kwhlosothar.Bed Bahadur Gurung, a Gandaki provincial assembly member and former chairman of Madi rural municipality, said the trail has many historical and archaeological sites for pilgrimages for the Tamu [Gurung] people and could be an important historical attraction for Nepali and foreign trekkers.Kwhlosothar or Kohla Sothar is divided into three villages—lower, middle and upper. ‘Sothar’, in the Gurung language, means three villages. Locals and researchers say Kohla Sonthar resembles the 15th-century Inca ruins of Machu Pichu in Peru. For a long time, people have been demanding the area be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.“There are many historical artefacts, including houses and palaces, in these three villages,” said Gurung.There are caves after walking two hours more from Kwhlosothar at the height 3,800. ‘The cave is known as ‘Chamsyo Nagra.’Gurung remembers when his father brought salt via Tangting of Kwhlosothar-Namun Bhanjyang-Larke Pass-Tibet route five decades ago.When the road from Pokhara-Butwal opened, the people of Kwhlosothar stopped going along the mountainous route.No human settlement exists above Tangting, but many sheep and buffalo herders can be found there.Gurung said that before the Annapurna Conservation Area Project was established in 1985, foreign trekkers used to go for camping treks. However, since the project didn’t include the Kwhlosothar, trekkers stopped hiking in the area and remained isolated.The project promoted Manang, Lamjung, Thorong Pass, Mustanf, Myagfi and Annapurna Base Camp, Ghandruk-Ghorepani, but Kwhlosothar remained in the shadows.In Tony Hagen's book Building Bridges to the Third World: Memories of Nepal 1950-1992, the Swiss geologist mentions his travel experience to Namun Bhanjyang, from the base of Machapuchhre to Sikles, Madi River, and Krupudanda.The trail was named the ‘Tony Hagen Trail’ after Bed Bahadur Gurung became the chairman of the Madi rural municipality to promote it.“This trail needs to be redefined to allow people to know the historical importance of the place. The provincial and local governments and tourism entrepreneurs of Lamjung, Manang, and Kaski all need to play an equal role in promoting the area,” said Gurung.The Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment of Gandaki Province, Nepal Tourism Board office in Pokhara have been allocating a budget to promote trails in Madi in Kaski, Kwhlosothar of Lamjung and Chame of Manang. But on the promotional front, locals say nothing has been done.The Gurung Tourism Entrepreneurs Association has named the trekking route the Gurung Heritage Trail.“As trekking trails have been losing charm due to haphazard road construction, such trails are still untouched by modern development,” said Kisham Kumari Gurung, president of the association.“These trails can draw high-end trekkers, which can create jobs and increase the income of people in the areas,” said the president. “Gurung heritage trail has a combination of nature and culture.”Gurung heritage trekking trail has been developed from Tangting to Danda-Tapro-Kwhlosothar-Thulilek-Thurju-Dudh Pokhari-Gurung Deurali-Danfe Kharka-Timang to Besi Sahar, said Bobar Jung Gurung, founding president of the association. The association's members and others recently conducted a 10-day trekking trail exploration and promotion programme.The trekking trail includes Kwhlosothar (3,283 metres); Thulilek, a vast grazing area (4,070 metres); Dudh Pokhari, a religious place (4,585 metres); Namun Bhanjyang (5,560 metres); and Danfe Kharka, a yak grazing area (3,862 metres).The Annapurna Conservation Area Project and the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal coordinated the exploration. The trekking can be completed in 12 days.As a motor road has been reached to Ghandruk and Ghorepani of Annapurna Conservation Area, reducing the charm of trekking, the new trekking trail can be an alternative, said Deepak Sapkota, a member of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal, Gandaki.“In this area, we can revive camping trekking, which can be a big draw for trekkers.” \nAs the deadline to reduce 50 percent of existing deaths and disabilities from snakebites nears, herpetologists and public health experts emphasise the urgency for awareness and training for local health workers to meet this crucial health goal.They say that fatalities and disabilities from snakebites can be significantly reduced if vulnerable populations, especially children, women and farmers residing in rural areas, are made aware of the risks.“Along with the awareness, health workers serving at the local level should be trained to deal with snakebite cases,” said Dr Sanjib Kumar Sharma, rector at BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “Trained health workers can manage snakebite cases more effectively than others.”Snakebite, which kills hundreds of people every year, is a major public health scare in Nepal.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. Snakebite incidents are also common among cattle, and thousands of farmers are affected every year.The government has committed to reducing 50 percent of deaths and disabilities through snakebite envenomation by 2030, the national target aligned with the World Health Organisation’s ‘Snakebite Roadmap’.“The government has created a pool of doctors and experts for snakebite case management and master trainers,” said Sharma. “Along with other measures, authorities concerned should also focus on launching an awareness drive, which will make a huge difference in lessening overall snakebite incidents.”Moreover, along with awareness, identifying the snake will also be crucial for case management. Health workers ask the public to take photos of snakes if they are able to after they are bitten, which helps them identify the snake so that they can start treatment accordingly.“Archive of the photos of snakes available in the country should be maintained so that health workers could identify the snakes’ types and start treatment accordingly,” said Dr Sunita Ghimire, a molecular biologist. “Risk of deaths and disabilities increases due to inability to identify the snakes’ type.”Experts say authorities must also strengthen health infrastructures to achieve the target. They say due to poor infrastructure in healthcare facilities—lack of doctors, anti-snake venoms, ventilator support systems, and kidney dialysis facilities—dozens of people die from snakebite every year.While health facilities are ill-equipped and short on anti-snake venom, many people in rural areas lack awareness and often consult shamans instead of physicians.Doctors say women who go to the fields to collect fodder, farmers who do plantations or harvest, and children who play in open areas are more vulnerable to snakebite.Poor people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats, their fodder.Experts say there should be a greater awareness drive on keeping the houses and surroundings clean, preventing children from playing in the bushes and avoiding walking at night. If absolutely necessary, people must use torchlights while walking in the dark.Nepal imports polyvalent antivenom from India, which is effective against four common species of snakes found in India: the common cobra, common krait, saw-scaled viper, and Russell’s viper. Saw-scaled viper has not yet been found in the country.Deaths from pit viper bites in the hills and mountainous regions have also risen recently. However, the antivenom made for other venomous snakes does not treat pit viper’s case. \nAt least 23 died, including one in Kathmandu Valley, and over 80 people have been infected with the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since June this year.The number of reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as tests were carried out only on those hospitalised patients after their conditions got severe, officials say.“The death rate from the Japanese encephalitis infection is the highest among the vaccine-preventable diseases,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division. “Relevant health agencies have been taking all necessary measures to prevent infection and deaths from the virus.”Cases of the deadly viral disease have been reported in 30 districts of six provinces except Karnali. What concerns health officials is the death rate rising alarmingly every year—around 29 percent in the current fiscal year. Fatality among children under 15 years is very high while complications from JE infection could cause permanent injuries to the brain and the nervous system.Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection, endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organisation, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to a half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Data from the health ministry show that less than 50 percent of the infected patients were found inoculated with the vaccine. Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines have been developed to prevent infection. Health officials, however, said that their attempts to convince development partners, including the World Health Organisation, for a mass JE vaccination campaign have not succeeded.“We have raised the issue several times with officials from the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation and requested their support,” said Lal. “But as of now, none of the agencies is convinced to support JE vaccination. Either the government has to decide and secure the funding source, or the aid agency should invest in the JE vaccination.”The National Immunisation Advisory Committee, an expert panel, has also not recommended mass JE vaccination despite the high mortality rate.“Vaccine does not help in controlling the ongoing epidemic,” said Dr Ramesh Kanta Adhikari, senior immunisation expert and a National Immunisation Advisory Committee member. “We are ready to carry out a feasibility study, hold review meetings and discussions with the concerned experts and stakeholders to recommend the JE vaccination campaign if the government decides the same.”In 2005, JE killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the Tarai districts. Nepal started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organisation officially issued prequalification certification, due to high rates of infection and deaths from the virus at the time.In the first phase, all populations of the highly affected four districts—Banke, Bardiya, Dang, and Kailali—were given the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into routine immunisation in 2015. Even then, people still die, and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.The Ministry of Health and Population said its attention has been drawn to the spread of a deadly virus that has killed around two dozen people and infected scores of others.“I have called a meeting of the officials concerned from the Family Welfare Division to discuss the issue on Friday,” said Pradip Paudel, minister for health and population. “We have taken the issue seriously and will make some decisions to prevent deaths and infections from the JE virus.”Public health experts say this is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk. Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity against future infections. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise avoiding mosquito bites, such as by using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or travels to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal. \nA team of senior health officials from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, who were deployed recently in Gandaki Province to assess the latest situation of the dengue spread, returned with complaints. Along with health workers serving at local bodies and provincial hospitals, elected representatives and local leaders of political parties, with whom they discussed, complained about exorbitant testing charges at private laboratories.“We are aware of the excessive prices being charged by private labs for dengue testing and held discussions about setting a maximum price but couldn't reach a decision,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “For the next dengue season, we would make a decision about slashing the testing charges.”Nepal has been witnessing a rapid surge in new cases of dengue infection in recent months. Health authorities, however, do not concede that the number of new dengue cases is rising alarmingly. Doctors say there could be dengue patients in almost all households, especially in the Kathmandu Valley and in major cities like Pokhara.Officials say that state-run health facilities do not charge for dengue testing, and they are aware of excessive charging by private labs despite the significant decline in the cost of rapid diagnostic test kits.“It cost less than 100 rupees for a rapid diagnostic testing kit, but private labs have been charging excessively,” an official at the Department of Health Services said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “Due to a lack of regulation, private labs and hospitals have been fleecing patients, and health officials have been avoiding making decisions to appease the private laboratories and hospitals.”Public health experts say that it was obvious for patients to bear brunt when the authorities concerned, including the health minister, focus on gaining popularity by announcing populist programmes that are not feasible to implement with existing resources.“Some hospitals have been charging up to Rs 3,000 for dengue tests,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “When the authorities forget their prime duties and fear antogonising private hospitals and labs, it is inevitable that patients will suffer.”Most state run health facilities and labs remained closed during Tihar holidays, which forced infected patients to seek services at private hospitals. Meanwhile, the Department of Health Services said that its attention has been drawn to the excessive charging for dengue testing at private labs.“I have noted the issue and will discuss it with the Health Ministry,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We will make some decisions regarding this issue.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.So far, only 12 people have died, and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often concealed the actual number of deaths and infections.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nIn rural Madhesh, where cultural norms and limited access to healthcare compound an already fragile health infrastructure, women’s sexual and reproductive health needs are often sidelined.For many women there, awareness of their own bodies and health needs remains a distant reality. Seeking help for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues is often a last resort.Seema Kumari Pasman, a 20-year-old from Karmahi village in Dhanusha who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy, is one such example.Married at 16 in 2019, she quickly became a mother of two children by 2022.After two child births, her menstrual complications worsened, yet she had no frame of reference to understand that what she was experiencing—menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding—was a medical condition.Pasman endured a year of painful, prolonged periods that she had been taught were simply part of a woman’s life—a burden, not a condition needing treatment.Daily chores became unbearable for her but those around her continued to dismiss her symptoms.One night in December 2023, after collapsing while fetching water from a hand pump, Pasman’s family rushed her to Janakpur Provincial Hospital.There, doctors diagnosed her with severe anaemia from untreated menorrhagia. “The doctors told me that if I had received earlier intervention, my suffering could have been prevented...but I only thought it was normal,” Pasman says.The culture of silence around SRH issues means that women like Pasman get help only when their conditions are critical.A 2018 study in the Journal of Health and Allied Sciences reported low awareness of SRH rights among 384 married Madheshi women in Sarlahi. Three-fifths were unaware of these rights, and the same proportion reported experiences of physical and dowry-related violence.Chandra Rekha Issar, a gynaecologist at Janakpur Provincial Hospital and assistant professor at the Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences (MIHS), says that for many women, the concept of openly talking about SRH—especially with male doctors—is almost unthinkable.In rural Madhesh, as part of ‘ghunghat pratha’, married women have limited interaction with unrelated men outside their family. They are often expected to wear a veil in front of everyone except their husbands and rarely go outside alone for extended periods.This restrictive environment creates a hesitation among women to discuss their SRH. When these women visit a gynaecologist and are assigned a male doctor, it often leads to discomfort.Health consultations can thus become uncomfortable or are avoided altogether, exacerbating a pattern of undiagnosed and untreated conditions.At Janakpur Hospital, this cultural barrier plays out every single day.Kamala Devi Mandal, a 30-year-old woman from Khariyani, Janakpur, sat clutching her veil in the waiting area of the Department of Gynaecology, with her mother in law on the side.When her turn came, Mandal hesitated upon seeing a male gynaecologist, Raj Kishor Pandit, at the door. Despite a female attendant’s presence, Mandal’s mother-in-law ultimately did the talking, while Kamala remained silent, visibly uncomfortable.For Issar, these hesitations are all too familiar. She works alongside male gynaecologists in a department where only four of the 13 doctors are female.“In a setting where women are uncomfortable speaking about reproductive issues, especially with male doctors, we have to proceed carefully, often through the person accompanying the patient,” she says.Most of the female patients are accompanied by family members, as husbands are often working abroad.For something as basic as the date of their last menstrual cycle, the patient often defers to the person accompanying her. “Most of them are under a veil,” Issar added, “and removing it, even for an eye check to assess anaemia, takes coaxing… It requires long counselling for women to open up. At times, the information we receive is incomplete, which creates challenges in treatment.”If patients still hesitate to see a male gynaecologist after counselling, a female gynaecologist is assigned when possible, says Issar. However, this is often unfeasible during busy hours due to limited staff compared to the high patient load.Gynecologist Issar says that about 85 percent of the hospital’s gynaecology and obstetrics cases involve pregnancy-related complications, often worsened by malnutrition, lack of prenatal care, and early marriages.General gynaecology accounts for 15 percent of patients, with menstrual issues like dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding common among adolescents under 19, while older patients face infections, cervical cancer, and uterine prolapse.Due to early marriages, multiple childbirths, and home deliveries without medical supervision, many women develop uterine prolapse—a condition typically seen in older women but increasingly common in those as young as 30 in rural Madhesh.The gendered expectations that govern interactions in rural Madhesh leave women ill-equipped to advocate for their health.“During a health camp in Saptari, I found that over ten percent of women under 35 had uterine prolapse,” Issar says. “Early marriage and childbirth in an environment without health education or postnatal care have serious consequences.”The barriers also include outdated beliefs and superstitions which affect women’s diet and recovery after childbirth.“Although the situation has improved, women in remote Madhesh are often prohibited from consuming protein-rich foods like chicken soup or meat after giving birth,” says 24 year old Sapana Ray, a bachelor’s student in public health at Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences. “They are typically allowed only one meal of roti and are discouraged from more water and meal, as it’s believed that this prevents colds and other illnesses in the child,” Ray added, “This lack of nutrition contributes to malnutrition and anaemia, exacerbating their health issues.”When rural women lack basic health literacy, common gynaecological issues go unchecked, leading to preventable complications. For instance, over 80 percent of cases at Janakpur Provincial Hospital are critical.“Most of these severe cases could have been prevented with early intervention or just an understanding of basic health,” Issar says.As Issar sees it, comprehensive awareness campaigns are crucial for educating women about sexual and reproductive health.“The government should consider monthly outreach programmes in rural areas. Women in far rural communities need direct, consistent health education,” Issar says. Further, local health posts with trained personnel could provide preventive care and answer questions women may hesitate to bring up in a hospital setting.The hospital’s efforts to include female attendants in male doctors’ consultations and to counsel women on gender-neutral healthcare only go so far. Often, patients’ deep-seated fears and hesitation prove challenging to overcome.While Madhesh’s women struggle with silence and a lack of resources, healthcare professionals are left piecing together fragmented stories, trying to heal patients who are often reluctant to share their suffering. It is a race against time and tradition.Dr Issar says that it’s unfair to blame women for hesitating to discuss their issues with gynaecologists. “We need to understand and empathise with their background,” she says.Many women, living in conservative settings, rarely have the freedom to speak openly. Given this, she questions, “How can we expect them to feel fully comfortable discussing their sexual and reproductive health, especially with a male doctor?” Even for educated urban women, she adds, these conversations can be challenging.According to Ray, consistent ground-level awareness and counselling programmes on SRH are essential, alongside changes to the conservative and predominantly patriarchal settings in rural areas. “These social barriers, even more than medical intervention, are often the primary obstacles to healthcare access for women in these communities,” she says. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a five-day trout festival offering twelve unique dishes from various cuisines, showcasing the versatility and nutritional benefits of locally sourced trout.\nInspired by cooking shows, a child's passion for baking leads to experimentation, learning the science behind it, and sharing tips for successful home-baking, including oven types, ingredients, leavening agents, and techniques.\nThe Stonewall Riots in New York City sparked the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement, leading to inclusive spaces like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu, which provides a safe haven and promotes acceptance for the queer community.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra, recipient of the James Beard Foundation Scholarship, promotes Nepali cuisine through his restaurant \"The Sewing Tin\" in New York, blending Nepali flavors with modern culinary techniques and aspiring to elevate Nepali food globally.\nCeleus Baral, an environment science student and avid baker, runs Bakeleus, an online baking shop that sells a variety of baked goods, advocating for a zero-waste policy and incorporating her passion for nature and environmental consciousness into her creations.\nKhokana, a serene village near Kathmandu, preserves its ancient lifestyle and architecture despite urban expansion, offering historical sites like Sikali Temple and mustard oil mills, and a glimpse into the Kathmandu Valley's medieval past.\nAmidst the challenges of filming in a changing climate on Turkey's snowy highlands, a producer embarks on a solo trek to Everest Base Camp, discovering resilience and inspiration in the face of obstacles and the fragility of life.\nA six-day tour of Sri Lanka covered a significant portion of the island, highlighting religious sites, natural wonders, tea estates, the Galle Fort, and the Southern Expressway.\nMundhum Trek passes through indigenous villages in Khotang and Bhojpur, Janaki Mandir is a large temple in Janakpur, Kuri Village is a scenic destination with snow in Kalinchowk, Annapurna Base Camp offers a picturesque journey to the foothills of Annapurna South, Bardiya National Park is home to Royal Bengal Tigers, Khaptad National Park is a pristine protected area in Sudurpaschim Province, and Limi Valley provides stunning views of the Himalayas.\nA nostalgic return to Phidim reveals a transformed hometown, marked by advancements and departures, balancing memories with the inevitability of change.\nNepal's loss to the UAE in the U-19 Women's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier puts them at a disadvantage but their hopes of qualifying remain alive with crucial fixtures against the UAE and other teams.\nIndia beat South Africa by 61 runs in the first T20I, thanks to a brilliant 107 from Sanju Samson, with Varun Chakravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi leading the bowling attack with three wickets each.\nQatar has suspended mediation efforts between Hamas and Israel due to lack of progress, and press reports on Hamas' political office in Doha are inaccurate.\nFrom kite-making competitions to love letters soaring high, Kathmandu's kite season, celebrated during Dashain and Nag Panchami, was a vibrant and social event, where kites adorned the skies and brought joy to both fliers and spectators, but urbanization and the advent of modern entertainment options have led to a decline in this cultural tradition.\nMatina Shakya, appointed Kumari in 2008, succeeded by Trishna Shakya in 2017, is now studying management, while the Kumari tradition has evolved to provide Kumaris with education and support, gradually abolishing superstition and stigma.\nJuddha Shumsher's private zoo, begun in 1932, housed a diverse collection of animals, including lions, tigers, rhinos, deer, monkeys, birds, and exotic creatures like crocodiles and porcupines.\nSayyid Abbas Araghchi, a veteran diplomat, was confirmed by the Iranian parliament as foreign minister upon recommendation from newly-elected President Masoud Pezeshkian, who advocates smoothing relations with the West while facing challenges with Azerbaijan, Turkey, the IRGC, and ongoing Israeli offensives.\nDonald Trump overcame them all. A felon convicted 34 times over. A pair of assassination attempts. Endorsement of Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival, by major news organisations and Hollywood A-listers. The baggage of history, whereby in the past 100 years just one other person had won a non-consecutive American presidential election. The opposition’s message that Trump harboured fascist tendencies, that he was openly misogynistic, that he had no concrete plan besides the vacuous ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan—they all fell on deaf ears. On election eve, most Americans said the economy was their top priority and they seem to have voted accordingly—never mind that the US continues to be the best performing rich economy, by a long shot. Whatever the state of the overall economy, many Americans felt their personal lives were getting worse. Harris also clearly failed to kindle hope as first-time voters, especially young men, leaned towards Trump. Arab-Americans were unhappy with US President Joe Biden’s handling of the war in Palestine, and Vice-president Harris seems to have lost many of their votes as a result. It was also interesting that more Americans saw in Trump a better presidential material than they did in Harris.So what does Trump’s triumph mean, especially for the rest of the democratic world? A few lessons emerge. One, it reinforces the message that voters are far from rational creatures and tend to vote with their hearts. Logically, compared to 2020, more Blacks voting for Trump, someone who harbours white supremacist views, does not make sense. Nor does the fact of Arab-Americans voting for Trump, who is likely to be worse when it comes to protecting the rights of the Palestinians. Even more generally, why would you choose someone who neither has the temperament nor the credentials to handle arguably the most important job in the world? But, again, in this age of social media, hard logic alone is insufficient. For example, many first-time male voters said they were persuaded to vote for Trump after watching 30-second Republican messages on TikTok. And most Americans think they are worse off today than they were four years ago, despite many indications to the contrary. Concomitantly, by appealing to people’s baser instincts, a lying Trump could capture many more votes than a rather wooden but more truthful Harris.As in the US, there is a lot of disgruntlement in Nepal, especially among the youth. They feel cheated by old parties and their ageing leaders. Yet newer parties have also failed to gain their trust. Currently, it is unclear what this state of perpetual disgruntlement will lead to. Another Bangladesh, some suspect. People are looking for options to the status quo. Again, as in the US, a strongman may emerge in order to tap into this deep sense of frustration. Like Trump’s tropes, the message of these strongmen will be simple yet emotionally-laden and hence easy to gulp down in a world increasingly drowned in confusing online chatter. We often take our liberties for granted. But as the appeal of ‘democratic strongmen’ like Trump grows far and wide, those freedoms may come under jeopardy. If the US, with its strong history of check and balance, is struggling to manage a single man’s challenge to democracy, a country like Nepal with its weak institutions will be a lot more vulnerable to despotism.   \nSince taking office around three months ago, Health Minister Pradip Paudel has announced several initiatives focused on free healthcare programmes. Although these announcements appear laudable at the outset, those acquainted with our healthcare system suspect they will do more harm than good. Such a spree of free healthcare programmes is impractical in a nation where funding for even basic health facilities is scarce. Isn’t the availability of facilities a prerequisite for making them “free” to the public?Last week, Minister Paudel announced three free programmes, including free treatment for cancer patients under 14. A week before that, Paudel had pledged free care for burn victims who cannot afford treatment. But how will these be executed as hospitals lack vital resources? Every year, around 1,500 children under 14 have cancer. Many have no option but to travel abroad for treatment due to a lack of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, immunohistochemistry, bone marrow transplants and other important tests. Moreover, there is a severe shortage of support staff in health facilities. On burn care, most health facilities only provide basic treatments, compromising patient safety even as, according to the ministry, around 57,000 people are affected by it every year.Without proper budget allocation, such ambitious programmes are bound to fail. In the budget for the current fiscal year, the health sector received Rs86.24 billion, which was only a 2.5 percent increase from the previous fiscal year. With only 4.6 percent of the total budget dedicated to healthcare, experts warned about its long-term impacts, potentially affecting crucial milestones achieved over the years. Several healthcare programmes, including those related to safe motherhood, child health, nutrition, and mental health, were already impeded by the cut in the previous year’s budget. What’s more, the agencies under the ministry don’t even have the funds to provide something as basic as mental health screening training to children and adolescents. While the health minister unveils one free programme after another, the agencies under the ministry seek funds from aid agencies to carry them forward. At a press conference 100 days after assuming office, Paudel claimed that federal hospitals are now better organised and he would now focus on health insurance reform. However, his promise to do away with long waiting lines at state hospitals within a month and raise the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 have yet to be realised. Such long queues reflect the poor healthcare accessibility, with facilities mostly Kathmandu-centric. Over the years, patient numbers have increased exponentially, even while there has been no rise in human resources in state-run hospitals in the past three decades. All of these reflect how misguided and superficial these health-related commitments are. In yet another example of incompetence, the health ministry released a circular in September to operate outpatient services on public holidays. How is this sustainable in a system where doctors are already overworked and offered no extra incentives?Perhaps the health minister should focus more on using available funds to push the current healthcare programmes than on starting more ambitious initiatives. Nepalis have had their fill of populist vows that disregard their well-being, especially in an area as basic as healthcare. Government representatives would do well not to make lofty promises that adds burden on our already overworked healthcare providers.  \nLow-quality goods and price manipulation are rampant in Nepali markets. Are the milk and butter we are buying fresh? What about rice, lentils, noodles and other goods in groceries? And are we being sold fake sneakers and jeans slapped with the labels of popular brands? Also, who among us has not been frustrated when we order one thing online and something completely different arrives? It’s frustrating. But there is hope on the horizon. Starting December, the government plans to establish a consumer court in Kathmandu to hear the consumers’ grievances and complaints against unethical market practices. The court is finally coming into being, nearly three years after a Supreme Court directive. Consumer protection in Nepal has for long been overlooked. The Consumer Protection Act 2018 did mandate the establishment of consumer courts, but there were significant delays in its implementation. This in turn emboldened unscrupulous traders and led to the proliferation of their businesses. Meanwhile, Nepali consumers, long used to getting shoddy deals, have long since stopped complaining. But the new court will allow them to resolve even minor issues quickly and effectively within a specialised setting guided by judges who are experts in consumer law. Consumers only need a bill of goods and services to file a case and they will not have to wait long for a hearing.But there is also bad news. This service is only limited to the federal capital, Kathmandu, which will initially hear cases from Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. Plans are underway for an extension to other districts and provinces, but officials fear lack of adequate budget and bureaucratic hurdles may hinder such an expansion. Some local units have acted against malpractices and punished businesspersons who cheat on customers, but these initiatives are insufficient. What we really need is a nationwide network of consumer courts. Last fiscal year alone, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control filed 178 cases in the District Administration Office, Kathmandu. These cases were related to processed drinking water, food items, lentils, sweet items, oil and ghee, milk and dairy items, and spices. The department recorded many cases of substandard products produced by major brands like Bhat-Bhateni food products, Dabur Nepal, CG Oil and Derivatives and Pokhara Noodles. These businesses were found to be flouting Nepal’s consumer laws and compromising people’s health. Consumer protection provisions were thus due. Now that the country is embarking on the journey of establishing consumer courts, there should be no further delays. Expansion of the courts beyond the confines of Kathmandu Valley should not be a big problem too. We hear of large chunks of budgets of all three levels of government in Nepal going unspent every single year. What better way to spend the money than in ensuring that people get value for their money—at a time unjustified price hikes and selling of fakes is giving them a lot of headache? This is why United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection recognise the “access to and availability dispute resolution and redress mechanism as a basic need of consumers”. That is also among people’s basic rights as taxpayers.  \nFrequent plane crashes, natural disasters, poor infrastructure and bureaucratic challenges—they all ail Nepali tourism. There is a dire need to ramp up efforts to get it on track. But then we as a country are taking a step back when the rest of the world is looking to boost tourism with robust plans and policies. The Civil Aviation Authority’s latest decision to close Tribhuvan International Airport—Nepal’s only ariel gateway for foreign tourists and the sole door of opportunities for millions of its citizens—for 10 hours (10 pm to 8 am) to complete a long-overdue taxiway expansion, has garnered national and international criticism for the strain it will put on the country’s tourism.While there is nothing wrong with the project to renovate taxiways that have worn out from years of use, the authorities perhaps didn’t consider its impact on tourism and passengers seriously. The airport closure from November 8 to March 31 is bound to inconvenience foreign visitors as it coincides with both autumn and spring peak trekking seasons. Festivals, family reunions, holidays and favourable weather make this season the perfect time to travel to Nepal. Such a prolonged halt will only dampen people’s enthusiasm. One is left wondering why such a vital time was chosen for these renovations.The financial repercussions are substantial. The Nepal Tourism Board, which had aimed for 1.3 million tourists this year, has cut down the expected number to 1.1 million. This could lead to a revenue loss of around Rs50 billion for the airline and tourism industry. Indirect cost could be many times higher. International airlines have cut flights or cancelled tickets at short notice, taking airfares to all-time highs. For instance, the most popular destination in November, Sydney, which would have cost Rs85,000 on normal days, will now cost Rs217,000 (for the highest priced tickets) and Rs114,000 (lowest). For average Nepali workers and students, these fares are unaffordable. Tourism entrepreneurs are facing losses as hotels are reporting cancellations.In 2019, for the same project, the airport was closed for seven hours (11:30 pm to 6:30 am) after which 24/7 operations began for the first time to compensate for the lost flight hours. Earlier this year, too, for the very project, landings from the northern side of the airport were barred, but there were no airport closures. Given these precedents, one would have expected more robust planning this time. Instead, it seems there has not been enough homework. The civil aviation authorities’ efforts to manage the Kathmandu airport’s congestion by redirecting traffic to Pokhara and Gautam Buddha international airports have also failed because no foreign airline operator is willing to fly to these destinations. Travel trade entrepreneurs lament that this “unplanned construction” is taking too long and fear it might extend to spring, another peak tourist season. This is understandable given Nepal’s poor record in completing roads and infrastructure. They have also urged the authorities to limit the shutdown to five hours. However, that risks further delaying the project. A balanced approach that prioritises tourism and passengers while ensuring timely completion is the best. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) request that the authorities shorten the closure or spare high-traffic days is logical. Halting operations at peak arrival and departure is neither wise nor sustainable. Ultimately, the health of the country’s civil aviation is closely linked to the state of its regulator. Right now, it appears that our top aviation officials are working more for themselves than for the benefit of the intended beneficiaries.  \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast partly cloudy skies in Nepal’s hilly areas on Sunday, with fair to partly cloudy conditions across the rest of the country.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nIndian restrictions on Nepali goods, including sanitary pads, diapers, shoes, and cement, have halted exports, causing economic distress and unemployment in Nepal despite repeated inquiries and attempts by the Nepali government to resolve the issue.\nPM Oli will visit China to implement past agreements, focusing on the Belt and Road Initiative, and seeking loan waiver for Pokhara Airport, while maintaining balanced relations with India and China.\nDespite agreements, parliamentary committees remain inactive, hindering progress on essential bills, potentially leaving the winter session without adequate business.\nIn a bid to promote exclusive breastfeeding practices, the Ministry of Health and Population has hired 36 staff nurses for deployment to 18 federal and provincial hospitals across the country.Officials hope that deployment of specially trained nurses at federal and provincial hospitals will help promote exclusive breastfeeding practices, which have been steadily declining in recent years.“Two internal experts have been appointed to train child health specialists, who will later train the staff nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division, under the Department of Health Services. “We are also planning to hire breastfeeding counsellors at district hospitals in future.”Studies show that Nepal's exclusive breastfeeding rate has steadily declined over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022, exclusive breastfeeding dropped consistently from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It stated that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), compared to 12 percent of those born at home.Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is prone to contamination and increases the risk of diseases in children, according to the World Health Organisation.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to breastfeed their babies, as studies show. “Hospitals complain that they do not have staff to promote exclusive breastfeeding within their facilities,” said Thapa. “We hope that deploying staff nurses from the centre will help address this staff crunch.”Officials said that the United Nations Children’s Fund has supported the government in hiring staff for exclusive breastfeeding and bringing in international experts to prepare master trainers.The report shows that the proportion of children who are bottle-fed increases with mothers’ education, rising from 12 percent among children of mothers with no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Bottle-feeding is most common in the highest wealth quintile—46 percent—and least common in the lowest wealth quintile—11 percent.Among the seven provinces of Nepal, exclusive breastfeeding rates are the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest at 11 percent in Karnali Province, 12 percent in Madhesh Province and the highest at 43 percent in Bagmati Province.Doctors recommend breastfeeding for the first two years of a baby’s life or longer, as breast milk lowers the risk of illness in children, promotes their recovery during illness, and provides important nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nNepal on Saturday announced a final 18-man squad for the 2024 ACC U-19 Men’s Asia Cup, which is scheduled to take place in the United Arab Emirates from November 29 to December 8.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) announced the squad under the captaincy of Hemant Dhami. Arjun Kumal will be Dhami’s deputy.Dhami will replace Dev Khanal, who led Nepal’s U-19 team at the World Cup in January earlier this year. Khanal recently travelled to Canada and the United States with the senior team to participate in the Canada and US Tri-Series.The U-19 team will also be without Gulsan Jha. Jha failed to carry his form and experience with the senior team to the U-19 World Cup but has now established himself as the key member of the senior team.Aakash Tripathi and Uttam Rangu Thapa Magar are the other cricketers from the U-19 World Cup squad to retain their place in the U-19 team.Shakti Gauchan has been given the responsibility as head coach, while Dhirendra Chand will join the team as assistant coach.Nepal will kick off their Asia Cup campaign against Sri Lanka on November 29.Nepal have been drawn alongside defending champions Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan in Group B.India, Pakistan, hosts UAE and Japan are in Group A.Nepal next play their group match of the 50-over tournament against Bangladesh on December 1 before facing Afghanistan two days later.The group winners and runners-up from each group will progress into the semi-finals, which will take place on December 6. The final will be held on December 8.Holders Bangladesh won their maiden U-19 Asia Cup title in December last year, defeating the UAE by 195 runs in the final.Nepal squadHemant Dhami (captain), Arjun Kumal, Aakash Tripathi, Uttam Rangu Thapa Magar, Mayan Yadav, Naren Saud, Unish Bikram Singh Thakuri, Naren Bhatta, Santosh Yadav, Yubaraj Khatri, Roshan Bishwakarma, Bipin Kumar Mahato, Rajesh Yadav, Dayanand Mandal, Aparajit Paudel, Abhishek Tiwari, Dilshad Ali, Ranjit Kumar.  \nThe Kaski District Court has extended the detention of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) Chair Rabi Lamichhane for an additional 13 days to allow further investigation into alleged cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering charges.On Sunday, the court approved a 13-day remand for Lamichhane and three others detained on similar charges. Judge Navaraj Dahal’s bench granted the extension, as confirmed by court spokesperson Suraj Adhikari.The others in detention include former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, co-director of Gorkha Media Network, along with Leela PachhaI and Ram Bahadur Khanal, all suspected of similar offences.Lamichhane was initially arrested on October 18 from the RSP central office in Kathmandu and brought to Kaski. Following an initial six-day remand, he faced subsequent extensions of seven and ten days before this latest 13-day extension.A parliamentary special probe committee, formed in May to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives, concluded that Lamichhane was involved in misusing millions of rupees funnelled into Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives when he was managing director of the now-defunct media company that operated Galaxy 4K Television. This alleged misuse occurred before he entered politics in June 2022. \nSeven passengers lost their lives while 13 more sustained injuries in a jeep accident at Raduneta of Palata Rural Municipality-3 of Kalikot district.Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, the chief district officer of Kalikot, confirmed that among the 20 passengers on board a Bolero jeep, 10 died at the scene. Other passengers sustained injuries.The jeep, carrying 20 passengers from Thirpu in Palata, met with an accident at approximately 2:30 pm on Sunday, plunging 500 metres off the road.A Nepal Army helicopter from Surkhet was sent to the crash site to assist with rescue operations. Further details on the incident are yet to come. \nFormer minister for internal affairs and law of Koshi Province, Lilaballav Adhikari, who was arrested earlier on Sunday in Biratnagar over allegations of human trafficking, has been transferred to Kathmandu for further investigation. His arrest was allowed by the court today, and he was subsequently escorted to Biratnagar Airport by police.The former provincial minister, Adhikari, landed in controversy for his alleged involvement with a human trafficking ring that recently arranged fake identification documents for three young men attempting to enter Japan. Adhikari and the youths were deported by Japanese immigration authorities last week, and while they were detained upon their return at Tribhuvan International Airport, Adhikari reportedly evaded investigation by using his ministerial identification.The accused ex-minister and three others had travelled to Japan under the pretext of attending the \"Culture at Heart\" programme in Tokyo, organised by Arts Council Tokyo from October 29 to November 3. It is alleged that Adhikari led the group with plans to exploit the event for human trafficking.While Japanese immigration authorities turned the group away due to suspicious documents, criticism arose after Adhikari avoided immediate investigation. Evidence, including fake identification papers used by his associates, has since been seized by authorities, with Adhikari’s signature purportedly forged on some documents.Adhikari has admitted to travelling under the influence of a trafficking network, claiming he was unaware of the criminal nature of the arrangement until he reached Hong Kong. However, officials suspect he only reported the issue to Nepali authorities after Japanese immigration rejected his entry. The ongoing investigation by the Kathmandu District Police has also led to the arrest of other suspects involved in the network.Adhikari had proceeded with the trip despite warnings from Koshi Province’s Chief Minister Hikmat Karki against the unauthorised international travel. \nEighteen Nepalis trafficked through multiple countries to reach Bulgaria were arrested three months ago for entering without valid documents. The Nepali Embassy in Germany, which provides consular support to Nepalis in Bulgaria, confirmed that the Nepalis were detained on charges of illegal entry.The Bulgarian authorities are preparing to deport the detainees this week. They are currently held at a deportation centre in the capital city, Sofia. “There are 18 of us here, waiting for travel documents,” one detainee said. “We hope to be repatriated soon.” The detainee added that none of them have passports. “The Bulgarian authorities have contacted the Nepali Embassy to arrange travel documents for our return.”Sagar Prasad Phuyal, the deputy chief of mission at the Nepali Embassy in Germany, confirmed the embassy’s coordination with Bulgarian authorities to expedite the deportation process. “We have issued the necessary travel documents,” Phuyal said. “The Bulgarian government will cover their travel costs to Nepal, and they are expected to be deported by next week.”The detainees reportedly travelled from India to Romania, then Hungary, and finally Bulgaria, with many initially arriving in Romania on work permits. Of late, there are some reports of instances of some Nepalis abandoning their legal work status in Romania and attempting to reach other European countries.“I was planning to go to Poland,” said one detainee. “I had a three-month Bulgarian visa, but it expired, and I was arrested. Returning to Nepal is now the only option left.” \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel has departed for Azerbaijan to attend the 29th Conference of the Parties (COP-29) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Baku. President Paudel left Tribhuvan International Airport on Sunday.Vice President Ram Sahaya Prasad Yadav, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, and other distinguished officials were present at the airport to bid farewell.President Paudel’s participation follows an invitation from Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. Leading a high-level Nepali delegation, he will represent Nepal at the conference. Nepal’s head of state is scheduled to address the ‘World Leaders Climate Action Summit’ on Tuesday during the high-level sessions on November 12 and 13, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.According to the Ministry, Nepal will conduct a separate high-level session under President Paude’s leadership on November 13 to draw global attention to its climate agenda. \nSome serious newspapers have raised a crucial question recently—why is the Nepali response to the current atrocities of war so scant? This inquisition has an element of sarcasm: Are we not sensitive enough about world events? However, the main concern is about the silence of the Nepalis or the Nepali press on the colossal suffering of men, women and children caused by indiscriminate bombings and shootings that are reported every day. Given that the scale of suffering and physical assaults has surpassed all known limits, this concern is natural. “The scenes may be disturbing” has become the common warning of news anchors, a constant admonition of the apocalypse, as it were. It seems we live in a time when visuals of disaster jostle to take space in our system of understanding the world. Among the horrific events that are common are the wars and killings in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan, to name a few. Besides these, more incidents are happening that assail our sensibilities. The common pattern of suffering and atrocities is uncanny. Lethal bombs fall on peaceful cities and suburbs, hospitals and schools. Never before have such insensitivities showing children crawling out of the rubble, crying in horror and women mourning their dear ones, been reported or recorded as today. I recall one literary event organised by the institution of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) literary writers, held from December 3-6, 2023, in Delhi. The theme of the conference was “Anguish over Senseless Wars.” I want to cite from my article, published in this newspaper under the title of the above-mentioned theme, about the writers’ protest against war: “The anguish felt by the writers about wars, especially the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Gaza wars, truly reflect literary writers’ concern. Non-partisan humanists, creators and advocates of peace and welfare, the writers get hurt more than the others by the colossal loss of lives, including children, in these and other senseless wars. All artists are touched by wars that are truly senseless. There are many instances of writers’ opposition to the wars. But they have paid heavily for such gestures. There is a history of banning books written against wars and other atrocities. In several places today, the voices of writers are drowned; they are even persecuted.” (The Kathmandu Post, December 24, 2023). The general complaint is that Nepali response to world events is not commonly featured in our media, nor does it occupy a space of importance in serious academic discussions. Maybe we must first look at our response to wars and atrocities in history. The Nepali youths, perhaps more than many others in Asia, have encountered and experienced the effects of world events, including wars, with personal involvement, physical loss of lives, and suffering. Researchers have discovered the songs composed by these youths who fought in the First World War as British soldiers. As an example, I would like to mention the research works of Alaka Atreya Chudal, a Vienna University teacher. Several such works record the experience of the Nepali youths who fought in the Second World War. That spectre of history continues to haunt and attract the Nepali youths today. I have no space to mention them here. What it shows is that the Nepali response to world events in history had a subjective and existential character. This subject needs a different treatment. Experiencing the effect of world events differs from looking at the incidents and making objective assessments. But it is natural for us to question today or at any other time about the scanty response to the current horrid events in our political expressions and the media. One Nepali youth, Bipin Joshi, was kidnapped by Hamas in the October 7 attack last year. The complaint is that the killings of civilians in the punitive attacks are not sufficiently reported and that people have not expressed their views on the events. But my impression is that we have responded well to these events. Nepali print and visual media are reporting the events regularly. The other quality of the world events is their diffused and confusing nature. Over the years, the events around the world did not have any recognisable nature. Covid-19 was a crisis that evoked the diverse responses of various world leaders, and the problems became serious after that. World events have had devastating effects on people's minds. In the words of Gordon Brown, Britain's former prime minister, “The world is on fire. At no time since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 has the world looked so dangerous, nor has an end to its 56 conflicts—the highest number since the Second World War—seemed so distant and so difficult to achieve.\" (The Guardian, April 12, 2024). That remoteness and staggering number of events make it difficult for any media or individuals in Nepal to respond to the events. Our response is politically and emotionally oriented, a recognisable pattern in the world today. But the conditions that generate world events go beyond the control of those responsible for them. The rise of certain individuals to power with global effects and the temptation to invade others’ territories and kill innocent people indiscriminately appear to shape the patterns of current events. Nepalis who have their own way of dealing with the world do respond. Their expression is shaped by their political ideologies or sheer humanitarian concerns. And that is happening. There is no space to cite examples here. It is natural for the media to allude to this subject and be surprised at Nepali media’s sparse response to people’s sufferings in all the “senseless wars”. We can question the causes of such a limited response to the terrible suffering of people in the wars. One reason is the emergence of a very boisterous and acrimonious political culture in Nepal, with political groups, media and the public spending most of their time on it. I would not call it solipsism, but this is certainly a subject of concern. Developing a comprehensive vision is the answer.  \nThe American fate has been sealed. Donald Trump has been elected the 47th President of the United States. If his victory in 2016 was more than just a fluke, it is convincing and comprehensive this time. This is what the common Americans want, and the rest of the world will have to live with it, just like the supporters of his Demoractic rival, Kamala Harris, who are still in shock.We can discuss what Trump’s re-election means for the rest of the world and this region, but let us first take a longer detour to understand what is brewing inside the world’s largest democracy.American nightmareIn the first week of March 2024, The New York Times published a report based on their telephone survey of around 980 registered voters, where they interviewed each participant about their perception of the two US presidential candidates. The survey, conducted in collaboration with Siena College in New York, showed that Trump had the support of 44 percent of the prospective voters, compared to 38 percent who favoured then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden. The survey results were significant, considering Trump's exit in 2020 as one of the most disliked presidents in US history, with multiple criminal charges against him. More significantly, only a quarter of the respondents thought the country was on the right track, and around 50 percent believed that the Biden administration’s policies had personally hurt them. A few weeks before the polls, the survey team returned to the seven states, known as the battleground states, to understand the voting behaviour of roughly 7879 likely voters. Close to 90 percent of the participants were certain they would vote, but interestingly, 62 percent were undecided or refused to discuss their voting preference. The question then is, why were television channels and political pundits predicting Harris’s victory when the data and survey polls were far from conclusive? The answer is a bitter pill that analysts and panellists, engaged in an unenviable job of predicting elections, have difficulty swallowing. The world is unfair, and people usually make choices that benefit them personally. From our own electoral experiences, in a developing or developed country, in a highly progressive democracy or a flawed one, we have learned the hard way not to take the voters for granted. Common voters—unlike a party worker, an academic or a self-styled activist, can be individualists who think only about what the candidate has to offer and how their policies affect their lives. They are not always burdened by the higher morals of society, nor are they too concerned about events that don’t directly impact their lives. This is especially true if the voters believe their interests are being put at stake by their representatives in the name of a larger public good. This is at the heart of the majoritarian conservatism that is leading the world into a democratic back-sliding. For millions of people of colour, including Asian Americans, who migrated to the US in the 80s and the 90s, the American dream from Hollywood movies became a reality when the US government adopted a diversity policy to fulfil its skilled manpower needs. There is every reason to believe this policy boosted the US economy and projected the country as the land of democracy and dreams for minorities. But what did it do to the mindset of the majority of white Americans, including the working middle-class population? We do not know, do we? The nationalist rhetoric, often spewing hate against immigrants of different colour and races, did not gain strong support among a large section in a day or a decade. My own experience of writing and talking about the political inclusion of minorities has taught me spending too much time talking in an eco-chamber can blind-sight you from the reality unfolding right before your eyes. The sooner intellectuals and activists in the US understand this, the more they will be invested and interested in understanding the insecurities that have haunted their majority population. After all, the economic and environmental shocks the world has been facing since the last few decades have affected us all, irrespective of race, gender or ethnicity.The global aftershocks If Trump’s re-election has sent shockwaves within the US, its aftershocks will be felt across different continents. His final months of the campaign focused on convincing the Americans that the Biden-Harris administration was bleeding the US economy by fighting proxy wars and that he would get both Putin and Netanyahu to end the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. It will take more than two months for Trump to assume office at the White House and another month for his administration to be in order. Any chances of direct talks with Russia and Israel, if at all, are a few months away. In the Indo-Pacific region, Trump will most likely continue on the course set by the previous administration. Given the global economic crisis that has had far-reaching consequences for both the Chinese and the American economies, Beijing and Washington have agreed to a gradual de-escalation in the Indo-Pacific. Any radical departure from this course will hurt both superpowers and push the global economy into another meltdown. The de-escalation between the nuclear powers will also benefit smaller South Asian states caught in a difficult big-power rivalry. A parallel development in this regard is the US’s relationship with India, which has been strained by the alleged involvement of Indian diplomats in espionage and attempted assassination on US soil. Similar allegations by Canada have resulted in a severe diplomatic fallout with New Delhi. It is unclear how the incoming Trump administration will react to these developments, especially when there is pre-existing discontent over New Delhi’s close ties with the Russians while continuing its security alliance with the US in the Indo-Pacific. If the recent Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) summit in Russia is of any consequence, Washington will need more than just a fleeting interest in the region to fix things with New Delhi. But is Trump ready to ride the high tides in the Indo-Pacific just yet? The president of the US is the world’s most powerful executive, commanding the largest economy and military. So, Trump's re-election as president is one of the most significant political developments of this decade. While Trump’s position concerning the climate crisis and human rights is deeply concerning, the global community will be more interested in his efforts to restore peace in war-ravaged Europe and the Middle East. On the domestic issues, however, we can only say: God bless America! \nFollowing 9/11, the ashes of the World Trade Centre in New York ignited fires in different parts of the world. Even now, 23 years later, those fires are proving difficult to extinguish. The so-called War on Terror (WoT), much like the Cold War, has been an expansive war, which has directly or indirectly affected almost every nation. It would, therefore, be of interest to examine their similarities and differences.The term ‘Cold War’ was first used by George Orwell, the nom de plume of Eric Arthur Blair, in an article in 1945. The war itself commenced with the announcement of the Truman Doctrine in 1947 and concluded with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The WoT started about 10 years later, in 2001. The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in 2021 was celebrated as the end of the WoT. However, post-withdrawal developments proved that the WoT had merely entered a new phase. The US may have physically withdrawn from the theatre, but its strategic interests remained intact. Even today, the great powers and major terrorist groups do not know when the WoT will end.While the Cold War was between two blocs, with other states taking a side, the ongoing WoT was supposed to be between nation-states and violent non-state actors. In reality, some states did provide space, finances, and ideological and diplomatic support to violent non-state actors; otherwise, it would be difficult for the latter to survive.Therefore, though terrorist groups were also active during the Cold War, the post-9/11 era saw a mushroom growth in their numbers. Al Qaeda was established much before the WoT, but it spawned and inspired a number of extremist groups thereafter. The WoT not only impacted the sovereignty of states but also the territorial integrity of a few. Countries like Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and Afghanistan faced instability and were confronted with civil war-like situations.The Cold War was primarily an ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism; the WoT was about combating terrorism based on a struggle against extremist ideologies. The Cold War and WoT both influenced international relations, with alliances shaping geopolitics. The Cold War saw Soviet expansion, with the capitalist bloc trying to contain it. For some analysts, the Cold War was a smokescreen for the US to influence and control events in Western Europe and Japan. On the other hand, the WoT remained largely focused on specific regions, particularly in the Middle East. The Cold War spawned a nuclear race and indirect military engagements, while the WoT saw direct and prolonged military engagements, as seen in Afghanistan and Iraq.To recognise its strategic partners in 1987, the US designated Major Non-Nato Ally (MNNA) status to various countries.MNNAs are not members of Nato but are entitled to certain benefits in military cooperation. Out of the 20 countries with MNNA status, eight received it before 9/11, while 12 countries obtained this status in the post-9/11 era. This highlights how the US grew its military influence around the world following the WoT.The WoT is not restricted to national borders and involves many countries and international coalitions. The WoT often involves state actors combating non-state actors and has therefore influenced security legislation and policies such as the US’s Patriot Act, which extended surveillance and law-enforcement powers within the world’s most powerful nation as well. The WoT also brou­ght with it human rights concerns, es­­pe­cially about tortu­­re, detentions (for example, Guan­tá­namo Bay) and targeted killings via drones.During the initial phase of the WoT, religious ext­remism, ethnic di­­vides, and political marginalisa­­t-ion fur­ther comp-lica­t­­ed the milit­a­ncy la­­ndscape. The WoT gained impetus from globalisat­ion, technological innovations, the openness of media and the stren­gth of social media, which triggered rights and peace movements on the one hand, while enabling the speedy dissemination of hate material and fake news on the other.States with weak economies cannot completely isolate themselves as either parties or victims of violent conflicts. The survival and effectiveness of states require a greater focus on countering violent narratives, which is not possible without investing in social empowerment and improving public service delivery.Terrorism is a transnational phenomenon. There is a need for an increased realisation that terrorism and conflicts benefit only a few powerful entities, while the rest pay the costs. For powerful states and violent non-state actors, terrorism is a commercial enterprise and a source of power, pleasure, and profit. The truth is that sole reliance on military might is not an antidote.—Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nPeople in 71 local units across 20 districts in Nepal were affected by rain-induced disasters in the last week of September. Landslides and floods triggered by incessant rains resulted in massive loss of human lives and infrastructure in Bagmati Province, including the Kathmandu Valley, as well as in the hilly districts of Koshi Province. Over 250 people died as several settlements were swept away. Altogether, around 391 people were killed nationwide in water-induced disasters in the monsoon season that started in the second week of June. The disaster victims were still struggling to come to terms with their losses when people across the country were celebrating Dashain and Tihar.Now, a tougher time awaits disaster victims as the country heads into a chilly winter. The displaced people are staying under flimsy tents and tarpaulins, even as the authorities seem incapable of shifting them to temporary huts that could offer them some succour from the biting cold until their permanent houses are built. In his address to the country on October 23, nearly a month after the worst of monsoon disasters, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli directed the agencies concerned to prioritise the task of assessing damages and making temporary huts for the displaced people. In the same address, he conceded that government bodies hadn’t even assessed damages from the earthquakes that struck Jajarkot, Rukum West, Bajhang, Doti and Bajura a year ago, let alone carry out reconstruction work. The government had announced a total of Rs50,000 in two instalments to build temporary houses for those displaced in the quakes. According to the state-run newspaper The Rising Nepal, the people of Jajarkot district are yet to get the second instalment.Last winter, elderly people, children, pregnant women and those with chronic health problems suffered a lot in Jajarkot as the quake survivors had to live under flimsy tents for months due to the delay in reconstruction and rehabilitation works. When the mountainous districts witnessed rains during the winter, cold-related ailments including pneumonia caused serious problems, especially for small kids and elderly people. Owing to what can only be described as government apathy, hundreds of those displaced by natural disasters years ago can be seen staying under makeshift huts on river banks or in forest areas in various parts of the country.The problem is not always lack of resources. Mismanagement and the government’s failure to properly and timely mobilise available resources is also a reason behind the victims’ sorry plight. For instance, 77 institutional and individual donors have contributed over Rs1.87 billion to the Prime Minister’s Natural Disaster and Rescue Fund as of last week. Even in the past, disaster victims would be shivering under makeshift structures while the government would be sitting on the money donated in their name.As Nepal is vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, floods, glacial lake outbursts and lightning, relevant agencies must be well equipped to help the needy people on time. The situation won’t improve unless there are mandatory provisions with strict timelines to accomplish vital tasks such as assessing damages, shifting the displaced people to temporary huts, distributing money to build permanent houses and for rehabilitation. In the process, the role and responsibility of provinces and local units can be broadened. Also, by coming to the help of the people in times of crisis, the provincial and local governments have an opportunity to prove their relevance as self-governing entities. \nPresident Ramchandra Poudel has appointed two new justices to Nepal’s Supreme Court.Acting upon the recommendation of the Judicial Council and following the approval from the Parliamentary Hearing Committee, President Poudel appointed Nripadhwaj Niraula and Nityananda Pandey as justices of the Supreme Court.The appointments were confirmed on Sunday, as stated by Shailaja Regmi Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Office of the President. The decision was made under Article 129, Clause (2) of the Constitution of Nepal, which grants the President authority to appoint Supreme Court justices based on the Judicial Council's recommendation.Prior to their appointments, Niraula served as Chief Judge at Patan High Court, while Pandey held the same role at the Tulsipur High Court.The Parliamentary Hearing Committee, on November 8, endorsed the names of Niroula and Pandey as Supreme Court justices.The Judicial Council nominated them as Supreme Court justices on September 27. Niroula and Pandey are currently chief judges at the Patan High Court and the Tulsipur High Court, respectively. \nThe COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan’s capital Baku will be among the highest-profile multilateral events attended by Taliban administration officials since they took control in Kabul after 20 years of fighting Nato-backed forces.The UN has not allowed the Taliban to take up Afghanistan’s seat at the General Assembly, and Afghanistan’s government is not formally recognised by UN member states, largely due to the Taliban’s restrictions on women’s education and freedom of movement.Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said officials from the National Environmental Protection Agency had arrived in Azerbaijan to attend the COP conference. The Taliban took over the agency when they returned to power as US-led forces withdrew.Taliban officials have taken part in UN-organised meetings on Afghanistan in Doha, and Taliban ministers have attended forums in China and Central Asia in the past two years.But the UN Framework Convention on Climate Changes Bureau of the COP has deferred consideration of Afghanistan’s participation since 2021, in effect freezing the country out of the talks.Afghan NGOs have also struggled to attend climate negotiations in recent years.Host Azerbaijan invited the Afghan environment agency officials to COP29 as observers, enabling them to “potentially participate in periphery discussions and potentially hold bilateral meetings,” a diplomatic source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Because the Taliban are not formally recognised within the UN system as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, the source said, the officials cannot receive credentials to take part in the proceedings of full member states.Azerbaijan’s presidency declined to comment.The Taliban has closed schools and universities to female students over the age of around 12. It also announced a set of wide-ranging morality laws this year that require women to cover their faces in public and restrict their travel outside the home without a male guardian.The Taliban says it respects women’s rights in accordance with its interpretation of Islamic law.Afghanistan is considered one of the countries worst affected by climate change.Flash floods have killed hundreds this year, and the heavily agriculture-dependent country has suffered through one of the worst droughts in decades. Many subsistence farmers, who make up much of the population, face deepening food insecurity.Some advocates have criticised international isolation of the Taliban, saying it only hurts the Afghan people.“Afghanistan is one of the countries that is really left behind on the needs that it has,” said Habib Mayar, deputy general secretary of the g7+, an intergovernmental organisation of countries affected by conflict.“It is a double price that they are paying,” Mayar said. “There is lack of attention, lack of connection with the international community, and then there are increasing humanitarian needs.” \nThe Supreme Court has declined to issue an interim order regarding the Nepal Premier League (NPL), which the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) is set to organise.A single bench led by Justice Hari Prasad Phuyal heard the petition concerning the NPL and rejected the request for an interim order.Earlier, Aamir Akhtar, on behalf of Zora Sports Management Pvt Ltd, had filed a case with CAN and its central committee as defendants. Akhtar argued that he held the franchise rights to the NPL for 10 years, thereby claiming CAN should not be allowed to organise the league.The NPL, organised by CAN, is scheduled to commence in Kathmandu on November 30, featuring eight franchise teams. \nDozens of people were killed and wounded in an Israeli strike on a house in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip at dawn on Sunday, Palestinian medics said.Footage circulating on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed about a dozen bodies wrapped in blankets and laid on the ground at a hospital. Residents said the building that was hit had housed at least 30 people.The official Palestinian news agency WAFA and Hamas media put the number of people killed at 32. There was no immediate confirmation of the tally by the territory’s health ministry.The Civil Emergency Service says its operations have been halted by an ongoing Israeli raid into two towns and a refugee camp in northern Gaza that began on October 5. It could not provide a figure for those killed in the attack.Israel says it sent forces into Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in the north of the enclave to fight Hamas militants waging attacks from there and to prevent them from regrouping. It says its troops have killed hundreds of militants in those areas since the new offensive began.In Gaza City, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Sabra neighbourhood killed Wael Al-Khour, an official at the Welfare Ministry, and seven other members of his family including his wife and children on Sunday, medics and relatives said.The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports on the strike in Jabalia and in the Sabra neighbourhood.Efforts to conclude a ceasefire between the two warring sides have so far stalled, with Israel and Hamas trading blame. Hamas wants an agreement that ends the war and a prisoner-for-hostages deal, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war will only stop once Hamas is eradicated.Qatar, which has been seeking to negotiate a ceasefire along with Egypt and the US, has told Hamas and Israel it will stall its efforts until both sides show “willingness and seriousness” to resume talks, its foreign ministry said on Saturday.The three nations have been working for months on fruitless talks between the warring sides in Gaza and any disengagement from that process could further complicate efforts to reach a deal.There was no official response from Hamas or Israel.The war erupted when Hamas gunmen attacked Israeli communities on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and seizing another 253 hostages, by Israeli tallies. Israel's military campaign has levelled much of Gaza and killed around 43,500 Palestinians, Palestinian health officials say. \nUkraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 34 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the start of the war in 2022, forcing flights to be diverted from three of the city's major airports and injuring at least one person.Russian air defences destroyed another 36 drones over other regions of Western Russia in three hours on Sunday, the defence ministry said.“An attempt by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack using an airplane-type drones on the territory of the Russian Federation was thwarted,” the ministry said.Russia’s federal air transport agency said the airports of Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovsky diverted at least 36 flights but then resumed operations. One person was reported injured in Moscow region.Moscow and its surrounding region, with a population of at least 21 million people, is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in Europe, alongside Istanbul.For its part, Russia launched a record 145 drones overnight, Ukraine said. Kyiv said its air defences downed 62 of those. Ukraine also said it attacked an arsenal in the Bryansk region of Russia, which reported 14 drones had been downed in the region.Unverified video posted on Russian Telegram channels showed drones buzzing across the skyline.The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war and Donald Trump was elected 47th president of the United States.Trump, who takes office in January, said during campaigning that he could bring peace in Ukraine within 24 hours, but has given few details on how he would seek to do this.When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Trump to congratulate him on his presidential election victory, Tesla CEO and Trump supporter Elon Musk joined the call, according to media reports. Musk owns SpaceX, which provides Starlink satellite communication services that are vital for Ukraine’s defence effort.Moscow ‘Umbrellas’Kyiv, itself the target of repeated mass drone strikes from Russian forces, has tried to strike back against its vastly larger eastern neighbour with repeated drone strikes against oil refineries, airfields and even the Russian strategic early-warning radar stations.While the 1,000 km (620 mile) front has largely resembled grinding World War One trench and artillery warfare for much of the war, one of the biggest innovations of the conflict has been drone warfare.Moscow and Kyiv have both sought to buy and develop new drones, deploy them in innovative ways, and seek new ways to destroy them - from using farmers' shotguns to advanced electronic jamming systems.Moscow has developed a series of electronic “umbrellas” over Moscow, with additional advanced internal layers over strategic buildings, and a complex web of air defences which shoot down the drones before they reach the Kremlin at the heart of the Russian capital.Both sides have turned cheap commercial drones into deadly weapons while ramping up their own production. Soldiers on both sides have reported the visceral fear of drones - and both sides have used macabre video footage of fatal drone strikes in their propaganda.Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding rigours of the war, has called Ukrainian drone attacks that target civilian infrastructure such as nuclear power plants “terrorism” and has vowed a response.Moscow, by far Russia’s richest city, has boomed during the war, buoyed by the biggest defence spending splurge since the Cold War.There was no sign of panic on Moscow’s boulevards. Muscovites walked their dogs while the bells of the onion-domed Russian Orthodox churches rang out across the capital. \nRepublicans on Saturday were close to clinching control of the US House of Representatives, a critical element for President-elect Donald Trump to advance his agenda when he returns to the White House in January.With votes still being counted from the Nov. 5 general election, Republicans had won 213 seats in the 435-member House, according to Edison Research, which projected on Saturday night that Representative Dan Newhouse had enough votes to keep Republican control of Colorado’s 3rd congressional district.Republicans need to win five more seats to keep control of the House and they already have enough victories to wrest control of the US Senate from Democrats, though Edison Research projected late on Friday that Democratic US Senator Jacky Rosen won reelection in Nevada.Edison Research said Democrats have won 205 seats so far, including projecting on Saturday that Representative Greg Stanton in Arizona had won re-election. Democrats would need to win 13 of the remaining 17 seats to take control.With Trump’s victory in the presidential election and Republican winning control of the Senate, keeping hold of the House would give Republicans sweeping powers to potentially ram through a broad agenda of tax and spending cuts, energy deregulation and border security controls.Most of the remaining 17 House races are in competitive districts in Western states where the pace of vote counting is typically slower than in the rest of the country.Nine of the seats are currently held by Republicans and eight by Democrats. Fourteen seats were widely seen as competitive ahead of the election.Republican senators will decide next week who will serve as the party’s leader in the Senate in 2025 with John Thune, John Cornyn and Rick Scott vying for the job. On Saturday, Senators Bill Hagerty and Rand Paul endorsed Scott over the more senior Thune and Cornyn, who have been viewed as favorites.Cornyn vowed late on Saturday that if he wins he will keep the Senate in session until Trump’s cabinet is confirmed.“No weekends, no breaks. Democrats can cooperate in the best interest of the country, or continue the resistance, which will eventually be ground down,” he wrote on X. \nNepal Police on Sunday arrested former minister for internal affairs and law of Koshi Province Lilaballabh Adhikari from Biratnagar. Adhikari, who is accused of human trafficking, was apprehended after receiving permission from the court.According to sources at the Ministry of Home Affairs, Adhikari is being brought to Kathmandu on an aircraft shortly.On Saturday, his party CPN-UML suspended Adhikari from the party responsibilities following allegations of involvement in a human trafficking case.The controversy emerged when Adhikari, along with three other individuals, was sent back from Tokyo after being flagged by Japanese immigration due to suspicious documentation. Adhikari, who reportedly bypassed required travel protocols, subsequently resigned from his ministerial post amidst mounting ethical concerns.Nepal Police’s initial findings show that those who allegedly forged passports and went to Japan with Adhikari had paid over Rs1 million each to attend an event in Tokyo.Adhikari departed for Japan on October 29 without informing the authorities concerned to attend an event organised by the Tokyo Metropolitan.The other three individuals who accompanied him were detained for investigation by the police, but Adhikari had avoided arrest by presenting his ministerial identification.Adhikari, a lawyer by profession, represents Morang Constituency 2(b) and has served multiple terms in the provincial assembly.Organising a press meet immediately after tendering his resignation from the ministerial position, he claimed that he wasn’t involved in any illegal activity. \nTens of thousands of people demonstrated in the eastern Spanish city of Valencia on Saturday over regional authorities’ handling of devastating floods that killed more than 220 people in one of Europe’s worst natural disasters for decades.In the latest demonstration over the floods, protesters filled the centre of Valencia demanding the resignation of regional government leader Carlos Mazon and chanting “Killers!”.“Our hands are stained with mud, yours with blood,” read one banner. Some demonstrators dumped dirty boots outside the government building while others plastered it with mud.Residents in stricken areas accuse Mazon of issuing an alert too late, at 8 p.m. on Oct. 29, well after water was already pouring into many nearby towns and villages.The Valencian leader has said he would have issued an earlier alarm earlier if authorities had been notified of the seriousness of the situation by an official water monitoring body. Mazon did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.“We want to show our indignation and anger over the poor management of this disaster which has affected so many people,” said Anna Oliver, president of Accio Cultural del Pais Valenciano, one of about 30 groups that organised the protest.Though the demonstration was largely peaceful, police charged stone-throwing protesters at one point and objects hurled at the city council building caused minor damage.Following days of storm warnings from the national weather service from Oct. 25 onward, some municipalities and local bodies raised the alarm much earlier than the regional government.For example, Valencia University told its staff on Oct. 28 not to come to work. Several town halls suspended activities, shut down public facilities and told people to stay home.Weather service AEMET raised its threat level for heavy rains in the area to a red alert at 7:36 a.m. on Oct. 29.Nearly 80 people are still missing in what is the most deadly deluge in a single European country since floods in Portugal in 1967 killed around 500. \nWith Donald Trump returning to the White House, there are concerns over how his second term will shape the US foreign policy at large. And what will be its South Asia policy and by extension an outlook towards Nepal?Trumps’ ‘America First’ policy is seen as Washington’s possible drift towards isolationism but his South Asia policy could be guided by his closeness and personal bond with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Strengthening strategic ties between New Delhi and Washington and the evolution of Beijing-Washington ties are other factors to watch out, observers say.Former Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey said Nepal’s relations with the United States will remain unchanged irrespective of who enters the White House—a Republican or a Democrat.Nepal and the United States forged diplomatic relations on April 25, 1947, becoming only the second country to do so after the UK. Nepal established its embassy in Washington DC on February 3, 1958, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On August 6, 1959, the American Embassy in Kathmandu was set up. A number of Nepal’s honorary consuls are stationed in various US cities and a large number of Nepali nationals now live and work in the country.A Republican occupied the White House when Nepal and the US established diplomatic relations, said Pandey. Also, when Nepal opened its embassy in Washington DC and the US did so in Kathmandu, a Republican was at the helm. “When King Mahendra addressed the joint session of US Congress in 1960, a Republican president was in power. Later, when he travelled to the United States in 1967, a Democratic president governed the country. Then, when King Birendra paid a state visit to the US in 1983, there was a Republican president,” said Pandey. “This suggests that the US policy towards Nepal has been stable and smooth.”Though Nepal-US relations have been changing for the better, during Trump’s first presidency between January 20, 2017 and January 20, 2021, bilateral ties took a dip due to the controversy over accepting the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s $500 million grant.The MCC became controversial in Nepal and stirred up debates. After Washington’s repeated clarifications that MCC is not aligned with the US’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and introduction of the 12-point interpretive declaration, the US grant was ratified by the House of Representatives in February 2022. Nepal has also invested $197 million in the MCC projects.During Trump’s first term as president, the American request for Nepal to join the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and State Partnership Program also caused unease in Nepal. Successive governments have clarified that Nepal does not intend to join these two US initiatives.Nepal’s former permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva Sambhu Ram Simkhada hopes that relations between Nepal and the US will remain good in Trump’s second term.“But it is more important to see how relations between powerful countries evolve during Trump’s second term,” he said.In Trump’s first term, some of his decisions like withdrawing from the Paris climate pact, the World Health Organisation, ending US support for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and blocking abortion rights had an impact on Nepal as well. Nepal is looking for compensation for the damages from adverse effects of climate change, which is triggered mainly by the greenhouse gases emitted by large industrial countries.Nepal must tread carefully, said Pandey, especially with the US citizens electing a decisive president who wants no delays in action. Like Simkhada, former minister Pandey also believes that evolving ties between the US, India and China will shape Washington’s policy towards Kathmandu.Nepal is on the strategic radars of India, China and the US, said Pandey. “Therefore, it should be careful while navigating its relations with these three powers. Nepal should maintain healthy relations with both India and China.”Nepal should not be tempted to use its ties with one neighbour against the other, Pandey added.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has yet to issue a congratulatory message on Trump’s election but President Ramchandra Paudel and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli have congratulated the president-elect.In his congratulatory message on Wednesday, Paudel expressed confidence that the Nepal-US relationship would be further strengthened during Trump’s second term.Prime Minister Oli on Thursday stated that Trump’s return to the Oval Office is a historic chapter in American history. Oli also said that he looks forward to deepening Nepal-US relations, fostering mutual prosperity and cooperation under Trump’s leadership.“It would be interesting to see how the US relations with India and China evolve,” said Simkhada. “That will have a big bearing on Nepal-US relations, perhaps as much as Nepal’s own relations with these three powers.” Former Nepali ambassador to the United States Arjun Karki said that the US policy towards Nepal will remain unchanged despite changes in the US government as Kathmandu has already worked with the Trump administration. Karki served as Nepal’s ambassador to the United States during Trump’s first term. “But yes, some global policies he pursues might impact Nepal.”“In his first term, Trump cut or downsized the US funds in areas like climate change, access to the abortion rights, health, and financial assistance to the World Health Organization. If he continues on the same path, Nepal will be affected,” said Karki, who served as Nepal’s US envoy from 2015 to 2021.Karki believes the US policy towards Russia and Israel will change but not so much its outlook towards China. “Perhaps some of Trump’s interventionist policies might even be to Nepal’s benefit,” he adds.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \nIt’s now all but certain: Oli will visit China in early December. This trip would mark a break from the tradition of Nepali prime ministers making their first “official” visit to India. There is nothing to quibble about, as flying to New Delhi first is merely an unwritten custom, not a formal requirement. So, Oli’s planned visit to Beijing isn’t a breach of any protocol; rather, it could set a precedent.Yet questions have lingered over why Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hasn’t extended an invitation to Oli, sparking speculation that Oli began planning a trip to China after waiting in vain for an invite from New Delhi. In some circles, there is a belief that Oli’s ascension to power is not to India’s liking. Some within Oli’s orbit have remarked that certain foreign powers have been trying to unseat the government without providing evidence to support this claim.Oli and India amid global shiftsEven Oli can’t deny that his past actions and rhetoric have frequently irked New Delhi. While his assertive stance may have earned him a “nationalist” image among sections of Nepali society, it has also placed him in India’s bad books. Attempts at rapprochement have been met with a cold shoulder, leaving him to orchestrate his return to power. Since the 2022 elections, he’s worn many hats: Coalition partner, opposition leader, and now, once again, prime minister.Yet India appears unconvinced. While Modi’s government rolled out the red carpet for Arzu Rana Deuba of the Nepali Congress, who serves as foreign minister in Oli’s Cabinet, it has yet to extend an invitation to Oli, despite him being in office for over 100 days and even meeting Modi in New York in September. Meanwhile, Oli’s government has repeatedly signalled its keenness to host Modi in Nepal, failing to elicit any concrete response.Then, has India abandoned its long-standing tradition of hosting the Nepali prime minister soon after a new government is formed? If so, this raises broader questions about India’s much-touted “Neighborhood First” policy. Extending an invitation to Oli could have shown goodwill and reinforced New Delhi’s proclamation that “Nepal is a special priority partner.”Amid rapid geopolitical shifts, India may have set its sights on bigger platforms and larger roles in the world order, but it would do well not to ignore its neighbours or treat them based on the government of the day. On Nepal’s part, its foreign policy is becoming increasingly complex, extending beyond bilateral ties with India and China, as Sino-Indian and Sino-American tensions and interests intersect more with a growing US influence in Asia amid shifting global dynamics. Oli, as the incumbent, needs to tread carefully. His role demands deft management of relations with India and China while also recalibrating Nepal’s strategic posture in a complex and evolving geopolitical landscape.The northern nexusNepal’s communist leaders often lean towards, or appear to align with, China when they want to “send a message” to India. Oli is no exception. Even before an official invitation was extended, extensive media reports outlined Oli’s potential agenda for the trip, including efforts to secure a loan waiver for the Pokhara International Airport and agreements on some Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. The Chinese, who often practise quiet diplomacy, have yet to comment on Oli's planned visit. Meanwhile, the BRI remains a contentious issue in Nepal, with Beijing eager to reframe all China-funded projects under its banner. Oli currently leads a strong government with support from the Nepali Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Congress’s position on the BRI and other forms of assistance is clear—grants are acceptable but loans are not. If Oli avoids pushing too aggressively with China, potentially unsettling his coalition partner, his position remains secure. Deeper engagement with China could bring valuable infrastructure projects, but it also raises concerns about long-term dependency and potential political leverage. It’s up to Nepali leaders—especially Oli—to negotiate beneficial terms.The Nepali public is divided on Chinese aid: Some see it as a counterbalance to dependence on India, while others fear it might lead to undue influence from the north. Both views have merit and flaws, making it crucial for the current leadership to steer Nepal’s foreign policy in a direction that serves and safeguards the country’s interests.While Nepal could benefit from its northern neighbour’s economic and technological might, it is not in a position to ignore its southern neighbour, with whom it not only shares historical, cultural and people-to-people ties but also carries out a majority of its trade.The catchDiplomacy often works best when conducted quietly. Oli’s “preparations” to visit Beijing could have been kept under wraps until concrete plans were in place. The premature leak of his intentions by his circle allows room for speculation that this may have been a tactic to pressure India.While China seeks to expand its influence in Nepal, it remains cautious about provoking India to the point of confrontation. And India, too, appears hesitant to employ its usual political manoeuvres in Nepal, particularly after recent setbacks in its immediate neighbourhood. As the Sino-Indian relations show signs of thawing, Nepal stands to benefit from reduced regional tension. Oli would be wise to avoid antagonising either neighbour.Nonetheless, Oli has an uncanny inclination to critique India. While he uses backchannels to re-engage with New Delhi, his public jabs at India reveal his characteristic defiance. If his plan to visit China is driven more by spite than by a balanced foreign policy strategy, he risks making a strategic misstep.Even after over 100 days in office, Oli’s performance has been dismal on various domestic fronts. Neither Oli nor his coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, has been able to justify the formation of this “stable” government.With his political legacy on the line, Oli has an opportunity to “achieve something meaningful” as prime minister, and he should approach foreign policy with a view toward lasting impact.Foreign policy is certainly a tough balancing act for a country like Nepal, sandwiched between the world’s two large economies. In an era of fluid geopolitics, future Nepali leaders will likely face further challenges in balancing relations with both neighbours. Nepali politicians’ failure to pursue a cohesive and balanced foreign policy has already tarnished Nepal’s international image.In the intricate world of foreign policy, there’s little room for grandstanding. And, adventurism can backfire. Oli has a unique chance to set a precedent for independent, balanced diplomacy that could serve as a model for the country and his successors.His China sojourn could go beyond simply breaking the so-called custom of prioritising one neighbour over the other; it might even pave the way for a new approach. But this must be done in the best interest of Nepal, not to satisfy personal pride or vanity. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is known for his supposed ability to implement decisions and accomplish the tasks he takes up even at the cost of becoming unpopular.But a series of events after he became prime minister in mid-July tells a different story.In the three and half months since he assumed office at Singha Durbar, the prime minister has been compelled to backtrack on a couple of his plans or postpone them.In the first week of September, Prime Minister Oli pushed a plan to remove Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar from the post and elect a lawmaker from the ruling Nepali Congress in her place. According to multiple leaders privy to the development, by electing a Congress lawmaker as deputy speaker, Oli wanted to strengthen relations with the major coalition partner Congress, which has more seats than the prime minister’s party, the CPN-UML, in the House of Representatives. Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba has a special interest in getting a lawmaker from his party elected to the post, as deputy speaker is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which nominates members and heads of constitutional bodies.The prime minister on September 9 convened a meeting of the ruling parties and floated a proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar and sought a green signal from the coalition partners to his plan.After the meeting, party leaders told the Post that Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office. Deputy Speaker Magar courted controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role. On February 26 last year, Magar wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting a visa interview for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she was under pressure to step down.Last month, the prime minister held several meetings and consultations with a plan to introduce an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act-2017 with an intention to facilitate party splits. This plan also drew widespread criticism as leaders from various political parties and independent observers accused the prime minister of plotting splits of fringe political parties with a plan to merge their dissident groups into the UML.His proposal to introduce ordinance was reportedly floated in order to merge the Ashok-Rai led Janata Socialist Party and the dissident group from the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), which in turn would make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives.As the major coalition partner, the Congress, reportedly did not back his proposal to introduce the ordinance, Oli was again pushed to the back seat.These are just a few cases in point. Oli from the start of this tenure has struggled to assert his authority.Professor of political science Krishna Pokharel assesses that there may have been an understanding between Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli to arrest Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane, who was accused of misappropriating cooperative funds, and issuing an ordinance related to political parties.Pokharel believes that the two leaders might have reached a deal to accomplish the two goals—bring an ordinance to facilitate the split of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which was formed in 2021 after breaking away from the UML; and arrest Lamichhane. Lamichhane, the immediate past home minister, had reportedly tried to arrest Congress chief Deuba’s spouse (current foreign minister) Arzu Rana Deuba, on charges of involvement in the Bhutanese refugee scam. “While the wish of the Congress chief was fulfilled, the interest of the UML chair and the prime minister was not,” Pokharel said. However, the UML leaders don’t buy this argument. Vice-chair Yubaraj Gyawali said that the government under UML leadership has just completed its 100 days, so it is too early to judge its performance. “There are many good initiatives taken by this government whose results will come in due course,” Gyawali told the Post. “Everything that the head of the government wants cannot be achieved in such a short period, but that does not mean his influence has waned.” But some political analysts say that Oli’s standing has declined since he became prime minister this time with the support of Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Oli dismisses those who claim his influence has gone down. While addressing the symposium on ‘Role of former security personnel in National Security and Development’ organised by the Nepal National Former Army and Police Association on October 27, Oli rubbished claims that his influence was steadily decreasing.“Those who claim my charm has decreased will know the reality in the 2027 election,” Oli said.Sarita Bhusal, a UML lawmaker, said a mistaken impression might have been created among the people. “Sometimes there are constraints to leading a coalition government,” Bhusal told the Post.Gyawali, a vice chair of the UML, agrees. “Earlier, Oli became prime minister with the support of smaller parties. But this time, he has the backing of the largest party in Parliament, so it is not easy for him to do all that he wants.” Oli first headed a coalition government after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. When he became prime minister again in 2018 after the 2017 election, his party was the largest in the House. He became prime minister with the support of the Maoist Centre, which was his coalition partner during his previous stint as well.The Congress publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, said his party has been giving full support to the Oli government. “Our party has not opposed any government programme that is good for the country,” Bishwakarma told the Post. “We only caution the government on issues that may cause public backlash.”This government was formed in the spirit of a seven-point agreement between the two parties, and achieving those objectives must be its primary focus, Bishawakarma said. Of late, Oli has also faced criticism from within his party. Some UML leaders publicly opposed his recent decision to accept a donation from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of Bhatbhateni Supermarket, for the construction of the party’s head office. Experts see it as a sign of his decreasing hold in the party organisation. Although party’s standing committee member Binda Pandey and central committee member Ushakiran Timilsina protested against it publicly, other party leaders are also reportedly dissatisfied with Oli’s decision.Bhim Rawal, who contested the election for chair against Oli during the party’s 10th general convention in Chitwan in November 2021, also criticised Oli for accepting the donation. Sidelined by Oli, Rawal is currently inactive in the party. Even leaders like Gokul Baskota, who used to be a staunch Oli supporter, couldn’t back him on the deal with businessman Gurung.In an interview with Image television, Baskota said, “The UML cannot accept Gurung’s donation and carry his old baggage.” On October 28, the Supreme Court issued an interlocutory interim order barring the ruling party, UML, from building any structure on the land donated by businessman Gurung. A single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel said the UML-Gurung donation deal was illegal prima facie, putting Oli further on the defensive. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nAuthor Thomas Bell unveiled his second book, ‘Human Nature’, at a launch event hosted by KathaSatha at the Patan Museum on Saturday. The programme commenced with a conversation between Bell and Aditya Adhikari, a former journalist and columnist for the Kathmandu Post. In his conversation with Bell, Adhikari said, “The book explores the hills and mountains surrounding Kathmandu, offering much more than a travelogue. Bell has written about cultural history and the environment based on his research.” Having spent decades in Nepal, Bell’s new book blends travelogue with folklore, literature, art, and anthropology. It addresses topics like the impact of British Imperialists and external pressures on the environment.“The book is divided into four sections, featuring my four different walks through the Himalayas, each during a different season,” said Bell. In the first section, Bell delves into the theme of migration, covering various issues such as the moving of the Gurkhali soldiers, labour migrations to the Middle East, and the migration of birds, animals, and fish. He also touches on the arrival of the first settlers in the hills, Rai mythologies, and the shamanic histories of the landscapes. Similarly, the second section of the book details his journey to Dolpo. Adhikari remarked that he enjoyed reading Bell’s description of landscapes. The writer, however, mentioned, “I did not want to get too much into the whimsical description of nature, which was kind of challenging for me.”The final section documents Bell’s journey to Rara Lake, where he discusses the concept of wilderness. In his conversation with Adhikari, he said, “The idea of taming the wilderness is seen to be projected into the Himalayan region, due to which people were expelled from their homes.” He gave the example of Rara Lake, where residents were displaced to transform the area into the national park it is today. “On writing this book, I cast my net as far as it could reach because the subject of social issues is so expansive.” Bell mentioned that he relied on historian Mahesh Chandra Regmi's research and cited author Shanker Koirala as a reference from his work ‘Khaireni Ghat’. Bell also read a brief excerpt from his book and answered questions from the audience. In answering the audience queries, Adhikari emphasised that ‘Human Nature’ is mainly written for a Nepali audience, aiming to resonate more with local than international readers.Guests, including actress Manisha Koirala and writers Amish Raj Mulmi, Rishi Amatya, and Dia Yonzon, attended the event.  \nEveryone is after contentment in life. Whether studying, working, or earning, our actions aim to achieve happiness. The desire for eternal happiness and peace is deeply rooted in human nature. ‘Ananda Samhita’ by Ghanashyam Khadka explores this universal pursuit: what happiness and sadness mean. It examines how people chase after happiness and suggests alternative approaches that might lead to fulfilment and inner peace.This book guides us to find peace and happiness within ourselves, independent of external or superficial influences. The author explains that people often chase happiness in ways that lead to disappointment. If happiness is dependent on fleeting moments, it isn’t true happiness. Instead, joy should be enduring and accessible of reason—if one can be happy without cause, nothing can take that joy away. Happiness and peace are ongoing states that come from within.The author suggests that sadness often arises from a lack of self-awareness. Happiness and sadness, he argues, aren’t the outcomes of events but rather our attitudes toward them. A positive approach to life can transform difficulties into opportunities, turning darkness into light and challenges into growth. Staying peaceful is an art; it doesn’t come by birth and can be achieved by preparation. The author explains everything in detail, helping readers grasp the content quickly. He uses relatable examples to bring depth to the ideas, encouraging readers to apply them to everyday life. This book contains questions and reflective activities that make us contemplate our lives. Khadka writes, “In the universe, we are very tiny; thus, stressing over minimal things and being sad is not worthy.” The book unfolds over 18 interconnected chapters, each guiding the reader to self-discovery and inner peace. Every chapter introduces a new concept and topic, which is also the chapter’s theme, building on the last and adding new layers. The author explains how the presence and absence of particular qualities or perspectives can shape our pursuit of peace, making each chapter a stepping stone toward achieving a more profound sense of contentment.The author has included different stories to bring the concepts to life, keeping readers engaged. These stories serve as relatable examples, making the ideas more memorable. For instance, he shares the story of a famous scientist, Albert Einstein, and his driver to illustrate how we naturally adopt traits from those we spend time with. This leads to his advice: surround yourself with people who inspire you, are intellectually curious, and are self-aware.While reading the book, I applied many suggested mindfulness practices and self-help tips. While philosophical books like this may not appeal to everyone, ‘Ananda Samhita’ engages readers with reflective activities at the end of each chapter, making them more interactive and applicable to daily life.Each activity encourages us to reflect on the chapter’s insights and integrate them into our daily lives. As I read through the activity guidelines and tried a few, it felt like meditating while listening to Prawachan. Yet, I struggled to concentrate and thoroughly follow the instructions. This experience made me realise that a calm, focused mindset is essential to truly absorb this book's wisdom and put its teachings into practice. Although reaching this level of immersion might seem unrealistic in our hectic lives, it’s precisely for this reason that the book was written.All the activities focus on positive self-talk and affirmations, which soothe the mind and heart, bring calmness, and build self-confidence. As the saying goes, “You become what you feed your mind.” We can move toward a positive life by practising positive affirmations and cultivating an optimistic inner dialogue.The writer advises that we should master our hearts rather than be ruled by them. He explains that true happiness and salvation remain out of reach if our hearts control us. By embracing our inevitable death, we can learn to value each moment, allowing us to live more fully in the present. This acceptance, he argues, leads to a deep awakening to life’s true worth.The author draws on the story of Siddhartha Gautam, who left his palace comforts upon realising death's inevitability. Gautam’s choice to renounce superficial pursuits underscores the importance of focusing on meaningful goals rather than allowing trivial distractions to sidetrack us. Life is uncertain, and by keeping this in mind, we can better appreciate its value and avoid wasting time on distractions that pull us away from our ultimate purpose, salvation.Moreover, the author backs the text with data, statistics, and insights from psychological theories by figures like Sigmund Freud, Carl Rogers, and Abraham Maslow, as well as scientific principles. He also incorporates Nepali proverbs and cultural sayings to ground complex ideas in relatable language. Khadka also talks about the teachings of Buddha and uses them as a reference. This blend of psychology, science, and spirituality creates a well-rounded and accessible framework for readers, making profound ideas easier to grasp.That said, this book may not resonate with everyone. As someone who doesn’t usually gravitate toward philosophical texts, I found ‘Ananda Samhita’ both challenging and thought-provoking. The author delves into philosophical, spiritual, and idealistic ideas that sometimes seem abstract or impractical yet carry profound meanings. While I respect the message about striving for peace and ending suffering permanently, I find it challenging to agree. In today’s fast-paced, highly competitive world, such ideals can feel out of reach and perhaps impractical for many.Additionally, the book introduces complex terms and concepts that, despite explanations, may still feel elusive to some readers. ‘Ananda Samhita’ is a thoughtfully researched book offering valuable insights into understanding our inner selves—something many overlook. The author’s engaging writing style captivates readers. The book also challenges our attachment to worldly possessions and questions how we perceive life, happiness, and sadness. Fresh perspectives in the text invite readers to reflect on their lives and guide them toward peace and happiness.Ananda SamhitaAuthor: Ghanashyam KhadkaYear: 2024Publisher: Alchemy PublicationPages: 231 \nThe next general elections are three years away, but political parties have already started devising strategies to secure victory.While all major parties are discussing ‘mission 84’ (election year 2084 BS, or 2027 AD), the CPN-UML is ahead of others in formulating strategies as much as it plans to collect private information on individual voters. In a bid to assess its strength, the ruling party has decided to find out the political affiliation of each voter.The country's second-largest party will send its volunteers to each household to find out the political leanings of the members. “Our local cadres know who our sympathisers are and who is associated with other parties. The study aims to find out the political inclination of those whose affiliations are not known,” Bishal Bhattarai, a UML politburo member and member of the party’s Organisation Department, told the Post. Such study has already started in local units where byelections are being held next month. The voting is taking place for 44 positions including mayors and chiefs of rural municipalities in 33 local units across the seven provinces on December 1. The seats had turned vacant due to deaths and resignations, and other reasons. The party plans to conduct the nationwide study for two months, from mid-February to mid-April next year. As per the schedule, the party’s central office will receive the reports from the local level by the end of the current fiscal year—mid-July.Party leaders claim the survey is for the party’s internal purposes to evaluate its strengths. “Based on the report, the party will devise its strategy to strengthen its positions wherever it is weak. Such surveys are done in other countries as well,” Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the party, told the Post.However, political experts don’t think the matter is as simple as the UML is trying to project. Krishna Khanal, professor of political science, said in principle there is nothing wrong with conducting surveys to collect information to devise strategies to mobilise party. “However, in a country like ours where the government’s treatment of people often depends upon their party affiliation, the ruling party studying the common people’s political affiliation is a serious matter. It will not only intimidate ordinary people, but also raises concerns that state machinery could be misused to bring neutral voters into the UML’s camp,” he told the Post.Some political analysts see this move as an intrusion into personal matters. Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, collecting information of individual party affiliation is not an acceptable act in democracy. “The UML is trying to adopt a radical communist strategy. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) applied a similar strategy to remain in power for long,” he told the Post.Not just the radical communists but right wing forces in India too are embracing a similar strategy to turn election results in their favour. During every election, from the municipal to Lok Sabha, India’s Bharatiya Janata Party appoints panna pramukhs (unit incharges), who are tasked with influencing voters at the household level.Every constituency is divided into blocks, with lists of voters from every 10 to 12 families. And a person called panna pramukh is assigned to pay special attention to the families of his/her designated area. Their job is to convince them to vote for the party. This strategy seems to have worked for the right-wing party, which won the elections for the third consecutive time in June. “It is not surprising to see that extremists, no matter whether they are right wing or left wing, adopt similar strategies,” said Pyakurel. The UML, which has seen a decline in the number of its organised cadres, wants to increase their numbers to at least one million which hovers around half that figure at present. It believes it can devise policy to increase its vote base based on the survey results. In the 2022 general elections, the country had 17.79 million registered voters.Pyakurel, however, doesn’t believe that the UML’s initiative is going to benefit it hugely during the elections. If his claims are anything to go by, swing voters have a significant share in Nepal and no single strategy by the UML is likely to guarantee results in the next general elections. Nepal is the country where pre-poll surveys are illegal although they are practiced elsewhere in the world. However, there is no restriction on a ruling party gathering information on people’s political affiliations. “The Election Commission must come forward to stop the UML’s move,” said Khanal, the professor.The UML leaders, however, say there is no need to ‘make a mountain out of a molehill’. “This is just the party’s internal survey. We are sensitive enough to individual freedom and the right to privacy,” said Bhattarai. \nPolitical parties have expedited their preparations for the by-elections slated for next month in various local units.The by-elections will be held on December 1 for various positions that went vacant due to various reasons after the local elections in 2022.As the Election Commission has fixed November 18 for filing the candidacy, parties are busy selecting their candidates for the 44 vacant seats ranging from the chief of the district coordination committees to the ward chairpersons.The voters from different local units will vote to elect two chiefs of the district coordination committees, chairpersons of two rural municipalities, four vice-chairs, one mayor, one deputy mayor and chairs of 34 wards. Votes will also be cast to elect chiefs of the district coordination committees in Okhaldhunga and Kailali, the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in Kathmandu, and the deputy mayor of Nalagad Municipality in Jajarkot.Similarly, the elections will be held to elect chairpersons of Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang and Mahabu Rural Municipality in Dailekh, and the vice-chairs of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality in Dolakha, Sarkegad Rural Municipality in Humla and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura.Additionally, elections will take place to elect ward chair positions in various local units including in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City and Kirtipur Municipality.The Local Level Election Act, 2016 envisions by-elections to fill vacant positions such as district coordination committee heads, vice-heads, rural municipality chairs, vice-chairs, mayors, deputy mayors, and ward chairs if their term has not expired and has more than a year left with for their term. The representatives in all the vacant positions were elected on May 13, 2022 with just half of their terms completed so far.Suman Ghimire, information officer at the commission, said the nominations can be filed during the office hours on November 17 and the list of candidates will be published by 6 pm the same day.Anyone who has an objection to the candidacy of any contestant can lodge the complaint the next day. Similarly, candidates will be allowed to withdraw their candidacies, if they wish so, by 1 pm on October 20.The final list of the candidates from all the vacant positions will be published the same day while the election symbols too will be allotted between 3 pm to 5 pm on the day.“Twenty-five parties have been registered in the commission to compete in the by-polls,” said Ghimire.According to the constitutional poll management body, the mayoral and deputy mayoral candidates can spend a maximum of Rs450,000, rural municipality chairs and vice-chairs are allowed to spend up to Rs350,000 while the aspirants for the district coordination committee chief and deputy can spend up to Rs50,000.Rs300,000 is the maximum amount the candidates for metropolitan city ward chairs can spend but the ceiling is Rs200,000 and Rs150,000 for the ward chairpersons of the municipality and rural municipality, respectively.The main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre) is ahead of other major parties in candidate selection. It has decided to field Shivsharan Maharjan, a professor by profession, for the vacant mayor's position in Kirtipur Municipality. It has picked Nimleki Sherpa for the vice-chairperson position in Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha. The third largest party has also finalised its candidates for the ward chairpersons in most of the local units where the by-polls are going to take place.The ruling CPN-UML has picked the contenders for by-elections in the local units from Kathmandu but is yet to decide for other parts. Surendra Manandhar, a UML central committee member, is the party’s mayoral candidate in Kirtipur. Laxmi Ratna Tuladhar will contest for chairperson of ward 16 of the Kathmandu Metropolis from the UML.Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the second largest party, said all the party’s candidates will be finalised within a couple of days.The Nepali Congress, on the other hand, has already received lists of the probable candidates from the respective local units but is yet to finalise the names. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which came into existence after the 2022’s local elections, is also preparing to contest the by-polls this time.All the parties, including those who had contested earlier polls forming pre-poll alliances, have announced they’d contest the upcoming elections independently. \nTwo ruling parties have formed a three-tier political mechanism—at the centre, in the provinces and in the districts—in order to facilitate the government of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML at the centre and to resolve any disputes at the provincial and district levels.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba will head the mechanism, according to a statement issued by the secretariat of the newly announced body on Wednesday. The first meeting of the mechanism was held on Tuesday. At the central level, they formed an eight-member team with four members from each party. Among them are the parties’ office bearers and ministers in the Oli Cabinet. However, in the provinces and districts, each party will have three representatives in the task force.The decision to form the joint mechanism is aimed at minimising the differences between the two parties, supporting the spirit of government formation agreed in mid-July when the parties came together, according to ruling party leaders.The development comes at a time when the popularity of the Oli government is dipping as it fails to revive the ailing economy, unlike what was promised in mid-July. The mechanism is also tasked with removing the obstacles to the two parties’ coalition so that it continues to govern until the elections in 2027. Formation of the mechanisms at provincial and district levels are said to be in the final stage.Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak are Congress members in the task force while UML senior vice-chairman Ishwar Pokhrel, General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel and deputy general secretary Bishnu Rimal are representing Oli.The decision was made on October 31, Rimal told the Post. The objectives of the mechanism are to support and facilitate the works of the three-tier government.Representatives from the two parties will lead the mechanism by turns. Khadka of the Congress will coordinate the meetings for a month from November 5. At the provincial level, Congress provincial party chief, incumbent chief minister or the parliamentary party leader (in case the party is not leading the provincial government) and the senior member of the provincial Cabinet will be members of the task force.From the UML, provincial party chair, provincial in-charge and parliamentary party leader will be members of the task force, said Rimal. At the district level, Congress party president and two office bearers will be the members.The UML district in-charge, party chair and secretary will be represented in the task force, according to Rimal.The political mechanism also announced the visit of Prime Minister Oli to China scheduled for December 2-6. But the government is yet to make a formal announcement of the visit. At the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, prime minister Oli is paying an official visit to China in December. As per the instructions of Prime Minister Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana will coordinate the visit. The task force will lay the groundwork for the visit , the statement added. Rana has already cancelled her scheduled trip to Baku, Azerbaijan where she was to attend the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference. President Ramchandra Paudel is leading the Nepali delegation in the UN climate change conference. The main objective of the three-tire mechanism is to assist and support the federal, provincial and local governments, said Rimal. The provincial and district level mechanisms will resolve disputes related to government functioning, he added. “The main purpose of the mechanisms is to convince people that the government will deliver and address their needs. The mechanism will help restore trust and hope and will solidify the Congress-UML alliance,” added Rimal.Leaders said that there is good working relations between the two parties at all three levels.“This government will complete its full term. The current political Oli-Deuba partnership is doing well as there is a high level of mutual trust,” said Rimal. He said the government would stay intact so long as the trust between Oli and Deuba remains intact and so long as the UML remains a united party. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nTen people were injured in a bus accident at Ghumaune in Kharipati of Bhaktapur district on Tuesday. Two are reportedly in critical condition.According to Pradeep Khatri, a traffic police inspector and chief of the District Traffic Police Range, the bus coming from Talakot of Changunarayan Municipality lost its control and hit a pole. The injured are undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital, police said. \nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nThe heavy rainfall in late September, which triggered floods and landslides in most parts of the country, caused a loss of Rs46.68 billion to Nepal’s economy, nearly three-fold more than the initial estimates.According to the preliminary loss and damage assessment report released by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority under the home ministry on Thursday, the floods and landslides from September 26 to 28 caused significant damage to the physical infrastructure sector, followed by the social and productive sectors.According to the report, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology reported that out of 222 rainfall measurement stations across Nepal, 77 recorded heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving over 200 millimetres in just 24 hours. Kathmandu experienced its highest rainfall on record, surpassing previous measurements set in 2002. The Tribhuvan International Airport station recorded 239.7 millimetres of rain, highlighting the intensity of the weather system affecting the region.More than 83 percent of the total economic losses were observed in the physical infrastructures, amounting to Rs38.92 billion.The report said that 41 roads and highways were damaged. The estimated cost of repairing and maintaining the roads and highway infrastructure is Rs27.98 billion. Blocked or damaged roads hinder transportation and supply chains, complicating relief efforts and economic recovery.In the hydropower sector, the damage to 26 facilities has caused an estimated loss of Rs30.18 billion. This loss has significantly hit energy supply, impacting residential and industrial consumers.Nepal’s electricity imports are likely to surge this winter due to the delay in the reconstruction of hydropower plants. The 456MW Upper Tamakoshi hydropower project, Nepal’s largest in operation, has failed to resume generation since late September. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, 980MW of output has been interrupted.Similarly, damage to 446 telecommunication units has resulted in a loss of R152.30 million.The destruction of 1,678 federal and provincial water supply and sanitation systems has led to an estimated loss of Rs5.90 billion. The report said that the loss affects access to clean water and poses health risks, particularly in the wake of disasters that often exacerbate waterborne diseases.Forty-four bridges sustained damage, resulting in an estimated financial loss of Rs1.04 billion. The report said the damage severely hampers connectivity and affects transportation and logistics in the region.The social sector has experienced profound impacts, particularly in housing and settlements. As per initial reports, 5,996 houses were destroyed, while 13,049 were damaged. This destruction has displaced 10,807 families, impacting 16,243 individuals who are now living in public shelters and facing challenges in finding basic amenities, according to the report.Six infrastructures were fully destroyed in the health sector, and 43 health facilities were partially destroyed. This limits access to essential medical services during a critical time when health needs are heightened due to potential post-disaster health crises. The education sector has not been spared either, with six schools destroyed completely and 136 schools partially damaged, further disrupting education for countless children.There were 249 deaths and 178 injuries, and 18 persons are still missing, the report said. The highest number of fatalities have been reported in Dhading, followed by Kavre and Lalitpur districts. In terms of human impact, Bagmati reported the highest fatalities at 208, while Koshi saw 20 deaths. The report said over 17,000 individuals were rescued, and more than 14,800 police personnel were deployed across affected areas. The most extensive police operations were in Kathmandu Valley and several districts in the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces. In the productive sector, agriculture and livestock incurred substantial losses. The assessment indicates that 65,380 hectares of agricultural land and 26,698 livestock have been affected, resulting in an estimated economic loss of Rs5.88 billion. The report said that the significant impact on agriculture threatens food security and farmers' livelihoods, who rely heavily on their land and livestock for income.Seven irrigation projects have been affected, leading to a loss of Rs1.35 billion. The destruction of irrigation infrastructure jeopardises crop yields and exacerbates the agricultural crisis after the disasters.This assessment underscores the vulnerabilities of the affected sectors and the importance of comprehensive disaster preparedness and resilience-building measures to mitigate future risks.Bagmati province reported the most extensive damage, with 424 houses destroyed and 743 impacted.Bagmati province reported the highest levels of destruction, with 4,414 houses fully destroyed and 7,157 partially destroyed, affecting more than 14,517 families and displacing 9,997 families. Kavrepalanchok district was particularly hit, with 3,121 houses fully destroyed and 5,749 partially destroyed.  \n\nKaski residents have started redeveloping the Krapu Kwholasothar trail, a circuit trek of religious and historical significance that remains unexplored.Kwhlosothar, located 3,283 metres above sea level, is in the southern part of Annapurna and Lamjung. It can be reached through Tangting, Sikles, Kori and Yangjakot of Kaski and Pasgaun, Bhujung, and Ghanpokhari of Lamjung.The shortest route is from Tangting.Locals say it's not just an ordinary trekking trail for it connects Kwholasothar, an ancient village believed to be Nepal's first Gurung or Tamu settlement, with ruins of an ancient town over 1500-1200 years old.Until half a decade ago, northern Kaski and Lamjung locals used this route to bring salt from Tibet.A decade ago, a joint research team from Cambridge University of the UK and the Central Department of Geology, Tribhuvan University, studied the artefacts in Kwhlosothar.Bed Bahadur Gurung, a Gandaki provincial assembly member and former chairman of Madi rural municipality, said the trail has many historical and archaeological sites for pilgrimages for the Tamu [Gurung] people and could be an important historical attraction for Nepali and foreign trekkers.Kwhlosothar or Kohla Sothar is divided into three villages—lower, middle and upper. ‘Sothar’, in the Gurung language, means three villages. Locals and researchers say Kohla Sonthar resembles the 15th-century Inca ruins of Machu Pichu in Peru. For a long time, people have been demanding the area be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.“There are many historical artefacts, including houses and palaces, in these three villages,” said Gurung.There are caves after walking two hours more from Kwhlosothar at the height 3,800. ‘The cave is known as ‘Chamsyo Nagra.’Gurung remembers when his father brought salt via Tangting of Kwhlosothar-Namun Bhanjyang-Larke Pass-Tibet route five decades ago.When the road from Pokhara-Butwal opened, the people of Kwhlosothar stopped going along the mountainous route.No human settlement exists above Tangting, but many sheep and buffalo herders can be found there.Gurung said that before the Annapurna Conservation Area Project was established in 1985, foreign trekkers used to go for camping treks. However, since the project didn’t include the Kwhlosothar, trekkers stopped hiking in the area and remained isolated.The project promoted Manang, Lamjung, Thorong Pass, Mustanf, Myagfi and Annapurna Base Camp, Ghandruk-Ghorepani, but Kwhlosothar remained in the shadows.In Tony Hagen's book Building Bridges to the Third World: Memories of Nepal 1950-1992, the Swiss geologist mentions his travel experience to Namun Bhanjyang, from the base of Machapuchhre to Sikles, Madi River, and Krupudanda.The trail was named the ‘Tony Hagen Trail’ after Bed Bahadur Gurung became the chairman of the Madi rural municipality to promote it.“This trail needs to be redefined to allow people to know the historical importance of the place. The provincial and local governments and tourism entrepreneurs of Lamjung, Manang, and Kaski all need to play an equal role in promoting the area,” said Gurung.The Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment of Gandaki Province, Nepal Tourism Board office in Pokhara have been allocating a budget to promote trails in Madi in Kaski, Kwhlosothar of Lamjung and Chame of Manang. But on the promotional front, locals say nothing has been done.The Gurung Tourism Entrepreneurs Association has named the trekking route the Gurung Heritage Trail.“As trekking trails have been losing charm due to haphazard road construction, such trails are still untouched by modern development,” said Kisham Kumari Gurung, president of the association.“These trails can draw high-end trekkers, which can create jobs and increase the income of people in the areas,” said the president. “Gurung heritage trail has a combination of nature and culture.”Gurung heritage trekking trail has been developed from Tangting to Danda-Tapro-Kwhlosothar-Thulilek-Thurju-Dudh Pokhari-Gurung Deurali-Danfe Kharka-Timang to Besi Sahar, said Bobar Jung Gurung, founding president of the association. The association's members and others recently conducted a 10-day trekking trail exploration and promotion programme.The trekking trail includes Kwhlosothar (3,283 metres); Thulilek, a vast grazing area (4,070 metres); Dudh Pokhari, a religious place (4,585 metres); Namun Bhanjyang (5,560 metres); and Danfe Kharka, a yak grazing area (3,862 metres).The Annapurna Conservation Area Project and the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal coordinated the exploration. The trekking can be completed in 12 days.As a motor road has been reached to Ghandruk and Ghorepani of Annapurna Conservation Area, reducing the charm of trekking, the new trekking trail can be an alternative, said Deepak Sapkota, a member of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal, Gandaki.“In this area, we can revive camping trekking, which can be a big draw for trekkers.” \nAs the deadline to reduce 50 percent of existing deaths and disabilities from snakebites nears, herpetologists and public health experts emphasise the urgency for awareness and training for local health workers to meet this crucial health goal.They say that fatalities and disabilities from snakebites can be significantly reduced if vulnerable populations, especially children, women and farmers residing in rural areas, are made aware of the risks.“Along with the awareness, health workers serving at the local level should be trained to deal with snakebite cases,” said Dr Sanjib Kumar Sharma, rector at BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “Trained health workers can manage snakebite cases more effectively than others.”Snakebite, which kills hundreds of people every year, is a major public health scare in Nepal.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. Snakebite incidents are also common among cattle, and thousands of farmers are affected every year.The government has committed to reducing 50 percent of deaths and disabilities through snakebite envenomation by 2030, the national target aligned with the World Health Organisation’s ‘Snakebite Roadmap’.“The government has created a pool of doctors and experts for snakebite case management and master trainers,” said Sharma. “Along with other measures, authorities concerned should also focus on launching an awareness drive, which will make a huge difference in lessening overall snakebite incidents.”Moreover, along with awareness, identifying the snake will also be crucial for case management. Health workers ask the public to take photos of snakes if they are able to after they are bitten, which helps them identify the snake so that they can start treatment accordingly.“Archive of the photos of snakes available in the country should be maintained so that health workers could identify the snakes’ types and start treatment accordingly,” said Dr Sunita Ghimire, a molecular biologist. “Risk of deaths and disabilities increases due to inability to identify the snakes’ type.”Experts say authorities must also strengthen health infrastructures to achieve the target. They say due to poor infrastructure in healthcare facilities—lack of doctors, anti-snake venoms, ventilator support systems, and kidney dialysis facilities—dozens of people die from snakebite every year.While health facilities are ill-equipped and short on anti-snake venom, many people in rural areas lack awareness and often consult shamans instead of physicians.Doctors say women who go to the fields to collect fodder, farmers who do plantations or harvest, and children who play in open areas are more vulnerable to snakebite.Poor people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats, their fodder.Experts say there should be a greater awareness drive on keeping the houses and surroundings clean, preventing children from playing in the bushes and avoiding walking at night. If absolutely necessary, people must use torchlights while walking in the dark.Nepal imports polyvalent antivenom from India, which is effective against four common species of snakes found in India: the common cobra, common krait, saw-scaled viper, and Russell’s viper. Saw-scaled viper has not yet been found in the country.Deaths from pit viper bites in the hills and mountainous regions have also risen recently. However, the antivenom made for other venomous snakes does not treat pit viper’s case. \nAt least 23 died, including one in Kathmandu Valley, and over 80 people have been infected with the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since June this year.The number of reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as tests were carried out only on those hospitalised patients after their conditions got severe, officials say.“The death rate from the Japanese encephalitis infection is the highest among the vaccine-preventable diseases,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division. “Relevant health agencies have been taking all necessary measures to prevent infection and deaths from the virus.”Cases of the deadly viral disease have been reported in 30 districts of six provinces except Karnali. What concerns health officials is the death rate rising alarmingly every year—around 29 percent in the current fiscal year. Fatality among children under 15 years is very high while complications from JE infection could cause permanent injuries to the brain and the nervous system.Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection, endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organisation, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to a half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Data from the health ministry show that less than 50 percent of the infected patients were found inoculated with the vaccine. Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines have been developed to prevent infection. Health officials, however, said that their attempts to convince development partners, including the World Health Organisation, for a mass JE vaccination campaign have not succeeded.“We have raised the issue several times with officials from the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation and requested their support,” said Lal. “But as of now, none of the agencies is convinced to support JE vaccination. Either the government has to decide and secure the funding source, or the aid agency should invest in the JE vaccination.”The National Immunisation Advisory Committee, an expert panel, has also not recommended mass JE vaccination despite the high mortality rate.“Vaccine does not help in controlling the ongoing epidemic,” said Dr Ramesh Kanta Adhikari, senior immunisation expert and a National Immunisation Advisory Committee member. “We are ready to carry out a feasibility study, hold review meetings and discussions with the concerned experts and stakeholders to recommend the JE vaccination campaign if the government decides the same.”In 2005, JE killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the Tarai districts. Nepal started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organisation officially issued prequalification certification, due to high rates of infection and deaths from the virus at the time.In the first phase, all populations of the highly affected four districts—Banke, Bardiya, Dang, and Kailali—were given the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into routine immunisation in 2015. Even then, people still die, and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.The Ministry of Health and Population said its attention has been drawn to the spread of a deadly virus that has killed around two dozen people and infected scores of others.“I have called a meeting of the officials concerned from the Family Welfare Division to discuss the issue on Friday,” said Pradip Paudel, minister for health and population. “We have taken the issue seriously and will make some decisions to prevent deaths and infections from the JE virus.”Public health experts say this is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk. Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity against future infections. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise avoiding mosquito bites, such as by using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or travels to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal. \nA team of senior health officials from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, who were deployed recently in Gandaki Province to assess the latest situation of the dengue spread, returned with complaints. Along with health workers serving at local bodies and provincial hospitals, elected representatives and local leaders of political parties, with whom they discussed, complained about exorbitant testing charges at private laboratories.“We are aware of the excessive prices being charged by private labs for dengue testing and held discussions about setting a maximum price but couldn't reach a decision,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “For the next dengue season, we would make a decision about slashing the testing charges.”Nepal has been witnessing a rapid surge in new cases of dengue infection in recent months. Health authorities, however, do not concede that the number of new dengue cases is rising alarmingly. Doctors say there could be dengue patients in almost all households, especially in the Kathmandu Valley and in major cities like Pokhara.Officials say that state-run health facilities do not charge for dengue testing, and they are aware of excessive charging by private labs despite the significant decline in the cost of rapid diagnostic test kits.“It cost less than 100 rupees for a rapid diagnostic testing kit, but private labs have been charging excessively,” an official at the Department of Health Services said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “Due to a lack of regulation, private labs and hospitals have been fleecing patients, and health officials have been avoiding making decisions to appease the private laboratories and hospitals.”Public health experts say that it was obvious for patients to bear brunt when the authorities concerned, including the health minister, focus on gaining popularity by announcing populist programmes that are not feasible to implement with existing resources.“Some hospitals have been charging up to Rs 3,000 for dengue tests,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “When the authorities forget their prime duties and fear antogonising private hospitals and labs, it is inevitable that patients will suffer.”Most state run health facilities and labs remained closed during Tihar holidays, which forced infected patients to seek services at private hospitals. Meanwhile, the Department of Health Services said that its attention has been drawn to the excessive charging for dengue testing at private labs.“I have noted the issue and will discuss it with the Health Ministry,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We will make some decisions regarding this issue.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.So far, only 12 people have died, and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often concealed the actual number of deaths and infections.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nIn rural Madhesh, where cultural norms and limited access to healthcare compound an already fragile health infrastructure, women’s sexual and reproductive health needs are often sidelined.For many women there, awareness of their own bodies and health needs remains a distant reality. Seeking help for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues is often a last resort.Seema Kumari Pasman, a 20-year-old from Karmahi village in Dhanusha who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy, is one such example.Married at 16 in 2019, she quickly became a mother of two children by 2022.After two child births, her menstrual complications worsened, yet she had no frame of reference to understand that what she was experiencing—menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding—was a medical condition.Pasman endured a year of painful, prolonged periods that she had been taught were simply part of a woman’s life—a burden, not a condition needing treatment.Daily chores became unbearable for her but those around her continued to dismiss her symptoms.One night in December 2023, after collapsing while fetching water from a hand pump, Pasman’s family rushed her to Janakpur Provincial Hospital.There, doctors diagnosed her with severe anaemia from untreated menorrhagia. “The doctors told me that if I had received earlier intervention, my suffering could have been prevented...but I only thought it was normal,” Pasman says.The culture of silence around SRH issues means that women like Pasman get help only when their conditions are critical.A 2018 study in the Journal of Health and Allied Sciences reported low awareness of SRH rights among 384 married Madheshi women in Sarlahi. Three-fifths were unaware of these rights, and the same proportion reported experiences of physical and dowry-related violence.Chandra Rekha Issar, a gynaecologist at Janakpur Provincial Hospital and assistant professor at the Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences (MIHS), says that for many women, the concept of openly talking about SRH—especially with male doctors—is almost unthinkable.In rural Madhesh, as part of ‘ghunghat pratha’, married women have limited interaction with unrelated men outside their family. They are often expected to wear a veil in front of everyone except their husbands and rarely go outside alone for extended periods.This restrictive environment creates a hesitation among women to discuss their SRH. When these women visit a gynaecologist and are assigned a male doctor, it often leads to discomfort.Health consultations can thus become uncomfortable or are avoided altogether, exacerbating a pattern of undiagnosed and untreated conditions.At Janakpur Hospital, this cultural barrier plays out every single day.Kamala Devi Mandal, a 30-year-old woman from Khariyani, Janakpur, sat clutching her veil in the waiting area of the Department of Gynaecology, with her mother in law on the side.When her turn came, Mandal hesitated upon seeing a male gynaecologist, Raj Kishor Pandit, at the door. Despite a female attendant’s presence, Mandal’s mother-in-law ultimately did the talking, while Kamala remained silent, visibly uncomfortable.For Issar, these hesitations are all too familiar. She works alongside male gynaecologists in a department where only four of the 13 doctors are female.“In a setting where women are uncomfortable speaking about reproductive issues, especially with male doctors, we have to proceed carefully, often through the person accompanying the patient,” she says.Most of the female patients are accompanied by family members, as husbands are often working abroad.For something as basic as the date of their last menstrual cycle, the patient often defers to the person accompanying her. “Most of them are under a veil,” Issar added, “and removing it, even for an eye check to assess anaemia, takes coaxing… It requires long counselling for women to open up. At times, the information we receive is incomplete, which creates challenges in treatment.”If patients still hesitate to see a male gynaecologist after counselling, a female gynaecologist is assigned when possible, says Issar. However, this is often unfeasible during busy hours due to limited staff compared to the high patient load.Gynecologist Issar says that about 85 percent of the hospital’s gynaecology and obstetrics cases involve pregnancy-related complications, often worsened by malnutrition, lack of prenatal care, and early marriages.General gynaecology accounts for 15 percent of patients, with menstrual issues like dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding common among adolescents under 19, while older patients face infections, cervical cancer, and uterine prolapse.Due to early marriages, multiple childbirths, and home deliveries without medical supervision, many women develop uterine prolapse—a condition typically seen in older women but increasingly common in those as young as 30 in rural Madhesh.The gendered expectations that govern interactions in rural Madhesh leave women ill-equipped to advocate for their health.“During a health camp in Saptari, I found that over ten percent of women under 35 had uterine prolapse,” Issar says. “Early marriage and childbirth in an environment without health education or postnatal care have serious consequences.”The barriers also include outdated beliefs and superstitions which affect women’s diet and recovery after childbirth.“Although the situation has improved, women in remote Madhesh are often prohibited from consuming protein-rich foods like chicken soup or meat after giving birth,” says 24 year old Sapana Ray, a bachelor’s student in public health at Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences. “They are typically allowed only one meal of roti and are discouraged from more water and meal, as it’s believed that this prevents colds and other illnesses in the child,” Ray added, “This lack of nutrition contributes to malnutrition and anaemia, exacerbating their health issues.”When rural women lack basic health literacy, common gynaecological issues go unchecked, leading to preventable complications. For instance, over 80 percent of cases at Janakpur Provincial Hospital are critical.“Most of these severe cases could have been prevented with early intervention or just an understanding of basic health,” Issar says.As Issar sees it, comprehensive awareness campaigns are crucial for educating women about sexual and reproductive health.“The government should consider monthly outreach programmes in rural areas. Women in far rural communities need direct, consistent health education,” Issar says. Further, local health posts with trained personnel could provide preventive care and answer questions women may hesitate to bring up in a hospital setting.The hospital’s efforts to include female attendants in male doctors’ consultations and to counsel women on gender-neutral healthcare only go so far. Often, patients’ deep-seated fears and hesitation prove challenging to overcome.While Madhesh’s women struggle with silence and a lack of resources, healthcare professionals are left piecing together fragmented stories, trying to heal patients who are often reluctant to share their suffering. It is a race against time and tradition.Dr Issar says that it’s unfair to blame women for hesitating to discuss their issues with gynaecologists. “We need to understand and empathise with their background,” she says.Many women, living in conservative settings, rarely have the freedom to speak openly. Given this, she questions, “How can we expect them to feel fully comfortable discussing their sexual and reproductive health, especially with a male doctor?” Even for educated urban women, she adds, these conversations can be challenging.According to Ray, consistent ground-level awareness and counselling programmes on SRH are essential, alongside changes to the conservative and predominantly patriarchal settings in rural areas. “These social barriers, even more than medical intervention, are often the primary obstacles to healthcare access for women in these communities,” she says. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a five-day trout festival offering twelve unique dishes from various cuisines, showcasing the versatility and nutritional benefits of locally sourced trout.\nInspired by cooking shows, a child's passion for baking leads to experimentation, learning the science behind it, and sharing tips for successful home-baking, including oven types, ingredients, leavening agents, and techniques.\nThe Stonewall Riots in New York City sparked the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement, leading to inclusive spaces like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu, which provides a safe haven and promotes acceptance for the queer community.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra, recipient of the James Beard Foundation Scholarship, promotes Nepali cuisine through his restaurant \"The Sewing Tin\" in New York, blending Nepali flavors with modern culinary techniques and aspiring to elevate Nepali food globally.\nCeleus Baral, an environment science student and avid baker, runs Bakeleus, an online baking shop that sells a variety of baked goods, advocating for a zero-waste policy and incorporating her passion for nature and environmental consciousness into her creations.\nKhokana, a serene village near Kathmandu, preserves its ancient lifestyle and architecture despite urban expansion, offering historical sites like Sikali Temple and mustard oil mills, and a glimpse into the Kathmandu Valley's medieval past.\nAmidst the challenges of filming in a changing climate on Turkey's snowy highlands, a producer embarks on a solo trek to Everest Base Camp, discovering resilience and inspiration in the face of obstacles and the fragility of life.\nA six-day tour of Sri Lanka covered a significant portion of the island, highlighting religious sites, natural wonders, tea estates, the Galle Fort, and the Southern Expressway.\nMundhum Trek passes through indigenous villages in Khotang and Bhojpur, Janaki Mandir is a large temple in Janakpur, Kuri Village is a scenic destination with snow in Kalinchowk, Annapurna Base Camp offers a picturesque journey to the foothills of Annapurna South, Bardiya National Park is home to Royal Bengal Tigers, Khaptad National Park is a pristine protected area in Sudurpaschim Province, and Limi Valley provides stunning views of the Himalayas.\nA nostalgic return to Phidim reveals a transformed hometown, marked by advancements and departures, balancing memories with the inevitability of change.\nNepal's loss to the UAE in the U-19 Women's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier puts them at a disadvantage but their hopes of qualifying remain alive with crucial fixtures against the UAE and other teams.\nIndia beat South Africa by 61 runs in the first T20I, thanks to a brilliant 107 from Sanju Samson, with Varun Chakravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi leading the bowling attack with three wickets each.\nQatar has suspended mediation efforts between Hamas and Israel due to lack of progress, and press reports on Hamas' political office in Doha are inaccurate.\nFrom kite-making competitions to love letters soaring high, Kathmandu's kite season, celebrated during Dashain and Nag Panchami, was a vibrant and social event, where kites adorned the skies and brought joy to both fliers and spectators, but urbanization and the advent of modern entertainment options have led to a decline in this cultural tradition.\nMatina Shakya, appointed Kumari in 2008, succeeded by Trishna Shakya in 2017, is now studying management, while the Kumari tradition has evolved to provide Kumaris with education and support, gradually abolishing superstition and stigma.\nJuddha Shumsher's private zoo, begun in 1932, housed a diverse collection of animals, including lions, tigers, rhinos, deer, monkeys, birds, and exotic creatures like crocodiles and porcupines.\nSayyid Abbas Araghchi, a veteran diplomat, was confirmed by the Iranian parliament as foreign minister upon recommendation from newly-elected President Masoud Pezeshkian, who advocates smoothing relations with the West while facing challenges with Azerbaijan, Turkey, the IRGC, and ongoing Israeli offensives.\nDonald Trump overcame them all. A felon convicted 34 times over. A pair of assassination attempts. Endorsement of Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival, by major news organisations and Hollywood A-listers. The baggage of history, whereby in the past 100 years just one other person had won a non-consecutive American presidential election. The opposition’s message that Trump harboured fascist tendencies, that he was openly misogynistic, that he had no concrete plan besides the vacuous ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan—they all fell on deaf ears. On election eve, most Americans said the economy was their top priority and they seem to have voted accordingly—never mind that the US continues to be the best performing rich economy, by a long shot. Whatever the state of the overall economy, many Americans felt their personal lives were getting worse. Harris also clearly failed to kindle hope as first-time voters, especially young men, leaned towards Trump. Arab-Americans were unhappy with US President Joe Biden’s handling of the war in Palestine, and Vice-president Harris seems to have lost many of their votes as a result. It was also interesting that more Americans saw in Trump a better presidential material than they did in Harris.So what does Trump’s triumph mean, especially for the rest of the democratic world? A few lessons emerge. One, it reinforces the message that voters are far from rational creatures and tend to vote with their hearts. Logically, compared to 2020, more Blacks voting for Trump, someone who harbours white supremacist views, does not make sense. Nor does the fact of Arab-Americans voting for Trump, who is likely to be worse when it comes to protecting the rights of the Palestinians. Even more generally, why would you choose someone who neither has the temperament nor the credentials to handle arguably the most important job in the world? But, again, in this age of social media, hard logic alone is insufficient. For example, many first-time male voters said they were persuaded to vote for Trump after watching 30-second Republican messages on TikTok. And most Americans think they are worse off today than they were four years ago, despite many indications to the contrary. Concomitantly, by appealing to people’s baser instincts, a lying Trump could capture many more votes than a rather wooden but more truthful Harris.As in the US, there is a lot of disgruntlement in Nepal, especially among the youth. They feel cheated by old parties and their ageing leaders. Yet newer parties have also failed to gain their trust. Currently, it is unclear what this state of perpetual disgruntlement will lead to. Another Bangladesh, some suspect. People are looking for options to the status quo. Again, as in the US, a strongman may emerge in order to tap into this deep sense of frustration. Like Trump’s tropes, the message of these strongmen will be simple yet emotionally-laden and hence easy to gulp down in a world increasingly drowned in confusing online chatter. We often take our liberties for granted. But as the appeal of ‘democratic strongmen’ like Trump grows far and wide, those freedoms may come under jeopardy. If the US, with its strong history of check and balance, is struggling to manage a single man’s challenge to democracy, a country like Nepal with its weak institutions will be a lot more vulnerable to despotism.   \nSince taking office around three months ago, Health Minister Pradip Paudel has announced several initiatives focused on free healthcare programmes. Although these announcements appear laudable at the outset, those acquainted with our healthcare system suspect they will do more harm than good. Such a spree of free healthcare programmes is impractical in a nation where funding for even basic health facilities is scarce. Isn’t the availability of facilities a prerequisite for making them “free” to the public?Last week, Minister Paudel announced three free programmes, including free treatment for cancer patients under 14. A week before that, Paudel had pledged free care for burn victims who cannot afford treatment. But how will these be executed as hospitals lack vital resources? Every year, around 1,500 children under 14 have cancer. Many have no option but to travel abroad for treatment due to a lack of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, immunohistochemistry, bone marrow transplants and other important tests. Moreover, there is a severe shortage of support staff in health facilities. On burn care, most health facilities only provide basic treatments, compromising patient safety even as, according to the ministry, around 57,000 people are affected by it every year.Without proper budget allocation, such ambitious programmes are bound to fail. In the budget for the current fiscal year, the health sector received Rs86.24 billion, which was only a 2.5 percent increase from the previous fiscal year. With only 4.6 percent of the total budget dedicated to healthcare, experts warned about its long-term impacts, potentially affecting crucial milestones achieved over the years. Several healthcare programmes, including those related to safe motherhood, child health, nutrition, and mental health, were already impeded by the cut in the previous year’s budget. What’s more, the agencies under the ministry don’t even have the funds to provide something as basic as mental health screening training to children and adolescents. While the health minister unveils one free programme after another, the agencies under the ministry seek funds from aid agencies to carry them forward. At a press conference 100 days after assuming office, Paudel claimed that federal hospitals are now better organised and he would now focus on health insurance reform. However, his promise to do away with long waiting lines at state hospitals within a month and raise the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 have yet to be realised. Such long queues reflect the poor healthcare accessibility, with facilities mostly Kathmandu-centric. Over the years, patient numbers have increased exponentially, even while there has been no rise in human resources in state-run hospitals in the past three decades. All of these reflect how misguided and superficial these health-related commitments are. In yet another example of incompetence, the health ministry released a circular in September to operate outpatient services on public holidays. How is this sustainable in a system where doctors are already overworked and offered no extra incentives?Perhaps the health minister should focus more on using available funds to push the current healthcare programmes than on starting more ambitious initiatives. Nepalis have had their fill of populist vows that disregard their well-being, especially in an area as basic as healthcare. Government representatives would do well not to make lofty promises that adds burden on our already overworked healthcare providers.  \nLow-quality goods and price manipulation are rampant in Nepali markets. Are the milk and butter we are buying fresh? What about rice, lentils, noodles and other goods in groceries? And are we being sold fake sneakers and jeans slapped with the labels of popular brands? Also, who among us has not been frustrated when we order one thing online and something completely different arrives? It’s frustrating. But there is hope on the horizon. Starting December, the government plans to establish a consumer court in Kathmandu to hear the consumers’ grievances and complaints against unethical market practices. The court is finally coming into being, nearly three years after a Supreme Court directive. Consumer protection in Nepal has for long been overlooked. The Consumer Protection Act 2018 did mandate the establishment of consumer courts, but there were significant delays in its implementation. This in turn emboldened unscrupulous traders and led to the proliferation of their businesses. Meanwhile, Nepali consumers, long used to getting shoddy deals, have long since stopped complaining. But the new court will allow them to resolve even minor issues quickly and effectively within a specialised setting guided by judges who are experts in consumer law. Consumers only need a bill of goods and services to file a case and they will not have to wait long for a hearing.But there is also bad news. This service is only limited to the federal capital, Kathmandu, which will initially hear cases from Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. Plans are underway for an extension to other districts and provinces, but officials fear lack of adequate budget and bureaucratic hurdles may hinder such an expansion. Some local units have acted against malpractices and punished businesspersons who cheat on customers, but these initiatives are insufficient. What we really need is a nationwide network of consumer courts. Last fiscal year alone, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control filed 178 cases in the District Administration Office, Kathmandu. These cases were related to processed drinking water, food items, lentils, sweet items, oil and ghee, milk and dairy items, and spices. The department recorded many cases of substandard products produced by major brands like Bhat-Bhateni food products, Dabur Nepal, CG Oil and Derivatives and Pokhara Noodles. These businesses were found to be flouting Nepal’s consumer laws and compromising people’s health. Consumer protection provisions were thus due. Now that the country is embarking on the journey of establishing consumer courts, there should be no further delays. Expansion of the courts beyond the confines of Kathmandu Valley should not be a big problem too. We hear of large chunks of budgets of all three levels of government in Nepal going unspent every single year. What better way to spend the money than in ensuring that people get value for their money—at a time unjustified price hikes and selling of fakes is giving them a lot of headache? This is why United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection recognise the “access to and availability dispute resolution and redress mechanism as a basic need of consumers”. That is also among people’s basic rights as taxpayers.  \nFrequent plane crashes, natural disasters, poor infrastructure and bureaucratic challenges—they all ail Nepali tourism. There is a dire need to ramp up efforts to get it on track. But then we as a country are taking a step back when the rest of the world is looking to boost tourism with robust plans and policies. The Civil Aviation Authority’s latest decision to close Tribhuvan International Airport—Nepal’s only ariel gateway for foreign tourists and the sole door of opportunities for millions of its citizens—for 10 hours (10 pm to 8 am) to complete a long-overdue taxiway expansion, has garnered national and international criticism for the strain it will put on the country’s tourism.While there is nothing wrong with the project to renovate taxiways that have worn out from years of use, the authorities perhaps didn’t consider its impact on tourism and passengers seriously. The airport closure from November 8 to March 31 is bound to inconvenience foreign visitors as it coincides with both autumn and spring peak trekking seasons. Festivals, family reunions, holidays and favourable weather make this season the perfect time to travel to Nepal. Such a prolonged halt will only dampen people’s enthusiasm. One is left wondering why such a vital time was chosen for these renovations.The financial repercussions are substantial. The Nepal Tourism Board, which had aimed for 1.3 million tourists this year, has cut down the expected number to 1.1 million. This could lead to a revenue loss of around Rs50 billion for the airline and tourism industry. Indirect cost could be many times higher. International airlines have cut flights or cancelled tickets at short notice, taking airfares to all-time highs. For instance, the most popular destination in November, Sydney, which would have cost Rs85,000 on normal days, will now cost Rs217,000 (for the highest priced tickets) and Rs114,000 (lowest). For average Nepali workers and students, these fares are unaffordable. Tourism entrepreneurs are facing losses as hotels are reporting cancellations.In 2019, for the same project, the airport was closed for seven hours (11:30 pm to 6:30 am) after which 24/7 operations began for the first time to compensate for the lost flight hours. Earlier this year, too, for the very project, landings from the northern side of the airport were barred, but there were no airport closures. Given these precedents, one would have expected more robust planning this time. Instead, it seems there has not been enough homework. The civil aviation authorities’ efforts to manage the Kathmandu airport’s congestion by redirecting traffic to Pokhara and Gautam Buddha international airports have also failed because no foreign airline operator is willing to fly to these destinations. Travel trade entrepreneurs lament that this “unplanned construction” is taking too long and fear it might extend to spring, another peak tourist season. This is understandable given Nepal’s poor record in completing roads and infrastructure. They have also urged the authorities to limit the shutdown to five hours. However, that risks further delaying the project. A balanced approach that prioritises tourism and passengers while ensuring timely completion is the best. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) request that the authorities shorten the closure or spare high-traffic days is logical. Halting operations at peak arrival and departure is neither wise nor sustainable. Ultimately, the health of the country’s civil aviation is closely linked to the state of its regulator. Right now, it appears that our top aviation officials are working more for themselves than for the benefit of the intended beneficiaries.  \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast partly cloudy skies in Nepal’s hilly areas on Sunday, with fair to partly cloudy conditions across the rest of the country.
