Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe Patan High Court on Wednesday acquitted cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane of rape.Overturning the verdict of the Kathmandu District Court, a division of bench of judges Surya Darshan Dev Bhatta and Anju Uprety Dhakal gave a clean chit to Lamichhane, who was on suspension from the national cricket team. The high court cited lack of evidence while overturning the decision of its subordinate court.“The verdict from the district court has been fully overturned,” said Tirtharaj Bhattarai, spokesperson at the High Court. “The defendant Sandeep Lamichhane has been acquitted.”A single bench of district judge Shishir Raj Dhakal on December 29, 2023 had convicted Lamichhane of rape, but the penalty was determined later, on January 10. The court had ordered a jail term and fine of half a million rupees for the alleged rape, which is said to have occurred in August 2022. The half a million rupees—of which Rs300,000 is fine and the remaining compensation—would be paid to the victim, the court had ordered.The jail term and penalty were determined considering the age of Gaushala-26 (the name given to the victim), the social status of the accused when the incident happened and the mental stress the victim had to suffer. The court, however, had dismissed the victim’s claim that she was a minor at the time of incident. The court had also refused to accept the birth dates mentioned in her academic documents, which show she was 17 at the time of the incident.Not satisfied with the order, the district attorney and Lamichhane had moved the high court. While the district attorney had challenged the decision that refused to accept the victim as a minor, Lamichhane had denied the charge and demanded acquittal. The high court has now passed a verdict as demanded by Lamichhane.“The division bench has refused to accept that the victim was a minor as claimed by the government side,” said Bhattarai. “It also found insufficient evidence to pronounce him guilty.” The detailed basis for the acquittal will be explained in the verdict’s full text, which will be issued later, according to the court official.The lawyers, who deliberated from the victim’s side, claim the way the questions were put before Gaushala-26 during the hearing had indicated that Lamichanne would be acquitted. “His celebrity status prevailed over justice. I am extremely sad to witness this,” said advocate Mohna Ansari, who had advocated on the victim’s behalf. “This is a good example of miscarriage of justice.”The high court’s ruling can be challenged in the Supreme Court. Generally, the government attorney challenges the decision of the lower courts in the top court if they don’t pass a favourable verdict .“We hope the government side will challenge the high court’s verdict at the Supreme Court,” said Ansari who also is a former member of the National Human Rights Commission. “Otherwise, the victim herself can appeal, which she will be doing.”Lamichhane was accused of raping the girl in a Kathmandu’s Tilganga-based hotel on August 21, 2022. After hearing the lawyers on both sides, the district court ruled “there was no dispute that Lamichhane and the victim had stayed in the same room of the hotel where she was raped.” It had claimed that the accused had raped the victim by taking advantage of her poor economic condition and misusing his stardom.During the months-long hearing, the court also examined different documents of the victim relating to her age.After examining Gaushala 26’s birth registration at Raluka VDC, Nuwakot; migration registration at Shankarapur Municipality, Kathmandu; birth registration at Narayani Sub-regional Hospital, Birgunj; and her own statement, the district court had determined that she was born on July 4, 2004, and was 18 years old when the alleged incident happened. Despite overturning the decision of penalty determined by the district court, the high court has reached the same conclusion when it comes to the age of the victim.Gaushala-26 had lodged her complaint against Lamichhane on September 6, 2022, two weeks after the incident.When the investigation started, Lamichhane was in the West Indies to play in the Caribbean Premier League. He was arrested from the Tribhuvan International Airport upon his return on October 6, 2022.On November 4 last year, the Kathmandu District Court ordered that Lamichhane be sent to the Sundhara-based Central Jail after a detention hearing.Lamichhane had moved the high court, challenging the order.On January 12, a division bench of high court judges Dhruva Raj Nanda and Ramesh Dahal decided to release him on bail while the investigation continued. Following the verdict, Lamichhane was released from custody on January 13 after posting a bail of two million rupees. The court, however, had barred him from travelling abroad and ordered him to inform the police beforehand if he had to leave Kathmandu.Dissatisfied with the travel restrictions, Lamichhane moved the Supreme Court, challenging the high court’s decision. On February 27, a division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Kumar Chudal had ruled in favour of the cricketer’s petition, allowing him to travel abroad to play cricket.Despite being convicted, Lamichhane didn’t face jail as he was allowed to appeal without being behind bars. Meanwhile, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) on Wednesday lifted its suspension of former national cricket captain Lamichhane, paving the way for his return to the national team and the T20 World Cup squad.The decision to lift the suspension came hours after the Patan High Court acquitted Lamichhane of rape on appeal, overturning the verdict of the Kathmandu District Court to sentence him to eight years in jail.“As the Patan High Court has issued a verdict on May 15, 2024, giving Sandeep Lamichhane a clean chit, we have decided to lift his suspension from all forms of domestic and international cricketing activities,” CAN said in a statement.The lifting of suspension has now paved the way for Lamichhane to travel to the West Indies and the United States to take part in the World Cup.Nepal have already announced a provisional 15-member squad for the 2024 T20 World Cup but are allowed to make changes to the initial selections until May 25.CAN has already started preparations to send Lamichhane to the World Cup, according to CAN treasurer Padam Khadka.Lamichhane was in Trinidad & Tobago to play in the Caribbean Premier League from Jamaica Tallawahs when “Gaushala 26” filed the rape complaint.Following the rape charge and subsequent arrest warrant issued by the Kathmandu District Court, CAN had dismissed Lamichhane as national captain and suspended him from cricket.He returned to the national team in February last year and participated in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 home tri-series against Namibia and Scotland, after he was freed on bail.He also travelled to Zimbabwe in June last year to participate in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier and to India to play the 2023 Asia Cup three months later.However, he was suspended from cricketing activities again following Kathmandu District Court’s verdict.“I have said from the first day that I am innocent. I am grateful to those who supported me,” Lamichhane said after getting the clean chit.“I will make every effort to take Nepali cricket to a new height.” \nNepal’s two biggest parties are making scathing criticism of each other.Senior coalition partner CPN-UML and the main opposition Nepali Congress, which is the largest party in the House of Representatives, have trained their guns on each other over the recent Supreme Court verdict on a multi-billion-rupee land swap scam.After the Supreme Court on May 12 issued the full text of its verdict related to the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate, at the prime location of Birtamod in Jhapa, the Congress demanded an investigation into those involved in making the decision on the land swap.Terming the court verdict as historic, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa posted a statement on social media on Tuesday, saying: “It has now been proven that the then government’s decision was wrong … Therefore, there should be further investigation against those involved.”The Supreme Court on February 7 overturned the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli government's decision. On April 26, 2021, the Oli-led government allowed the use of the land exempting the ceiling for the deal. However, the constitutional bench, headed by Bishowambar Prasad Shrestha, ruled that Oli’s Cabinet decision contravened Section 12 (C) of the Land Act 1964 and was immature.The court also ruled against allowing the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding the legal ownership ceiling in any other place within Koshi Province, highlighting the legal implications of the land reforms.The requirement to first examine the specific land’s detailed area has been upheld by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench in the full text of the verdict. The land that is being considered for a swap ought to yield comparable value, read the court’s final verdict. But the tea estate is trying to swap its land in Birtamod, reportedly valued at Rs200 million per bigha, with low-price land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.While considering a swap, there must be a feasibility study to assess the new location’s production capacity. Technical experts’ advice ought to be followed in this context, reads the full text of the court.“It [the court verdict] has not just confirmed how wrong and corrupt the decisions and law amendments made by the government of the time were, but has also exposed policy-level corruption. There is no longer any doubt that such a decision is unfair and ill-intended. Therefore, further investigation is warranted,” Thapa wrote. When the Congress general secretary tried to bash the UML over the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate incident, UML chair Oli accused the Congress of selling 70 bighas of the estate in return for hefty commissions. Oli made the accusation while addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the UML on Wednesday. “The Congress should be careful when commenting on the UML on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate,” Oli said. “They once sold 51 bighas of land and later 19 bighas in the name of land swapping, just for commissions.”When the government in 2018 tried to swap the Giri Bandhu land, the court stopped it, saying there were no legal provisions to do so. “Abiding by the court’s ruling, we later formulated the law, but the court now has found the fault with it,” Oli said.The Congress has been cornering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane over his involvement in the co-operatives funds’ embezzlement. With this agenda the party also has been disrupting Parliament. But the ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being biassed against Lamichhane. And it is Oli and his CPN-UML party that has come to Lamichhane’s most resolute defence.The Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday decided to take up the issue of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in a serious manner.But Congress leaders deny that bringing up the tea estate issue is its calculated strategy to corner the ruling parties. “The parliamentary party meeting decided to take up this issue given the gravity of the matter. There is no ulterior motive,” Sanjay Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post. Meanwhile, Gautam also said the party will study Oli’s allegations against his party. When the Oli government amended laws related to land-swapping, Thapa of the Congress, who demanded an investigation into the Oli Cabinet’s decision, was a House member. Not only Thapa but most senior Congress leaders were members of Parliament at the time of the amendment.“Though one can question those involved in the law amendment on moral grounds, they cannot be held accountable on legal grounds,” Om Parkash Aryal, an advocate who was among those challenging the Oli government’s decision in the court, told the Post. “In such instances, it’s the government that makes such a decision which comes under the question.”King Mahendra’s implementation of land reforms in 2021 BS, through enacting the Land Act 2021 BS, was a momentous step. The law fixed the ceiling of land possession by individuals at 28 bighas in Tarai districts. The land exceeding the ceiling would be nationalised. Landlords close to the then royal palace were taken into confidence for the law’s implementation, and the palace made it clear that land used for industrial and agricultural purposes would not be nationalised.According to Section 12 of the Land Act 2021, land used for industrial, agricultural, cooperative farming, educational, or medical purposes is not put under the limit.Budhkaran Rajbanshi, a landlord in Jhapa considered close to the royal palace, was informed in prior that if he established a tea estate, the land beyond the ceiling would not be nationalised.To save his land, he founded the Budhkaran Tea Estate there. Three additional Jhapa landlords, the Giri brothers (Prem Kumar Giri, Krishna Kumar Giri, and Trilochan Giri) also received similar information. In Birtamod, Jhapa, the Giri brothers owned 500 bighas. Before the Land Reforms Act came into effect, the Giri brothers proceeded to register the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in order to safeguard the property. Land reform laws introduced later did not apply to the land as it had already been used for agricultural purposes. \nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday issued an interlocutory interim order against the decision of the Election Commission to register the Ashok Rai-led group as a party.Responding to a writ petition filed by Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal) Chairman Upendra Yadav, a single bench of Justice Binod Sharma ordered the election body to put the party registration process on hold, for now.Yadav on Monday moved the apex court, challenging the election body's decision to recognise the JSP-Nepal’s splinter group as a party. In his petition, Yadav accused the commission of registering the party despite its failure to meet the criteria, that is support of 40 percent of members both from the party’s central committee and the parliamentary party.Though Rai was supported by seven of the party's 12 lawmakers, he showed the support of only 30 members of the central committee. According to officials at the election body, the Yadav-led party has 406 members in its central committee.Yadav had named the Election Commission and others as defendants and has demanded that the commission’s decision to give recognition to the newly formed party be scrapped. Yadav has also sought a mandamus order from the apex court demanding that the status of the defecting leaders as lawmakers be scrapped.An interlocutory interim order has been issued to put the decisions taken on May 6 and thereafter on hold as it seems appropriate to reach a conclusion only after following the discussions with the Election Commission, the bench said.The court has summoned both the parties for a next hearing on May 21.On May 5, Ashok Rai, the federal council chair of the Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal), along with six other lawmakers and 30 central committee members of the party split the JSP-Nepal to form a new outfit Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP). The JSP-Nepal had altogether 12 lawmakers in the House of Representatives.The Rai-led faction submitted an application to the Election Commission to register the new party on May 5. The next day, the election body registered the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.As the legal provisions in the Political Parties Act relating to the formation of a new party after a split in an existing one have been invalidated, the commission registered the new party as per the regulation on political parties.On August 18, 2021, the then Sher Bahadur Deuba government had issued an ordinance to amend the Act to ease the split of two parties—the CPN-UML and the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal.Revising a provision in the Act, which requires the support of 40 percent members both in the parliamentary party and the central committee in order to split a party, the ordinance lowered the bar to 20 percent in any one of the committees.On August 26 that year, Madhav Kumar Nepal of the UML and Mahantha Thakur of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal registered new parties, the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, respectively.Two days later, the ordinance was repealed, having served its purpose. The provisions amended by the ordinance have become void after it was repealed. Though a bill to reactivate the provisions of the Act has been registered in Parliament, it is yet to be endorsed. \nNepal and Lithuania established diplomatic ties in February 2005. Nepal designated its Embassy in Copenhagen (Denmark) as a non-resident mission to Lithuania, and the Lithuanian Embassy in New Delhi represents Lithuania in Nepal. There have been minimal contacts and exchanges between the two countries. Trade, tourism and investment relations between the two countries are at a very low level. The Post caught up with Diana Mickeviciene, the ambassador of Lithuania to India, during her recent visit to Nepal to discuss Lithuania’s cutting-edge technology and its graduation to a developed economy, as well as bilateral economic, trade and tourism relations between the two small nations. Excerpts:Tell us about the bilateral economic and trade relations between Nepal and Lithuania.We are both small countries, far away from each other. But some trade is going both ways. For instance, we have exported medical cotton to Nepal in large quantities. And we have been buying tea and spices from Nepal. However, the trade amount is not very big. I think the biggest exchange we already have is the trade of services. Currently, there are some businesses that are trading services which are not reflected in the conventional trade balance. Our (Lithuania) economy is small but very innovative and digitalised. My country has gone far in more than 30 years of transformation. When we liberated ourselves from the Soviet Union, we were in shambles. Our economy was down completely, and people were very poor. But now we have graduated into a developed economy. We are considered a high-income country. So I think we've come a very long way. And what I see is Nepal is going a similar way. Nepal started slightly later, and the country is much bigger, with ten times Lithuania’s population. So challenges are, of course, more. And I think education is a big challenge. As we have done this transformation, we continue on digitalisation and on so many modernisation paths. This is the area we can help in advising and guiding because we just did it ourselves and we know how it works. I have been meeting a number of ministers to see which areas the Lithuanian expertise and experience could be best applied in the context of Nepal. So that's a new chapter that I want to open. You met Rekha Sharma, the minister for Communication, Information, and Technology. Can you share what issues were discussed?Since Lithuania ranks sixth in terms of cybersecurity globally, this is one area specifically where our expertise and knowledge could be very applicable, as Nepal has adopted a cybersecurity strategy and guidelines and is embarking on creating the National Cybersecurity Center. We have many companies which work in that area providing services to many others. For instance, the National Cybersecurity Center in Bhutan and the National Institution in Charge of Cybersecurity in Bangladesh were designed by a Lithuanian company. So we think that is what works well in this context. We would be happy to assist Nepal in the cybersecurity area. We could bring a group of experts to advise and guide Nepal. Exports and imports between Nepal and Lithuania have been declining. What should be done to boost bilateral trade between the two small nations for mutual benefit? The trade volumes are up and down and fluctuate year-on-year and this happens with many other countries. During Covid, we exported pharmaceutical agents for vaccines and the trade went up. But later, it declined because there was no need for it. So what we are trying to build now is high-tech cooperation which means the exchange of technology and services. This is one of the sectors which Nepal and Lithuania can exchange in future. We will never measure our relationship in conventional trade as the distance between the two countries is far. Also, nowadays, many producers who used to export have relocated to other regions and are producing in another country, thus changing the export origin, but the product remains Lithuanian. But of course, we need to work and check how our ICT sectors can work together. It's mostly private businesses. But as I said, as a very small but very dynamic government, we also have government-to-government proposals and solutions. So that's why I'm meeting in the ministry and trying to see the needs. We have a super strong laser industry. For decades, we have developed very good laser bays. The screens of an iPhone are cut by using a Lithuanian laser because we supply those laser cutting technologies to iPhone manufacturers—10 percent of the world's scientific lasers are from Lithuania. Our biometrics, which is part of a robotics system, companies have been working around the world and in South Asia helping to verify digital identities like those on voter lists or other registers. In India, the Aadhaar system has a tiny bit of Lithuanian technology used in it. So, we will always have a niche role, but whenever this expertise is needed, then we can really provide it.A small number of tourists visit Nepal from Lithuania. How can Nepal attract tourists from Lithuania?I have visited Nepal as a tourist twice, long ago and I think all of my friends have been to Nepal. We are a very small country and will always be small if you compare it to a much bigger country. Nevertheless, to attract tourists, there is a need to advertise a little more as I think Nepal has excellent things to offer for a reasonable price which is also very important. For now, I can see that almost every Lithuanian can afford a trip to Nepal. The Nepali embassy and travel agencies could also do a little more advertising. I, as a friend of Nepal, am very happy to say and testify to anyone who asks that it's a great country to visit. Be it cultural and religious tourism, mountain trekking, spa, or wellness, I think Nepal has everything. It's easy to reach because connectivity is really good. And it's easy to stay and enjoy as the country is not so super expensive, it's affordable. So what kinds of products are in demand in Nepal and Lithuania? I think from Lithuania it would be electronic devices, digital devices which are needed now in everyday manufacturing processes. For instance, in telematics, any production line with many vehicles or equipment must monitor how they all work. This is where Lithuania is again pioneering. We have 30 percent of India's market in the hardware of telematics. So a Lithuanian company is successfully working in India. It will be IT applications or IT-enabling hardware solutions that we are very good at. From Nepal I think lots of traditional exports could also be interesting as our way of thinking and understanding of fashion and interior is quite similar. For instance, we are a wooden culture. So for us, the idea of a cosy house is wood and textiles, which Nepal produces, which has an excellent market in Lithuania. But in the future, I think, with technologies, ecological farming products will be in demand as the population becomes aware of health and sustainability requirements and not just requirements but use for own consumption. So that's where anything that is ecological and sustainable gets traction, and that's a high-value thing already. It's not a simple potato or tomato, but it's made of ecologically grown products. So how can Nepal and Lithuania work together for mutual benefit? We are here to learn about the changes in Nepal, about the future needs, and about the areas where we are good. We are also here to exchange opinions on issues of global concern, like climate change, which has highly affected both Nepal and Lithuania. None of our countries are great polluters. We, too, are a very minor polluter, much below our obligations, in fact. So how small countries can be together to make sure that the world is really against further global warming is important. Further, I also stress to the Nepal government that we are very grateful for a very principled stance of Nepal vis-a-vis the Russian war against Ukraine. It's a war which is just next door, it's 500 kilometres from my home. Nepal, on a number of occasions, voted in the United Nations to say no to aggression. So I think we are also very grateful and appreciative. Also, we have this unique connection that I wanted to tell, which is a tiny, small, quaint language which was preserved in villages of our country as a very antique, ancient language that is very close to Sanskrit. Since Lithuanian is considered the closest living language, a sister language of Sanskrit. We have started this collaboration with academic institutions here, and Raghunath Adhikari from the Tribhuvan University defended his dissertation on the issue of linguistic similarities last year. And he is the first PhD in Asia to actually do this. So we are happy that we have this connection and he has become a friend of Lithuania. Through him we know about what is happening at the university. Tribhuvan University already has a Memorandum of Understanding with Vilnius University, which is our oldest and main university. So academic collaboration is also very important because there are people working also on technologies, and know-how, which ultimately lead to business cooperation.  \nThe 12th Kantipur Half Marathon, featuring men's/women's half marathon, corporate, college, and wheelchair races with cash prizes and gift hampers, is scheduled for May 18 with an expected participation of over 3,000 runners.\nRishi Amatya's debut novel \"Radha: Wrath of the Maeju,\" featuring a former Royal Kumari battling demonic forces during an earthquake, explores themes of mythology, culture, and the struggles of young writers.\nThe Barbara Foundation on Thursday conferred four journalists with the Barbara Foundation Investigative Journalism Award 2024 for exposing various issues of corruption and abuse of authority through their reportings.Journalists Devendra Bhattarai and Matrika Dahal were awarded the first prize for their in-depth reporting on the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. The revelation led to the arrest of senior leaders, including former ministers Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and Bal Krishna Khand, and high-ranking officials among others for their alleged involvement in the scam.The duo jointly bagged the prize for their investigative journalism and follow-up reporting on the scandal. They received a purse of Rs1.6 million. Bhattarai and Dahal wrote a series of stories on the issue in Kantipur Daily, the Post’s sister paper.Likewise, Deepa Dahal of Ukaalo.com took home the second prize for blowing the cover on the Bansbari Leather and Shoe Factory land scam while Himal Khabar’s Ramesh Kumar came third for his reporting on the irregularities in the stock market and the cooperatives. They took home Rs600,000 and Rs300,000 respectively.The Barabara Foundation established the awards and fellowships to encourage investigative journalism. The facilitation had a prize pool of Rs2.5 million, highest for any journalism award in Nepal, this year.The awards will be handed out every two years, the foundation said. \nDefending champions APF beat Sudurpaschim in the group stage and will play in the finals for a fourth consecutive title.\nHouse of Representatives meeting erupts in scuffle between Nepali Congress and CPN-UML lawmakers over Home Minister Lamichhane's address, forcing adjournment.\nIn a democracy, the three branches of government (executive, legislative, judicial) check and balance each other, but recent questionable verdicts by the judiciary raise concerns of judicial supremacy and potential political instability if not handled responsibly.\nIn June 2020, Nepal’s Parliament ratified a new political map of the country, including geographical territories that were and still remain under the control of India. While some areas in the new map, especially the Kalapani region, were already a subject of dispute between the two countries, the communist government under Khadga Prasad Oli used its two-third parliamentary majority to include areas as far as Limpiyadhura unilaterally. For those who care to look at historical evidence, Nepal had never asserted its claim over Limpiyadhura, which was a territory lost after the Sugauli treaty of 1816. It was only in context to the existing dispute over the origin of the Kali river, which forms an international boundary in the treaty, that Nepal has claimed the Kalapani region and Lipulekh as its territory. India is cognisant of Nepal’s claim, and there is a joint committee looking at these boundary claims, with dialogue also happening at the Foreign Ministry level.Oli’s move in 2020 was not sudden. He had advisors who clearly understood that Nepal did not fulfil the prerequisites for a sovereign claim over most of those territories under the international law, which mandates physical control of the territory with a resident population under active governance. In fact, the only claim that merits a mention, and which Nepal has strongly put across to India, is the credible evidence regarding Nepal governing the villages in the Kalapani region until a few decades back. Specifications of the evidence aside, what is clear is Nepal’s claims in the Kalapani region have been acknowledged by India and well-documented by the joint committee.Oli’s come-back politicsWhen Oli came to power after the 2017 elections, he was riding on the wave of hyper-nationalism he had managed to stoke in the aftermath of the 2015 Indian blockade. While the Madhesh-based parties had indeed initiated the border obstruction to pressure Kathmandu’s political centre into conceding to their demands on the new constitution, the Narendra Modi government that had just come to power in New Delhi was blamed for actively enforcing the blockade. This is a claim India continues to deny. Whatever the truth, the blockade provided an opportune moment for Oli, whose political career was ailing at the time. He not only managed to sideline his bête noire, Madhav Kumar Nepal, inside the party but he also struck a deal with politically insecure Pushpa Kamal Dahal to cobble up a two-thirds majority in the 2017 elections. What happened next has continued to haunt Nepal’s relationship with India. Oli, of all the communist leaders of his generation, best understands that if there is one issue that could mobilise the population across the country, it is our collective sense of insecurity against what we perceive to be India’s over-reach and micro-management of Nepali politics. An average Nepali consumes Indian products, watches Bollywood movies, and supports an IPL team, all the while disdaining what they consider Indian interference in Nepali affairs.To be fair, such a mindset is not uncommon in a relationship between two countries that are disproportionate in geography, demography, economy or military capability. The tendency of the political class to weaponise public sentiments and insecurity against a larger neighbour for domestic electoral politics is not uncommon either. Autocratic and populist regimes across the world have consolidated their hold over power by stoking hate or fear against a perceived enemy state, painting their domestic opposition as weak and incapable of defending national interests. The definition of the enemy state and the national interests, in such cases, are often dictated by those in power to suit their divisive politics.When Oli refused to concede party or government leadership, Pushpa Kamal Dahal wrecked the mighty two-thirds government with the help of the disgruntled Madhav Kumar Nepal faction. Nepali Congress had no issues cashing in on this division, allowing the party’s president, Sher Bahadur Deuba, to become the Prime Minister in July 2021. Upon becoming premier, Deuba and his coalition partner Dahal did all they could to normalise the relationship with New Delhi. There was little talk about the controversial map or the Eminent Persons’ Group (EPG) report, which had both become irritants in the bilateral relationship. After the 2022 elections, when Dahal became prime minister, New Delhi reciprocated by supporting Nepal’s ambitions to invest in large infrastructures and export power in the Indian market and potentially to Bangladesh. In doing so, New Delhi expected to regain some of the trust it had lost after the 2015 blockade. But Oli is a seasoned politician, a political maverick who can see two steps ahead of his competitors. He sensed Dahal’s distrust of his coalition partners, his personal anxieties and insecurity about the future of his party, which he felt was dealt an under-hand during the division of electoral seats. China, which had openly helped in cobbling up the previous left unity, has been more cautious this time. But there is plenty to read between frequent delegations shuttling between Kathmandu and Beijing over the past year. In any case, Oli convinced Dahal to leave the Nepali Congress coalition and continue in power with UML’s support, with a vague promise of a long-term (electoral) partnership. Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajwadi Party and the newly established Rastriya Swatantra Party were offered attractive cabinet positions in exchange for their support as well. Yadav, though, has left the coalition after the split of his party. Perilous brinkmanship If Pushpa Kamal Dahal believes that the UML chairman took all the trouble of bringing down the NC-led coalition just to watch the game from the sidelines, he needs to change his advisors. He may have generously allowed Dahal to continue on the throne, but it is clear who is setting the rules of the game. The recent decision by the current government to include Nepal’s new map in its currency note has Oli’s footprints all over it. However, his brinkmanship with India could have serious ramifications for the country. Not only will such misadventures jeopardise Nepal’s crucial economic interests, especially in the cross-border energy market where the private sector has invested billions of dollars, our ambition to access the trade route to Bangladesh and further east will not see the light of the day.As the war in Ukraine drags on and the conflict in Gaza worsens, Washington is already zooming out from the Indo-Pacific region. This could provide a much-needed conducive environment for a rapprochement between New Delhi and Beijing, something Indian Prime Minister Modi has hinted at recently. Nepali communists must read the changing geopolitical horizon and understand the days of playing one neighbour against the other may not last for long. Nepal is better off drawing complementarities in its relationship with the two neighbours, allowing them to compete for economic interests on its own terms.  \nElectricity as a clean, affordable and eco-friendly energy source is vital in Nepal. This is because indoor air pollution caused by contaminating fuels—used by 50 percent of Nepal’s population—leads to about 24,000 deaths yearly. Using electrical energy instead of inefficient wood and fossil fuels significantly curbs health risks such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory infection (ARI), lung cancer and even death. The second-most used cooking fuel is liquefied petroleum gas, but high foreign currency reserves are being invested in its imports. Switching to e-cooking can be a much-needed boost to expand the current underwhelming domestic electricity consumption and transition towards cleaner and more productive energy use.Last year, the Government of Nepal reported an over 30 percent surge in e-cooktop imports compared to the preceding year. From an economic perspective, a shift towards environment-friendly cooking is a well-timed alternative for reducing trade deficits from LPG gas imports. The foreign currency reserves thus saved could be channelled towards more productive sectors contributing to national development.One essential convener to e-cooking demands can be attributed to the government’s strategies to ensure energy access and equip each household with clean cooking devices by 2030 through national and international goals and commitments. These include the 15th five-year plan, the second Nationally Determined Contribution submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, and the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All). This is to achieve NetZero goals supported by I/NGOs, the private sector, civil society groups and others. But there is still a long way to go. The 15th Five-Year Plan endorsed by the Government of Nepal expected 100 percent of the Nepali population to have access to electricity by 2023-24. In 2021, we reached almost 92 percent, but even today, only 0.5 percent use electricity as a primary cooking fuel. A smooth and uninterrupted electricity supply is key to sustaining this momentum and encouraging a wider uptake of electric stoves nationwide. The urban population, with better purchasing capacities, benefits as early adopters, while for the rural population, affordability is a constraint in addition to irregular supply and unreliable electricity distribution systems. The next group of adopters with the most potential (the early majority) resides in the semi-urban areas that require sensitisation through behavioural change and communication in addition to regular electricity supply and upgraded distribution systems. An innovative market-led approach that sufficiently addresses the awareness, access, affordability and investment issues can accelerate adoption among early and late majority groups. Some considerations need to be taken in the 16th Five-Year Plan. Availability of standard e-cooktops, along with efficient electricity distribution systems, revised e-tariffs, incentives and e-cooking promotional programmes, can help leapfrog towards achieving SDG 7: Universal access to clean and affordable energy with NetZero targets.Currently, distribution systems managed by the National Electricity Authority (NEA) and the Community Rural Electrification Entities (CREEs) do not meet compliance standards, especially in remote areas. A robust makeover of the electricity distribution system is necessary to increase the number of e-cooking adopters and promote sustained use at the household level. Local government, NEA subsidiary, and CREE must work together to support e-cooking adoption at the local level by speeding up the system upgrade provisioned by Community Electrification bylaws.The existing progressive e-tariff is a menace to the sustained use of e-cooking devices: The free minimum consumption for lower-end users/consumers usually demotivates continuous use beyond the free limit of 20 units for rural customers. Reconsideration of e-tariffs that motivate the use of essential gadgets such as e-cooking devices is necessary if we hope to target peripheral consumers. Governments at all levels should consider a holistic approach while designing and implementing electric cooking promotional programmes in close coordination with related stakeholders and vice versa. Therefore, complementing each other’s work and minimising duplication must be prioritised. Authorities should ensure an enabling environment with necessary policies and pragmatic guidelines to support the e-cooking transition—for instance, tax exemption of e-cooking appliances, promotion of local manufacturing of e-cooking devices, etc.The systematic implementation of incentive provisions is essential in promoting a sustainable market for e-cooking. Failing to achieve uniformity and random selection of incentive recipients would only create situations where the real, needful population don’t receive them. Incentives and subsidies must be planned to ensure a participatory market system development of e-cooking products. Need-based incentivisation is essential to ensure the subsidies reach the needy category of the population.Developing and contextualising standards and regulating them for effective implementation can foster confidence in transitioning to e-cooking. This can support the circular economy by importing only standardised products. Moreover, cooking fuel and technology choices depend on accessibility, demographic, and socio-economic factors. Promoting manufacturing within the country can further ensure the cost-effectiveness of the transition. Creating awareness about the cost-effectiveness and safety protocols while using e-cooktops, ensuring after-sales services, and swiftly responding to related queries are necessary interventions to propagate e-cooking adopters and ensure sustained use. This is most effective when the target community participates in the process. While the majority of the population in the country is still dependent on traditional inefficient biomass, switching to cleaner fuels like electricity can form a basis for attaining sustainable development. The conducive environments created by our commitments through SDG7 and our country-specific report NDC II to UNFCCC in attaining NetZero goals have been instrumental so far. Now, we need to strengthen our two major enablers- the adequate and reliable electricity supply and well-functioning e-cooking appliance supply systems to pave the path towards transition to e-cooking in Nepal.  \nAfter a months-long heatwave, the recent rainfall in Nepal brought much-needed relief and helped put out wildfires. Unfortunately, the rainwater, coupled with warmth, also created a favourable environment for dengue-carrying mosquitoes. As a result, dengue cases are already on the rise, with 57 districts reporting dengue infection, and over 50 cases were reported in a single week. Experts believe the worst is yet to come. Even though dengue has taken many lives in the past few years (20 deaths in 2023, 88 in 2022 and six in 2019) and infected many (52,000 in 2023, 54,000 in 2022 and 16,000 in 2019), it remains the most neglected virus. Authorities seem to care little either about its spread or severity. Nor do they try to understand the changing nature of the virus from climate change and rising temperatures through research and tests. A Dengue Action Plan is in place, but the government hasn’t been able to do enough to contain the spread of the virus except relying on traditional methods like surveillance of the virus, serotyping of the dengue-carrying mosquitoes, plus treatment, management and collaboration with local levels. Even the action plan acknowledges that the country’s dengue spread has gone out of hand, making it difficult to contain. Nepal is unable to undertake year-round surveillance and prevention programmes due to budgetary limits. The action plan clearly states that there’s no budget to deal with dengue throughout the year. This was bound to happen as the health ministry’s budget was reduced this fiscal year, discontinuing many programmes. Moreover, even the budget allocated for a particular fiscal year (for example in 2022-23) is used up before March/April, when cases usually surge. These months, as experts suggest, are crucial, as stopping the spread of the virus just when the cases are rising is the most effective way to cut down on the number of deaths and infections throughout the year. Apart from insufficient budget, the country also lacks entomologists, and no other ministry is held responsible for the work except health.The situation will only worsen the longer these challenges are overlooked. And removing the dengue menace should not be the sole responsibility of the health ministry. The finance ministry should allocate enough budget to drive dengue prevention measures for a whole year; the environment ministry can implement environmental policies to control the breeding sites of mosquitoes, and urge people to maintain sanitation and proper waste management; the urban development ministry must manage drainage systems and green spaces; while the transportation ministry needs to prevent the accumulation of stagnant water on roads. Only such a collective measure will help reduce dengue dangers.While continuing with awareness programmes, door-to-door campaigns and search-find-destroy drives should also be pushed on a regular basis. There is a strong case for learning from other countries. For instance, eDengue systems implemented in Malaysia could be used to report cases from rural parts of Nepal and detect severe cases for timely medical intervention. The onus is also on the public to take preventive measures on a year-round basis. Again, dengue is not something that only the government can control. If we don’t work together, many of us will needlessly suffer.  \nIndia captain Sunil Chhetri, the country’s most prolific footballer, will retire from international football after the World Cup qualifier against Kuwait on June 6, the 39-year-old announced on Thursday.Chhetri has been the face of Indian football for nearly a decade-and-half and his 94 international goals make him the third-highest active international goalscorer after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.“It was not that I was feeling tired,” Chhetri said in a video he posted on social media.“When the instinct came this should be my last game, I thought about it a lot and eventually I came to this decision.”“Will I be sad after this? Of course...the kid inside me never wants to stop if given a chance to play for his country.”“It’s time for our country to see the next number nine.”Chhetri is also India’s most-capped player having played 150 international matches since his debut against Pakistan in 2005.“Your legacy on and off-the-field will always be remembered,” the All India Football Federation (AIFF) said in a post on X.“Thank you @chetrisunil11 for your leadership, dedication and commitment to Indian football.” \nBritain’s food watchdog has applied extra control measures on all spice imports from India, it said on Wednesday, becoming the first to ramp up scrutiny of all Indian spices after contamination allegations against two brands sparked concerns among global food regulators.Hong Kong last month suspended sales of three spice blends produced by MDH and one by Everest, saying they contained high levels of a cancer-causing pesticide ethylene oxide.Singapore also ordered a recall of the Everest mix, and New Zealand, the United States, India and Australia have since said they are looking into issues related to the two brands.MDH and Everest—two of India’s most popular brands—have said their products are safe for consumption.In the most stringent crackdown so far impacting all Indian spices, the UK’s Food Standards Agency (FSA) said that in light of the concerns it has “applied extra control measures for pesticide residues in spices from India which includes ethylene oxide”.The agency did not elaborate on the exact steps it is taking.“The use of ethylene oxide is not allowed here and maximum residue levels are in place for herbs and spices,” James Cooper, Deputy Director of Food Policy at the FSA, said in a statement to Reuters.India’s Spices Board, which regulates exports, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. India is the biggest exporter, consumer and producer of spices in the world.In 2022 Britain imported $128 million worth of spices, with India accounting for almost $23 million, data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity website shows.MDH and Everest export their products to many regions including the US, Europe, South East Asia, Middle East and Australia.Indian regulators have also conducted testing of all spice products and inspected samples of MDH and Everest products, though no results have been made public so far.MDH has since 2021 seen an average 14.5 percent of its US shipments rejected over the presence of bacteria salmonella, a Reuters analysis of US FDA data has found.On Wednesday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency told Reuters in a statement it was aware of the concerns around MDH and Everest’s products and “continues to monitor the situation”.“Based on current information, we have no evidence to suggest that the issues raised affect products currently in the Canadian market,” it said. \nAn AI video shows an ecstatic Narendra Modi sporting a trendy jacket and trousers, grooving on a stage to a Bollywood song as the crowd cheers. The Indian prime minister reshared the video on X, saying “such creativity in peak poll season is truly a delight.”Another video, with the same stage setting, shows Modi’s rival Mamata Banerjee dancing in a saree-like outfit, but the background score is parts of her speech criticizing those who quit her party to join Modi’s. State police have launched an investigation saying the video can “affect law and order.”The different reactions to videos created using artificial intelligence (AI) tools underscore how the use and abuse of the technology is increasing and creating worries for regulators and security officials as the world's most populous nation holds a mammoth general election.Easy to make AI videos, which contain near-perfect shadow and hand movements, can at times mislead even digitally-literate people. But risks are higher in a country where many of the 1.4 billion people are tech challenged and where manipulated content can easily stir sectarian tensions, especially at election time.According to a World Economic Forum survey published in January, the risk to India from misinformation is seen higher than the risk from infectious diseases or illicit economic activity in the next two years.“India is already at a great risk of misinformation - with AI in picture, it can spread at the speed of 100X,” said New Delhi-based consultant Sagar Vishnoi, who is advising some political parties on AI use in India's election.“Elderly people, often not a tech savvy group, increasingly fall for fake narratives aided by AI videos. This could have serious consequences like triggering hatred against a community, caste or religion.”The 2024 national election – being held over six weeks and ending on June 1 – is the first in which AI is being deployed. Initial examples were innocent, restricted to some politicians using the technology to create videos and audio to personalize their campaigns.India’s Election Commission last week warned political parties against AI use to spread misinformation and shared seven provisions of information technology and other laws that attract jail terms of up to three years for offences including forgery, promoting rumours and enmity.A senior national security official in New Delhi said authorities are concerned about the possibility of fake news leading to unrest. The easy availability of AI tools makes it possible to manufacture such fake news, especially during elections, and it's difficult to counter, the official said.“We don’t have an (adequate monitoring) capacity...the ever evolving AI environment is difficult to keep track of,” said the official.A senior election official said: “We aren’t able to fully monitor social media, forget about controlling content.”They declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to media.AI and deepfakes are being increasingly used in elections elsewhere in the world, including in US, Pakistan and Indonesia. The latest spread of the videos in India shows the challenges faced by authorities.For years, an Indian IT ministry panel has been in place to order blocking of content that it feels can harm public order, at its own discretion or on receiving complaints. While Mod’s reaction to his AI dancing video - “I also enjoyed seeing myself dance” - was light hearted, the Kolkata city police in West Bengal state launched an investigation against X user, SoldierSaffron7, for sharing the Banerjee video.Kolkata cyber crime officer, Dulal Saha Roy, shared a typed notice on X asking the user to delete the video or “be liable for strict penal action.”“I am not deleting that, no matter what happens,” the user told Reuters via X direct messaging, declining to share their number or real name as they feared police action. “They can’t trace (me).”Election officers told Reuters authorities can only tell social media platforms to remove content and are left scrambling if the platforms say the posts don't violate their internal policies.The Modi and Banerjee dancing videos, with 30 million and 1.1 million views respectively on X, were created using a free website, Viggle. The site allows a photograph and a few basic prompts that are detailed in a tutorial to generate videos within minutes that show the person in the photograph dancing or making other real-life moves.Viggle co-founder Hang Chu and Banerjee’s office did not respond to Reuters queries.Other than the two dancing AI videos, one other 25-second Viggle video spreading online shows Banerjee appear in front of a burning hospital and blowing it up using a remote. It's an AI altered clip of a scene from the 2008 movie, The Dark Knight, that shows Batman's foe, Joker, wreaking havoc.The video post has 420,000 views.The West Bengal police believes it violates Indian IT laws, but X has not taken any action as it “strongly believes in defending and respecting the voice of our users”, according to an email notice sent by X to the user, which Reuters reviewed.“They can’t do anything to me. I didn't take that (notice) seriously,” the user told Reuters via X direct messaging. \nElectoral reform is the latest flashpoint in a decades-long tussle over France’s role in the mineral-rich island, which lies in the southwest Pacific, some 1,500 km (930 miles) east of Australia.New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters called for all sides to de-escalate a situation that was “of serious concern across the Pacific Islands region”.Vanuatu’s prime minister, Charlot Salwai, chairman of the Melanesian Spearhead Group, which also includes Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, said the indiscriminate destruction of property would affect New Caledonia’s economy in a big way and have a cascading effect on the lives of all New Caledonians, including Kanaks.France should establish dialogue with FLNKS, which has condemned the violence, and annul the constitutional reform that sparked the crisis, he said.“These events could have been avoided if the French government had listened,” he added.Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong in parliament called for calm and said Australia supported discussions between all parties.More than 200 people have been arrested, and 64 gendarmes and police injured, while road barricades put up by the protesters were causing a “dire situation” for medicine and food for the population, Le Franc said in a televised news conference.Main and secondary roads in Noumea were blocked by barricades with burning cars and car carcasses, some with booby traps, he said.“I am calling on those at the head of the CCAT to stop these actions, which are murderous, deadly actions that can leave families in mourning,” he said of the traps.There were also confrontations overnight between CCAT members and self-defence groups who are also in breach of the curfew and a weapons ban, he said.Noumea resident Yoan Fleurot told Reuters in a video interview that he has seen looting and destruction of property. Some storeowners willingly let their shelves be raided, pleading that their shops not be destroyed, he said.Fleurot said he is armed with a firearm and has video surveillance installed around his house, adding he has only ventured out in daylight to check on his parents or his properties.“Caledonia will have a hard time recovering from this crisis... Everything, 80%, is destroyed,” he added. \nShreeya Giri, 28, has been named to Forbes’ 30 Under 30 List, which includes 300 young entrepreneurs, leaders, and trailblazers from across the Asia-Pacific region.Giri, who is the founder of Nepali digital mental health platform Happy Minds, was listed by the prestigious magazine under the social impact category.Happy Minds, Giri’s brainchild, is a Nepali digital mental health platform that offers individual online and face-to-face counselling, as well as group workshops. The platform’s innovative approach and impact were recognised when it was named the best newcomer from Nepal at the 2022 South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Startup Awards.Forbes on Thursday announced the ninth edition of its ‘30 Under 30 Asia’ list. They were listed under ten categories— the arts (art and style, food and drink); entertainment and sports; finance and venture capital; media, marketing and advertising; retail and e-commerce; enterprise technology; industry, manufacturing and energy; healthcare and science; social impact and consumer technology.Other notable persons from Asia featured in the 2024 list include the K-pop girl band Ive, Singaporean track and field athlete Veronica Shanti Pereira, Japan’s youngest mayor, Ryosuke Takashima of Ashiya City, and many others.Forbes said the 2024 list features a diverse set of 30 Under 30 listees, with 21 countries and territories represented across the Asia-Pacific region. India had the most with 86 entries, followed by China and Japan (32 each), Singapore (27), Australia (26) and Indonesia (18). \nFormer Nepal Army chief Dharmapaal Barsingh Thapa died on Thursday morning.Thapa was admitted to the Chhauni-based Nepal Army Hospital two days ago following health complications, where he died while undergoing treatment, according to the Nepal Army.Thapa was the chief of Army Staff from 1995 to 1999. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nPolitical engagement of Nepali teachers and students has become a highly debated subject recently. Ironically, people who run political parties and governments in a multiparty system have raised this topic on different occasions. Lately, the well-meaning, young and intelligent Education Minister Sumana Shrestha has cast ripples by proposing to strictly bar teachers from directly engaging in political activities and holding their jobs at educational institutions simultaneously. Political leaders and government ministers have put forward ambivalent proposals to keep academic institutions and pedagogy free from party activism. Educational institutions became highly politicised after the fall of the Panchayat. But to borrow from the English poet TS Eliot’s poem “Gerontion”, Nepali history has many “passages, contrived corridors”. The political engagements of the students during the Panchayat regime influenced the activities of teachers’ unions. Teachers’ allegiances to political parties and proactive engagements have begun to be treated as an important public sphere. The public sphere of education became the bastion of such political activities. Some discussion about that is in order.The parties banned from openly working during the Panchayat era found the students and their organisations the most effective sources of spreading their ideas in society. The students had all the necessary accoutrements for running an organisation like holding free elections by upholding free multiparty ideas. The students’ unions were shaped in a multiparty pattern. The political leaders that held sway during that period found these unions the most useful tools for spreading their ideas. The students had unions, free forums, occasional seminars and multiparty contestations. They were broadly divided between what became familiar as binary in Nepali politics, the Nepali Congress and the Nepal Communist Party. Apart from a few organisations that followed the binary espoused by the students, the teachers had weak functioning, open party-oriented organisations. The teachers engaged in creating unions in the multiparty order towards the last days of the Panchayat rule.The political parties realised that the best forums to promote or propagate multiparty ideas were those of the students and, in some cases, the teachers’ unions. That practice was hegemonised after the fall of the Panchayat. It became so accepted a norm of the hegemony, as defined by the Italian thinker Antonio Gramsci, that nobody questioned the effectiveness and validity of the political organisations of students and teachers; they became a subject of acceptance. They worked hand in glove with these organisations. Parties even used them as hugely useful propaganda machinery. This hegemony almost wrecked educational institutions when politically proactive teachers openly worked for the political parties. The students, too, started working openly for the parties. After 1996, the practice continued under a different condition. The students who followed the Maoist party line became militant, and several went underground. Some teachers were sympathetic to the Maoists and worked for them. Such is the genesis of the influence of politics in educational institutions in Nepal. My experience says it is important to look at the students' political inclinations by placing them in a historical order. I want to put forth some visceral narratives.Recalling my student days today as a professor emeritus is revealing for two reasons. One, the debate about the political activism of teachers and students has occupied the minds of politicians and educationists today. Two, this debate has a long history and legacy. It started when King Mahendra dissolved the people's elected parliament in 1960 and introduced the Panchayat system.It was in the early days of the Panchayat that I joined colleges. First, I enrolled in the Intermediate of Arts at Morang College, Biratnagar, after the School Leaving Certificate. At that time, students found it convenient to form unions along party lines. As a college student, my problem, like those of my contemporaries, was to work with a double consciousness that involved balancing my studies with my political activism, which was not an easy task but an exciting experience. When I joined the Bachelor of Arts at Mahendra College of Dharan, I became politically active and got elected as general secretary of the left-oriented student union. Out of the union, we created a small cohort of Trotskyites involving little over a dozen of us. We even fled to India, crossing the thick charkose forest on foot, and got badly beaten up and detained after we returned. However, even in those circumstances, I continued my studies and did well in the final examination. But I maintained what I would like to call the double bind the whole time. Importantly, during our political activism, we did not meet any political leaders. I was influenced by the writings of BP Koirala, Pushpalal Shrestha and Manmohan Adhikari, but I met none of them. That was the pattern of student political activism. It is entirely wrong to say that students who espoused multiparty ideas always followed the instructions of political leaders. When I came to Kathmandu to study the Master of Arts in English, I realised that my double bind entered a new phase. I came to the capital with a blank mind after my political leanings were gone. The strange visitors mostly from the West who came to Kathmandu began to fill the blank of my mind. They were known as hippies. That is a different story. I also became the culture secretary at Kirtipur Union. Today, when we are talking about keeping the institutions free from political activism, we should treat students' aspirations in politics as something different from those of the teachers. I support the minister's efforts to keep educational institutions from becoming the bastions of political parties. I acknowledge that the students and some of their unions have been playing as tools of the political parties and have crossed the limits of the educational norms once in a while. Students whom I have known as colleagues and as teachers for over half a century have a great history of fighting for freedom and academic accomplishments. Students should keep up that great tradition. Teachers, the custodians of education, should stop becoming the cadres of political parties. The political parties and organisations will do great harm to education if they continue to work with the old temptation of using students and teachers for their politics. We are acting at a time when the double binds of students and teachers need to be prudently and creatively used.     \nClimate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, according to the latest survey report.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, was released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics. It paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say worse is yet to come.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades. Major economic sectors and essential services like health and education in Nepal have felt the repercussions of extreme weather events linked to climate change, the survey said.The statistics office said the sampling used the total number of households from the population census. In total, 6.66 million individual households were included in the frame. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from July to March 2023 among 6,508 households in 326 primary sampling units, encompassing all seven provinces. The statistics office said all the respondents were at least 45 years old and had lived in the survey area for 25 years, forming the sampling frame that included households meeting these criteria across Nepal.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Nepal’s agriculture sector is the mainstay of the country’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of the population. The sector is mainly rainfed and heavily dependent on rainfall.When the rain fails to fall, the GDP takes a tumble. This dependence makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain region (68.7 percent), hill region (50.3 percent), and Tarai region (46.3 percent) also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases. The survey report shows households in altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 metres reported emergingnew crop diseases (60.2 percent) over the last 25 years. This shows diverse factors influence the prevalence of crop diseases across diverse geographical and climatic domains.“The situation is alarming,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office.“The survey was intended to see people’s perception towards climate change, the most burning issue globally,” he said. Climate change literacy among people, mostly in rural areas, is shallow, but some exciting facts exist. “Most of the farmers surveyed are not clear whether climate change is bringing diseases and low yields, but at the same time, they have a coping mechanism knowingly or unknowingly,” said Regmi. For instance, farmers have changed the cropping pattern. “If they think rainfall will be below normal or drought, they switch to another crop.”The survey shows that 35.8 percent of the households surveyed were aware of climate change. Across all three geographical domains, the number of households unaware of climate change is significantly high, with the highest number being in the mountain region (70.9 percent). The sex-disaggregated data indicate that most male (61.3 precent) and female (74 percent) respondents were unaware of climate change impacts.The accessibility of early warning information among the people is weak.In urban municipalities, 16.3 percent of households received early-warning information, while 83.7 percent of the respondents did not receive any information regarding a disaster occurring shortly. Altitude-wise, households in low-altitude regions have received more early-warning information than those in the higher-altitude areas. The survey results show a significant impact of climate change on Nepal's water resources over the last 25 years. Climate change has notable implications for the country's energy transition, as it is actively pursuing a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources. According to experts, the survey report is eye-opening. Nepal plans to generate 30,000MW of electricity by 2035, and the market for Nepal's hydropower is opening up in India and Bangladesh.Many households reported adverse changes and noted their water resources dried up. This phenomenon was observed across all domains and indicates a nationwide decrease in water availability. Respondents experienced a reduction in ground and surface water, primarily attributed to insufficient rainfall and increased drought incidents. According to the survey, 78.3 percent of households observed a decline in rivulets and streams, and 55 percent observed a decrease in wells, springs, and stone spouts. Likewise, 47.7 percent observed changes in water resources due to insufficient rainfall, followed by an increase in drought (20.3 percent), road construction (3.4 percent), deforestation and urbanisation (3.2 percent). In contrast, minimal respondents observed change due to population growth, earthquakes and landslides/soil erosion over the last 25 years.The survey said that over the past 25 years, Nepal has suffered from various natural disasters. Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.  \nThe victory of Suhang Nembang, a political neophyte representing the CPN-UML, in Ilam-2 by-election may not have a big impact on the make-up of the federal parliament. But it nevertheless hints at the country’s general political landscape and, of course, of the Koshi Province, where identity politics had been all the rage in the lead-up to the election.The nomenclature of Koshi Province, of which Ilam is a district, had been a flashpoint of violent agitation led by the proponents of identity politics who wanted a name that reflected the ethnic identity of the place. Two activists from that front—Milan Limbu, representing the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and independent Dakendra Singh Limbu, who was part of the Province-1 Renaming Joint Struggle Committee—were in the fray. So there was curiosity on how they would perform. While the latter came in third with 11,457 votes, the former’s electoral run ended rather dismally as he could not even protect his security deposit.The votes gained by Dakendra has undercut the claims of the major parties that voices for identity-based politics in the region were weakening, argues Govinda Chhantyal, who is among the activists who opposed the nomenclature of Koshi Province.“The number of votes independent candidate Dekendra Singh Limbu garnered in Ilam-2 bypoll has established identity-politics as a major agenda in the region,” Chhantyal told the Post. “Since the 2014 election, the agenda of identity politics has been subjugated. This by-election, however, has once again established it as a political agenda.”The election result has also given the emergent Rastriya Swatantra Party a reality check, experts say. The RSP has a long way to go if it is to establish itself as a major political force throughout the country, they say, as candidates of both the ‘traditional’ political parties, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, trumped all others.The Ilam-2 House of Representatives seat went vacant after former Speaker and vice-chair of UML Subas Chandra Nembang died of a heart attack in September last year.While Suhang, the late leader’s son, won the bypoll securing 27,772 votes, his closest competitor, Dambar Bahadur Khadka, of the Nepali Congress, obtained 21,942 against Dakendra Singh’s 11,457 and Milan Limbu’s 5,050.The result shows the old parties are very much in the fray.“It seems people still see the old parties as relevant given their robust networks at the grassroots, which RSP and independent candidates lacked,” Chiran Manandhar, who was one the observers of Ilam-2 election representing the Democracy Research Center Nepal, told the Post. “People who aspire to political patronage still find old parties relevant.”The RSP had created great buzz with their vigorous campaigning for the Ilam-2 seat. Their candidate Milan Limbu and the independent Dakendra Singh had challenged the traditional parties. Given the past votes obtained by the RSP in the 2022 election and the by-elections in Chitwan-2 and Tanahun-1 a year earlier, the party was expected to challenge the established forces this time, too. But that was not to be.After the poll results, RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane took to social media to thank all the voters and urged his party supporters to accept the outcome. “Thank you everyone who voted for us and also gave us a big message,” he said.Other RSP leaders have said that there were some shortcomings of the party while contesting the Ilam-2 seat, which they would review in the upcoming central committee meeting of the party.“We heeded the signal bell, albeit belatedly,” reads the statement released by party general secretary Mukul Dhakal after the results.The RSP, which emerged as the national political force in the November 2022 election, still has a long way to go before it becomes a major political party that can go toe to toe against the likes of the Congress and the UML, experts say. “It seems the RSP has some currency in the urban areas of the country, but when it comes to the countryside, they still need to work hard to establish a base,” Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political scientist, told the Post.For Bhatta, party president Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the cooperative scam is another reason why RSP could not perform well in Ilam-2.Lamichhane, who is also the deputy prime minister and minister of home affairs, has been accused in the cooperative fund embezzlement cases lodged in Kaski District Court and Rupandehi District Court. Lamichhane has been denying his involvement. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel delivered the government's policies and programmes on Tuesday after the Nepali Congress lifted the obstruction in the House of Representatives. However, the disruption continued afterwards.President Paudel read out the policies and programmes of the government in the joint sitting of the federal parliament.The Congress then blocked the proceedings of both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly and did not let the assembly table a motion of expressing gratitude to the President for delivering the government’s annual paper.It is customary for Parliament to thank the President for reading out the annual policies and programmes. The parliamentary party meeting of the Congress on Tuesday morning, however, had decided not to allow Parliament to proceed after the head of state wraps up his presentation.The Congress later responded that the policies and programmes fail to address the problems of cooperatives’ victims. The main opposition has been protesting in Parliament, demanding a parliamentary probe into the issue of cooperatives around the country embezzling the deposits of hundreds of thousands of depositors. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane is the focus of the largest party’s fury for his alleged involvement in the cooperative scam. “Our position that the government has protected the people who have swindled cooperatives victims has been reconfirmed,” said Ramesh Lekhak, the chief whip of the Congress party, while talking to the media after the policies and programmes had been read out.The main opposition party was initially not ready to allow the smooth operation of the Parliament’s proceedings. The party even warned the government and the ruling partners that it would prevent President Paudel from presenting the government's policies and programmes should its demand go unheeded.The Congress has been disrupting Parliament, demanding a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane over allegations of cooperative funds embezzlement. Lamichhane has publicly refuted the charges and asked for a chance to make his case clear in Parliament.But the Congress has been preventing Lamichhane from speaking in the House. The Congress, which appeared tough against the resumption of parliamentary business, even the presidential appearance, had relented and agreed to let the President present the programmes. But it resorted to the obstruction soon after. In 2017, the CPN-UML, while in the opposition, had been obstructing parliamentary proceedings. It allowed then-President Bidya Devi Bhandari to present the annual policies. The opposition then protested the Cabinet’s decision to increase the number of local federal units in the Tarai in the midst of the elections. The party later obstructed the motion of thanks to the President.During Speaker Devraj Ghimire’s meeting with the party chief whips on Tuesday afternoon, before the President read out the government’s annual document, the Congress had announced its plan to continue to disrupt the House after the policies had been presented.“We will continue to interrupt the House until our demand is addressed,” Congress whip Sushila Thing told the Post. “As there is no parliamentary practice of barring the head of state to present policies and programmes, we too didn’t go that uncharted route.”The party will not allow other proceedings of the two houses for as long as it takes in order to get its demands addressed, Thing said.On Tuesday morning, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa and the party’s Chief Whip Lekhak met Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to discuss the issue of parliamentary obstruction. Dahal had requested the Congress leaders to allow a smooth functioning of the legislature. The Congress leaders also claimed that the prime minister seemed positive about addressing their demand.“While meeting our leaders, the prime minister seemed positive but he has not taken the necessary steps to honour the call of the main opposition,” Congress whip Thing said. Dahal’s openness to the formation of the probe committee was one of the reasons the Congress became ready to allow the President to present the policies and programmes. Shakti Basnet, the minister of energy, water resources and irrigation, claimed that the discussion between the government and Congress was headed in a positive direction.“Until late Monday night, the Congress was adamant on barring the President from presenting the policies and programmes. But on Tuesday, we reached an agreement to allow the President to do so,” Basnet, a Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, told the Post. “The government will similarly reach an agreement with the Congress on its demand for the probe committee.”According to the Congress leaders, Sunday's meeting between the prime minister and Congress leaders also concluded positively to address the party's demand. After the Congress leaders met Prime Minister Dahal, the party held the parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday morning. The same meeting allowed President Paudel to confer the government's annual policies and programmes. The ruling parties and the main opposition have been discussing smooth operation of Parliament for the past few days. However, given the inflexible positions of both sides, Tuesday’s session was expected to face trouble.“The ruling parties and the opposition need to come to a logical conclusion to open the parliamentary business,” UML whip Sunita Baral told the Post. “It looks like both sides only have discussed the issue at their ease. What we need is negotiation to resolve the issues of both Parliament and the cooperative scam.”The constitution mandates the government to present its annual budget on Jestha 15 (May 28 this year). For this reason also, the ruling and opposition parties need to close their ranks, Baral added.The ruling parties are ready to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the issues plaguing the cooperative sector. However, they are reluctant to constitute a committee with the mandate to probe Lamichhane. The Congress, too, is positive about a broad inquiry into the cooperatives, but it deems investigating Lamichhane in particular a necessity after various probes by police and other government bodies established his involvement in the scams. The Congress had disrupted the winter session of Parliament before it was prorogued on April 14, with the same demand. The party has also been obstructing the new session of Parliament that commenced on May 10. \nNepal’s regional political parties that emerged as prominent forces mainly after the political change of popular movement of 2006 have entered into a stage of disputes and divisions.On May 5, Ashok Rai, one of the top leaders of Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), along with some other key leaders, split the party and registered an application for a new party at the Election Commission. The election body registered the Janata Samajbadi Party under Rai’s leadership. Seven of the 12 federal lawmakers of the Yadav-led JSP-Nepal joined the Rai-led party.Yadav on Monday moved the Supreme Court challenging the Election Commission’s decision to register the new party, accusing the body of giving recognition to the Rai-led group as a new political party unconstitutionally. The case is sub-judice in the court.Yadav, who was deputy prime minister and minister for health and population in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government, resigned from his post on Monday. His party pulled out of the government.Later in the evening, Dahal appointed one minister and one minister of state from the newly formed party led by Rai.“With the resignation of our party’s ministers, our party has withdrawn its support to the government,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The JSP-Nepal’s parliamentary party leader Upendra Yadav, writing a letter to Speaker Devraj Ghimire, withdrew the party’s support to the government.On the other hand, the JSP-Nepal, which had been leading the Madhesh government since 2017, has been limited to a minority position after the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support to the provincial government. Yadav’s JSP-Nepal is the only party to get the opportunity to lead a provincial government continuously for seven years. With the UML and Maoist Centre withdrawing their support, it is almost certain to be out of power in the province for the first time in seven years.It is not only the JSP-Nepal that has split. In February, Rajendra Mahato, a key leader of the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), quit the organisation to announce his new campaign, Rastriya Mukti Andolan, literally the ‘National Liberation Movement.’Bijay Kumar Gachchhadar, who led the Madheshi Janaadhikar Forum-Democratic, merged his party with Nepali Congress. Once a powerful leader in national politics, Gachchhadar has now lost his influence in Madhesh as well.Hridayesh Tripathi, a prominent Madheshi leader, formed a separate outfit, the Janata Pragatisheel Party, over two years ago.A senior Maoist leader, Prabhu Sah from the Madhesh, also formed his own Aam Janata Party in December 2022.It is not only the traditional forces but also the emerging ones that are grappling with crises.The Nagarik Unmukti Party (NUP), which emerged mainly from the latest general election, has been embroiled in a factional dispute between party chair Ranjita Shrestha and her husband, Resham Lal Chaudhary. The rift caused the party to lose the opportunity to lead the Sudurpaschim provincial government last month.While Shrestha has joined hands with the Dahal-led ruling coalition, Chaudhary is lobbying to collaborate with Nepali Congress.The regional political forces, which had emerged as a serious challenge for mainstream political forces such as Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, have lost their influence drastically in the recent years, mainly due to intra-party feuds and divisions.“They try to agitate for their rights, but they also indulge in a politics of power, which contrasts with each other,” Tula Narayan Shah, a Madhesh-based political analyst, told the Post. “Probably one of their demands can be mustered through the protest, but the other can only be achieved from the House of Representatives.”Experts think that despite their shortcomings, regional parties’ relevance is still intact. “If the traditional regional parties could not prove their significance, they will be replaced by the new ones,” Lokraj Baral, a political analyst, told the Post. “However, the relevance of regional parties will remain intact.”He said that with the influence of Yadav diminishing in the province, CK Raut of Janamat Party is likely to take his position in the days to come if the latter can prove his credibility.Experts say that regional parties, rather than being driven to address the regional issues for which they were constituted, got diverted from their initial motives and became self-centered, culminating in splits.“When marginalised people constitute the party, those parties are often leader-centric,” Shah told the Post. “Parties where a single leader holds sway are less accommodative and more autocratic. Internal democracy is weak in those parties. As a result, they split.” \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal)’s division is expected to lead the Madhesh provincial government into a crisis. The CPN (Maoist Centre), Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s party that has backed the Madhesh government, was in an internal meeting on Thursday to discuss the prospect of the provincial government, which is led by the JSP-Nepal chaired by Upendra Yadav.On Sunday, Ashok Rai, the federal council chair of the Yadav-led JSP-Nepal, along with six other lawmakers and 30 central committee members, split the party to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. The Election Commission on Monday registered the Rai-led new party.At least two Madhesh assembly leaders of the Maoist Centre the Post spoke to said they are considering forming a new government in the province. “As we are still discussing a change in the provincial government, it would be premature to share the details,” a Maoist Centre provincial lawmaker told the Post on condition of anonymity. “We are taking up the issue with various parties in the provincial assembly.”“With the budget session of the provincial assembly fast approaching, we want to conclude the discussion on the new government before that,” the Maoist Centre provincial assembly member said. The Maoist Centre holds two ministries in the Madhesh government led by Saroj Yadav. Bharat Sah, the parliamentary party leader of the Maoist Centre who took charge of the Ministry of Forests, has not been working, accusing the chief minister of not allowing him to lead the finance ministry as promised at the time of a Cabinet reshuffle on April 16.The Maoist Centre had claimed the government’s leadership in Madhesh after Prime Minister Dahal changed coalition partners at the centre on March 4. But Saroj Kumar Yadav was reappointed the chief minister based on the broad power-sharing deal reached at the centre.On April 16 Saroj Yadav sought a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly for the fourth time after the formation of the provincial government in January last year. In the latest floor test, Yadav secured 61 votes in his favour in the 107-member assembly. Voting for Yadav were provincial assembly members of the Janata Samajbadi Party (19), the CPN-UML (25 including the Speaker who cannot vote), the Maoist Centre (9), the CPN (Unified Socialist) (7) and independent lawmakers. The Nepali Congress (22), the Janamat Party (13) and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (9) sit in the opposition.After Sunday’s party split at the centre, the Upendra Yadav-led faction of the Janata Samajbadi held the provincial parliamentary party meeting on Monday. Of the party’s 19 assembly members, three didn’t attend the meeting, a party leader had told the Post. Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal central spokesperson Manish Suman, who attended the provincial meeting, said, “The split at the central level does not reflect in the provincial meeting as all members except three were present.”Political analysts believe the coalition partners may not accept the Upendra Yadav-led party’s leadership in the provincial government, even though the split at the centre has little bearing on the JSP-Nepal in the province.As the largest party in the provincial assembly, the UML is unlikely to support the leader of the JSP-Nepal, the third-largest party in Janakpur, as chief minister. UML leaders have bitter relations with Madheshi politicians, mainly since 2015, the year the constitution was promulgated. As UML chair KP Sharma Oli was projected as anti-federalist and anti-Madhesh in the province, the UML leaders were even chased away from some districts and barred from holding mass gatherings there.However, in the 2022 elections, the UML emerged as the largest party in the same province.“The Madhesh government is unlikely to keep its current shape,” Chandra Kishore, a Madhesh-based political expert, told the Post. “The resentment against the incumbent government was growing for its poor performance. It would have fallen sooner or later, even if the JSP-Nepal had not split.”He said the UML aspires to lead the provincial government. “The largest party in the assembly may stake its claim to the government leadership this time,” he added.However, Rajendra Prasad Chaudhary Tharu, an assembly member from the UML, argued that the JSP-Nepal of Upendra Yadav is still strong in the province. Though the party has been vertically split at the centre, the splinter group doesn’t have the numbers to change the government in the province, the UML leader said. “However, the provincial power equation will be largely determined by the central coalition,” UML assembly member Tharu told the Post. “A change in the Madhesh government is possible only if the Upendra Yadav-led JSP-Nepal breaks ties with the current coalition.”JSP-Nepal leader Anirudra Prasad Singh echoes UML leader Tharu. “The fate of the Madhesh provincial government will largely depend on the decision of the ruling coalition in Kathmandu,” Singh told the Post. Singh added, “But if the central coalition’s decision goes against us, we might have to step down from the Madhesh government leadership.”Notably, JSP-Nepal has continuously led the Madhesh government since the first provincial election held in 2017. In fact, the Upendra Yadav-led JSP-Nepal is the only party to continuously lead a provincial government for the past seven years. Other parties are thus considering a change this time around, said a Maoist Centre provincial assembly member. \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal has announced to knock the judiciary's door against the Election Commission's decision to recognise its spliter group as a new political party.The party led by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health and Population Upendra Yadav has concluded that the registration of Janata Samajbadi Party chaired by Ashok Rai is illegal.\"The new party was registered overnight even without the law to do so. Never in history has any new party been registered so swiftly,\" said Yadav, during a news conference on Wednesday. \"We will move the court against the illegal decision.\"As there are no legal provisions in the Political Parties Act relating to the formation of a new party after a split in an existing one, the commission registered the new party as per the regulation on political parties.On August 18, 2021, the then Sher Bahadur Deuba government had issued an ordinance to amend the Act to ease the split of two parties—the CPN-UML and the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal. Revising a provision in the Act, which requires the support of 40 percent members both in the parliamentary party and the central committee in order to split the party, the ordinance lowered the bar to 20 percent in any one of the committees.On August 26 that year, Madhav Kumar Nepal of the UML and Mahantha Thakur of the Janata Samajbadi registered new parties, the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, respectively.Two days later, the ordinance was repealed, having served its purpose. The provisions amended by the ordinance have become void after it was repealed. Though a bill to reactivate those provisions of the Act has been registered in Parliament, it is yet to be endorsed.\"The newly formed party is neither theoretically nor in principle different [from his party],\" he said, claiming that he had always been accommodative of the leaders from the dissident faction and made lawmakers and ministers. He had nothing more to offer, according to Yadav.The split follows a long-standing discontent in the party. The leaders of the Rai-led party claim that they had to revolt against the leadership as Yadav ran the party in an autocratic manner.A faction led by the party’s federal council chair Ashok Rai on Sunday filed an application at the commission to register a new party while Yadav was on a foreign trip. The commission on Monday registered the party with seven out of 12 members of the House of Representatives. That left only five lawmakers with Yadav. The commission has summoned the leaders to verify which party they want to choose.Yadav said the split was an outcome of the false narrative that attempts were being made to topple the government. It is nothing but rumor that a new government was being formed together with the Nepali Congress and the CPN (Unified Socialist), Yadav said.After his return from foreign trip, Yadav on Tuesday met Prime Minister and CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal to assure that his party will remain in the ruling alliance.The JSP-Nepal on Tuesday itself concluded that the present alliance should continue until the next elections. Rubbishing the speculations that attempts were being made to change the present alliance, Yadav claimed that he had not met any Congress leader after the formation of the new Dahal-led government in March.The present five-party alliance was formed on March 4 after the Maoist Centre ditched the Congress to join hands with the CPN-UML. \"We will continue our support to the government. The future course will be determined on the basis of how things unfold,\" he said.Yadav claimed that the party hasn't split; only a few people had left it. \"I still hold the majority in all party structures and committees,\" he said. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n\nA man, who was injured while putting out a fire at Tapeshwar community forest in Godawari Municipality-4, Badikhel, succumbed to burn injuries on Tuesday.According to Senior Superintended of Police Shekhar Khanal of Lalitpur District Police Range, Shankar Pahari died while undergoing treatment at the Kirtipur-based Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre.Another injured, Ramesh Pahari, is being treated at the hospital.Meanwhile, a fire at Ananda forest in Godawari Municipality-6, Lele is yet to be brought under control. A total of 65 patients have been moved to a safer place after the fire spread to the premises of the Anandaban Hospital. \nAt least seven wards of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City have started segregating degradable and non-degradable waste materials from the households, as the city office has enforced waste segregation rules in those local units.According to officials at the metropolis, Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have already started segregating the waste materials generated in the households.“Waste segregation rules have been expanded to seven wards,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department under the KMC. “Four more wards—6, 20,22,23—have also been preparing to segregate the waste materials.”The metropolis started collecting segregated wastes from ward 27 in February this year. The city office has also arranged separate garbage trucks to collect segregated waste materials from households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.“Compost made from degradable waste materials is now ready and interested people can approach us for it. We will provide it free of cost,” Shrestha said. “We will give priority to the people from the wards from where waste segregation rules have been enforced.”The metropolis has planned to use the compost in the plants and flowers and the garden inside the metropolis.Along with making compost out of discarded household waste, the metropolis has been also using degradable waste to fill in the bio-methanation plant, which was provided by the European Union.Shrestha said that waste materials filled in a tank of biogas have just started to produce gas, which is being filled in biogas balloons. Once the gas is filled in biogas balloons, it can be used in cooking and generating electricity.The KMC facility can generate 15 kilowatts of electricity from biogas.Making compost from discarded waste material and generating biogas and electricity are among the measures the metropolis is working on to lessen the quantity of waste materials in the city.Officials said they have been working to segregate degradable and non-degradable waste materials in various places in the city.The 32 wards of the metropolis will be divided into eight sectors and the waste materials will be segregated in the respective blocks.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparation on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.Meanwhile, the city office on Monday issued a tender notice to sell reusable non-degradable waste worth over Rs222 million. Those waste materials were segregated from the waste dumped in the landfill site in Bancharedanda. \nA comprehensive guide for Pashmina export has been launched, aiming to facilitate small-scale businesses in Nepal. The trade facilitation guide to export Pashmina from Nepal was jointly unveiled by Myriam Ferran, deputy director general for International Partnerships of European Commission; Ambassador of the European Union to Nepal Veronique Lorenzo; Baburam Adhikari, joint-secretary at the Ministry of Industry; and Dhan Prasad Lamichhane, president of the Nepal Pashmina Industries Association, amid a function organised at the Nepal Pashmina Fibre Processing Facility in Lalitpur on Tuesday.The fibre processing facility, established with technical support from the EU-Nepal Trade and Investment Programme, was also inaugurated at the same event. The plant has been processing fibre collected from Chyangra farmers and supplying it to Pashmina producers.As part of the European Union’s broader support to strengthening the Pashmina value chain, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies developed the guide with technical support from the EU-Nepal Trade and Investment Programme implemented by the International Trade Centre.This guide is specifically tailored to enhance Nepal's Pashmina export endeavours in major international markets such as Japan, the European Union, the US, and the UK.The guide explains step-by-step processes, encompassing firm registration, licensing, directives, customs, shipment, and logistics procedures. Moreover, it offers insights into the import requirements specified by destination countries, shedding light on tariffs, quality standards, shipping costs, timeframes, and the essential documents needed, along with other crucial trade information.The ‘Nepal Trade Integration Strategy 2023’ identifies Chyangra Pashmina as a highly prioritised exportable product. Similarly, the 'Pashmina Sector Export National Strategy 2022-2026' aims to elevate Pashmina exports to the $75 million mark by 2026.Speaking on the occasion, Joint-secretary Adhikari said, “Nepal’s Himalayan Chyangra Pashmina holds a distinguished position in the international market due to its unique quality and cultural significance. The government of Nepal has designated Pashmina as one of the high-priority exportable products. The guide is poised to become a useful source of information about the process for Nepali Pashmina exports, offering comprehensive information about our destination markets.”Ferran said, “As a longstanding partner in Nepal's development journey, the European Union reaffirms its unwavering dedication to bolstering Nepal's prosperity through enhanced trade and investment avenues. This comprehensive guide serves as an instrument to support the Pashmina value chain to harness the immense potential of Nepal’s Chyangra Pashmian in the international market.” \nNcell unveils \"Sadhain ON\" campaign to advance its 5G vision by eliminating unintended data charges, reducing data plans, and offering social media data bonuses.\nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Wednesday inaugurated the EU-Nepal Business Forum 2024 stressing that the green economy would be at the centre of Nepal’s future prosperity.He said the government was reforming the legal landscape to ensure the ease of doing business and attract private investment. The prime minister said the 50 years of EU-Nepal relationship, also marks the beginning of a new chapter for shared growth and prosperity. The inauguration session was attended by Damodar Bhandari, Minister, Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, Myriam Ferran, Deputy Director General, International Partnerships, European Commission, ambassadors from eight EU Member States, and the Global Director of the European Investment Bank (EIB).Addressing the opening session, the EU Deputy Director General of International Partnerships said the European Union’s Global offer for sustainable investment, Global Gateway, was already supporting renewable energy and would further support investments in priority sectors for Nepal.The business forum brought together over 300 participants, including 50 panellists who discussed different sectors, including renewable energy, information and communication technologies, high-end tourism, and agriculture. The EU Ambassador to Nepal, Veronique Lorenzo, mentioned Nepal's achievements, such as the 64 percent growth in IT service exports in 2022 to 500 million euros and the arrival of over a million tourists in 2023. These achievements are also opportunities for European businesses.Ambassador Lorenzo added that Nepal had approved about 400 projects of around Rs47 billion since the last business forum, with notable contributions from small firms. The first EU-Nepal Business Forum was organised in 2023. \n Secretary General of the Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry Ramesh Sharma has been appointed as the Honorary Consul General of Kyrgyzstan to Nepal.The flag hosting and inauguration ceremony were held in the presence of Non-residential Ambassador to Nepal Askar Beshimov.Sharma is the chair of Sharma and Company, a construction company based in Nepal.Sharma’s appointment and establishment of the Honorary Consulate office in Nepal would foster enhancing and strengthening the bilateral economic relations between the two countries, NICCI said in a statement. Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country surrounded by China in the East, Kazakhstan in the North, Tajikistan in the Southwest, and Uzbekistan in the West. It achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved.The country is rich in hydropower, gold, rare earth metals, locally exploitable coal, oil, and natural gas, among other resources. \nAs pre-monsoon rains pick up pace, concerns mount about an imminent outbreak of the dengue disease. All that is required for the disease to flare up are stagnant water and hot temperatures, both already present in various parts of the country.“Dengue vectors are already there in many places across the country,” said Professor Murari Das, an entomologist at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “With the right conditions like water and warmth required for vector breeding available now, we can expect a spike in dengue cases in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said that 57 districts, including three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur—have already reported cases of dengue infection.“On average, around 50 people across the country are becoming infected with the dengue virus every week,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “The number could rise in the coming days, as pre-monsoon rainfall activities have recently increased.”Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease throughout the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Around 1,000 people have already been infected with the deadly disease since the start of 2024, according to officials.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of people infected with the deadly virus do not show any symptoms. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus throughout the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Experts say that this is the right time to prepare and prevent possible outbreaks in the coming days.They say that it will be too late if they wait for a massive outbreak. Authorities concerned should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance and take other measures to cut the risk, according to them. Health Ministry officials said that they have alerted all agencies concerned about the risk of a dengue outbreak.“We have alerted all relevant agencies about the risk of a dengue outbreak in the coming days,’ said Dahal. Authorities and agencies at some local units have started activities to make people aware of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, including launching an awareness drive.”Dengue has become endemic in Nepal, as cases of infection are reported throughout the year. Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities are yet to take it seriously. They believe that this lackadaisical approach is responsible for the spread of the virus. What authorities concerned do most of the time is count the number of infections and deaths, according to them.They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nIn Nepal, the Ministry of Health plans to screen pregnant women for mental health issues, aiming to reduce maternal deaths due to self-harm that have been on the rise, with such deaths accounting for 6% of the total.\n50 health workers in Kathmandu received training to screen patients for non-communicable diseases, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancer, with medications and referrals provided to patients in need.\nIn less than 2% of registered medicines tested, Nepal's drug regulator finds substandard drugs in the market despite slow testing and insufficient staff.\nDue to severe air pollution in Kathmandu and Saptari districts, an increasing number of children are suffering from childhood asthma, exacerbating public health concerns and shortening life expectancy by approximately five years.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra, a James Beard scholar, establishes 'The Sewing Tin' in New York to elevate and share Nepali cuisine globally, infusing it with modern culinary techniques and storytelling inspired by the immigrant experience.\nCeleus Baral's passion for baking led her to establish Bakeleus, an online baking shop featuring eco-conscious creations inspired by her environmental science background and a focus on patience and experimentation.\nPotato, a staple food of hundreds of thousands of people, especially those residing in the mountainous regions, is among the most widely consumed and versatile crops in Nepal. The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nSantoo Shrestha on Wednesday made history by becoming the first Nepali table tennis player to qualify for the Olympics.Shrestha qualified for the men’s singles table tennis competition at the 2024 Summer Olympics after he defeated his compatriot Samyog Kapali 11-7, 8-11, 11-7, 11-6, 8-11, 11-9 in the final of the 2024 South Asian Qualification Tournament, which was held in Table Tennis Training Centre in Kathmandu.The 2024 Olympics is scheduled to be held from July 26 to August 11 in Paris, France.Shrestha had defeated Sri Lanka’s Chameera Ginige 11-7, 11-9, 6-11, 8-11, 11-3, 11-8 to enter the gold medal match, while Kapali was a 13-11, 11-7, 12-10, 11-7 winner against Jayasanka De Silva, also from Sri Lanka.Shrestha also became the third Nepali player to qualify for the Olympics after Sangina Baidhya at Athens 2004 and Deepak Bista in Beijing 2008. Both Baidhya and Bista are taekwondo players and practitioners.Nepal will be making its 15th appearance at the Summer Olympics since making a debut in 1964.Track and field athlete Santoshi Shrestha and badminton player Prince Dahal will also represent Nepal at Paris 2024.Santoshi and Dahal gained entry into the Olympics after receiving universality spots.Santoshi will participate in the women's marathon while Dahal will compete in the men's singles badminton event.Dahal will be the first badminton player from Nepal to participate at the Olympics. \nCoach Vincenzo Alberto Annese has announced a 28-member preliminary squad for Nepal’s 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup second round qualifier match against the United Arab Emirates.Rohit Chand has returned to the squad after missing out both legs against Bahrain in March.Defenders Abhishek Limbu, Bishal Basnet, Saubhagya Rai and Ajay Chaudhary, midfielder Rohan Karki and forward Samir Tamang, who were called up for the first time for Bahrain games, have retained their place in the preliminary squad.Nepal, pitted in Group H alongside the UAE, Bahrain and Yemen, have already crashed out of the second round without playing their remaining two matches after a winless run of four successive matches left them at the bottom of the group and without a point.Nepal were scheduled to host the UAE for their second leg at the Dasharath Stadium—Nepal’s only international standard football stadium—on June 6 but will once again play their home fixture at a neutral venue, according to All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) sources. “Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has directed ANFA to find a neutral venue for the UAE fixture citing lack of standard of Dasharath Stadium,” an ANFA source said.AFC representatives had raised questions about the stadium’s pitch, flood light and security following an inspection earlier this month. AFC and ANFA, however, have yet to make their decision public.Nepal were also forced to play their home match against Bahrain at the Bahrain National Stadium in Riffa after AFC deemed Dasharath Stadium unsatisfactory to host the World Cup qualifier game.Nepal lost the double fixture against Bahrain 5-0 and 3-0, which had effectively ended Nepal’s hopes to progress to the third round and book an automatic spot in the Asian Cup.Earlier, Nepal had lost their home match against Yemen 2-0 in Kathmandu and away match to the UAE 4-0 at the Al-Maktoum Stadium in Dubai.Nepal will wrap up their qualifier campaign with a match against Yemen on June 11.Nepal still have hopes to qualify for their maiden Asian Cup. They will play in the Asian Cup Qualification (playoffs) in March next year.Nepal squadGoalkeepers: Abhishek Baral, Bishal Sunar, Kiran Chemjong, Santosh MahatDefenders: Abhishek Limbu, Ananta Tamang, Bimal Pandey, Bishal Basnet, Chhiring Lama, Rohit Chand, Sanish Shrestha, Saubhagya Rai, Ajay Chaudhary, Yogesh GurungMidfielders: Bharat Khawas, Laken Limbu, Mani Kumar Lama, Manish Dangi, Basant Jimba, Phatteman Ghale, Rohan Karki, Sumit ShresthaForwards: Anjan Bista, Dinesh Henjan, Gillespye Jung Karki, Hisub Thapaliya, Samir Tamang, Sanjeeb Bista \nRussian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing early on Thursday for talks with counterpart Xi Jinping that the Kremlin hopes will deepen a strategic partnership between the two most powerful geopolitical rivals of the United States.China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership in February 2022 when Putin visited Beijing just days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, triggering the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two.By picking China for his first foreign trip since being sworn in for a six-year term that will keep him in power until at least 2030, Putin is sending a message to the world about his priorities and the strength of his personal ties with Xi.In an interview with China’s Xinhua news agency, Putin praised Xi for helping to build a “strategic partnership” with Russia based on national interests and deep mutual trust.“It was the unprecedentedly high level of the strategic partnership between our countries that determined my choice of China as the first state that I would visit after taking office as president,” Putin said.“We will try to establish closer co-operation in the fields of industry and high technology, space and peaceful nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy sources and other innovative sectors.”Informal chats between the leaders and senior officials of both sides held over tea and dinner on Thursday are expected to be key to the two-day trip.Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said those talks would range over Ukraine, Asia, energy and trade.Putin’s newly appointed defence minister, Andrei Belousov, as well as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu and Ushakov will also attend, along with Russia’s most powerful CEOs.It was not immediately clear if Gazprom (GAZP.MM), opens new tab CEO Alexei Miller would go to China as he was on a working visit to Iran on Wednesday.Celebration of 75 years of tiesPutin, 71, and Xi, 70, will participate in a gala celebration of 75 years since the Soviet Union recognised the People’s Republic of China, which Mao Zedong declared in 1949.Xinhua confirmed Putin’s arrival for a state visit and the expected talks with Xi, while dozens of large Russian and Chinese flags fluttered around Tiananmen Square amid police patrols.Some commentaries have hailed the pair’s “great power diplomacy”.The event is the top trending item on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, with 1.4 million search requests.The United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat while U.S. President Joe Biden says this century will be defined by an existential contest between democracies and autocracies.Putin and Xi share a broad world view, which casts the West as decadent and declining, just as China challenges U.S. supremacy in everything from quantum computing and synthetic biology to espionage and hard military power.Putin will also visit the northeastern city of Harbin, which has historic ties to Russia. A mall devoted to Russian-made goods from about 80 Russian manufacturers opened on Thursday, the China Daily said.China has strengthened trade and military ties with Russia in recent years as the United States and its allies imposed sanctions on both countries, particularly Moscow, for its invasion of Ukraine.Western governments say China has played a crucial role in helping Russia withstand the sanctions and has supplied key technology that Russia has used on the battlefield in Ukraine.But China, once Moscow’s junior partner in the global Communist hierarchy, is by far the most powerful of Russia’s friends globally.Putin’s arrival follows a mission to Beijing late last month by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in part to warn China’s top diplomat Wang Yi against deepening military support for Russia. \nBANSKA BYSTRICASlovak Prime Minister Robert Fico is no longer in a life-threatening condition after he was shot in an assassination attempt when leaving a government meeting on Wednesday, a government minister said.The gunman shot Fico, 59, five times, initially leaving the prime minister in critical condition and undergoing surgery hours later on Wednesday evening.“I was very shocked ... fortunately as far as I know the operation went well - and I guess in the end he will survive ... he’s not in a life-threatening situation at this moment,” Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Environment Minister Tomas Taraba told the BBC’s Newshour.Taraba said one bullet went through Fico’s stomach and a second hit a joint.News outlet Aktuality.sk cited an unnamed source saying Fico was out of surgery and in stable condition.Defence Minister Robert Kalinak told a news briefing hours earlier that Fico had suffered “serious polytrauma” after several shot wounds.Interior Minister Matus Sutaj Estok had said earlier that Fico was in a life-threatening condition while he remained in the operating room.“This assassination (attempt) was politically motivated and the perpetrator’s decision was born closely after the presidential election,” Sutaj Estok said, referring to an April election won by a Fico ally, Peter Pellegrini.The shooting in the central Slovak town of Handlova, which Slovak media said was carried out by a 71-year-old man, stunned the small central European nation and drew international condemnation.Slovakia, a member of NATO and the European Union, has little history of political violence. Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden joined Slovakia’s EU partners in expressing shock and condemnation of the shooting.The country of 5.4 million has seen polarised political debate in recent years, including the hard-fought presidential election last month that helped tighten Fico’s grip on power.Since returning as prime minister last October, Fico has shifted policy quickly. Opposition critics call it a power grab.His government has scaled back support for Ukraine while opening dialogue with Russia, sought to weaken punishments for corruption and dismantled a special prosecutor’s office, and is revamping the RTVS public broadcaster despite calls to protect media freedom.Fico has long been critical of Slovakia’s mainstream media, refusing to speak to some outlets. Members of his party blasted media and opposition actions in recent months.“I ask all to stop piling attacks, expressions of hate, on social networks, in the media, which are aimed at that or another political camp, regardless if it concerns the (government) coalition or the opposition,” Sutaj Estok said.After the attack, Fico was rushed to hospital in Handlova where he had been chairing a government meeting. He was then transported by helicopter to regional capital Banska Bystrica for urgent treatment, it said, adding that his condition was too serious for him to be taken to Bratislava.A Reuters witness heard shots as Fico exited a building to shake hands with a crowd of people who had been waiting to greet him. Police then wrestled a man to the ground.Slovak news media reported the shooter was a former security guard at a shopping mall, an author of three collections of poetry and a member of the Slovak Society of Writers. News outlet Aktuality.sk cited his son as saying his father was the legal holder of a gun licence.“I have absolutely no idea what my father intended, what he planned, what happened,” it quoted the son as saying.Broadcaster TA3 reported the leftist prime minister had been hit in the abdomen in the attack.“I don’t think I will wake up from this,” 66-year-old Lubica Valkova told reporters on the scene. “This kind of thing just can’t happen in Slovakia.”VETERAN LEADERFico, a dominant force in Slovakia for two decades, has drawn criticism for taking a more pro-Russian stance in the Ukraine war.Describing the shooting as a “monstrous” crime, Putin said in a telegram sent to Slovakia’s President Zuzana Caputova: “I know Robert Fico as a courageous and strong-minded man. I very much hope that these qualities will help him to survive this difficult situation.”Biden offered U.S. help to Slovakia, saying in a statement: “We condemn this horrific act of violence.”Slovakia’s biggest opposition party Progressive Slovakia called off a planned protest and called for restraint to avoid escalating tensions. Parliament suspended debate indefinitely after the attack.In his career, Fico has moved between the pro-European mainstream and nationalistic positions opposed to EU and U.S. policies. He has also shown a willingness to change course depending on public opinion or changed political realities.An admirer of Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Fico has grown increasingly critical of Western support for Ukraine in its war with invading Russian forces.Fico was forced to resign as premier amid mass protests in 2018 triggered by the contract killing of Jan Kuciak, a journalist who had been investigating high-level corruption. Those protests exacerbated divisions in Slovak society that still linger. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe government will present the budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024/25 in a few days. In Nepal’s federal structure, functional responsibilities are devolved to the sub-federal levels while revenue remains centralised. The constitution aims to decentralise revenue through legislation. To achieve this, fiscal transfers to the sub-federal levels are ensured by the constitution. These fiscal transfers are done through four grants: Fiscal equalisation, conditional, special, and matching grants. Among these grants, the fiscal equalisation grant is vital; it is considered unconditional and includes full autonomy to the subnational governments.Between FY2018/19 and FY2023/24, all seven provinces received an average annual grant of Rs112 billion, while local levels received Rs261 billion. Annually, each province received an average of Rs16 billion and local levels received around Rs350 million in grants from the Government of Nepal. Although the local levels receiving Rs350 million yearly sounds positive from the outside, the situation looks disappointing from within.The principle of grants stipulates that the ratio of fiscal equalisation grants to the total budget or GDP should increase. However, this ratio has decreased. Consequently, the proportion of equalisation grants allocated to the sub-federal levels in the total budget was 10.27 percent in FY2018/19, declining to 8.34 percent in FY2023/24. This indicates a serious flaw in grant distribution, necessitating improvement. The situation is even more disappointing at the local level, where the percentage of equalisation grants among the four grants received was 41.38 percent in FY2018/19, with conditional grants comprising 53.74 percent. In FY2023/24, the percentage of equalisation grants decreased to 29.61 percent, while conditional grants increased to 65 percent. This highlights the disproportionate burden of conditional grants at the local level. The share of special and matching grants in the total grant is only 5 percent. However, the government has yet to understand the definition of a special grant. Matching grants will be distributed based on the demand of sub-federal levels to fill the resource gap in certain projects and programmes. The government will distribute the special grant based on the supply side after considering factors such as poverty scenarios, among others, at the sub-federal levels. Furthermore, this grant is also used to compensate for the Fiscal Equalisation Grant. The government has not yet considered this aspect, and it should seriously review all types of grant allocations, including special and matching grants.Grant distribution remains unfair, with no improvement in the trend of people visiting ministers and ministries for programmes and projects. From local government chiefs to federal parliamentarians, ministries are overcrowded. Many ministries allocate programme budgets at their discretion, with a significant portion favouring the constituencies of the prime minister and ministers. Subsequently, the budget is directed towards senior leaders, influential parliamentarians, secretaries, and so forth. This situation mirrors the pre-federalisation era, albeit with a slightly reduced budget being distributed haphazardly. During discussions on the ministerial budget for FY2023/24 in parliament, I raised concerns about the projects and programmes of certain ministries. The allocated program budget is even lower than that of previous village development committees.The World Bank published a report on Monday that was consistent with the facts stated above. Specifically, the report unveiled the 'Nepal Fiscal Federalism Update 2024', which aims to assess Nepal's progress in fiscal federalism and examine the alignment between the 2015 Constitution's fiscal federalism vision and present realities.The report reveals that fiscal balances of sub-federal levels slipped into deficit in FY2022/23 for the first time since the implementation of fiscal federalism in Nepal. Provincial governments recorded a consolidated fiscal balance deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in FY2022/23, attributed to decreased revenue and grants, which dropped to a record low of 3.5 percent of GDP. Conversely, expenditure saw only a marginal increase to 3.8 percent of GDP. However, there was notable variation in fiscal balances among provinces, ranging from a deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in Sudurpashchim to a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in Madhesh. Local governments also experienced a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in FY2022/23, stemming from a significant decrease in revenue and grants compared to the previous fiscal year. The report further highlights a decline in consolidated revenue and grants of sub-federal levels to a record low in FY2022/23, mainly due to reduced intergovernmental grants and revenue sharing. Provincial governments' revenue and grants dropped to 3.5 percent of GDP, driven by a decrease in intergovernmental revenue, constituting over 90 percent of provincial revenue. Local government revenue and grants declined to 8 percent of GDP in FY2022/23. Despite the decline in fiscal transfers from the federal to local levels, provincial transfers to localities remained unchanged. Notably, property taxes and local government service fees constituted over 70 percent of local governments' own-source revenue. Regarding expenditure, provincial government spending slightly increased to 3.8 percent of GDP, driven by elevated capital spending, particularly in infrastructure projects. Recurrent expenditure accounted for only 40 percent of total provincial expenditure. Conversely, local government spending saw a marginal decrease to 8.4 percent of GDP in FY2022/23 primarily due to reduced capital spending. A significant gap persists between sub-federal levels' expenditure and revenue, with only 8 percent of provincial spending and 6 percent of local spending financed by own revenue, leading to a marginal increase in the vertical fiscal gap in FY2022/23. The report also notes stagnation in own-source revenue collection, indicating moderate improvement in revenue assignment policies and weaknesses in revenue administration. It emphasises the necessity of upgrading institutional arrangements to manage the fiscal transfer system effectively. It highlights the absence of a legal provision/procedure for determining the pool of funds to be transferred through fiscal transfers and recommends increasing the ratio of Fiscal Equalisation Grants within the pool of resources to strengthen sub-federal levels' planning and decision-making. Moreover, the report suggests establishing transparent, consultative processes and technical methodologies for determining the divisible pool for fiscal transfers to enhance predictability and increase fiscal autonomy at sub-federal levels. The major challenge identified within the fiscal transfer system is the allocation of conditional grants, for which the bank proposes reducing conditional grants while enhancing fiscal equalisation, retaining conditional grants for federal responsibilities delegated to sub-federal levels, and allocating funds based on transparent criteria and procedures to align with the needs of sub-federal levels. Lastly, the report recommends determining and publishing grant amounts earlier in the fiscal year to facilitate improved planning and execution. Coming back to the budget, most ministries at the federal level act no less than those in the Rana era, with ministers often allocating budgets solely to their constituencies. Projects are frequently sent to the sub-federal levels as conditional grants. The constitution designates the province as the key entity for development, emphasising that infrastructure development should be led by the province, not the federal ministry—a principle underscored in the constitution. Out of the 22 ministries at the federal level, we need just between eight and ten, as more than half of the ministries overstep their jurisdiction. When presenting the budget, the government should embrace the spirit of the constitution and acknowledge the existence of provincial and local governments. \nMany years ago in West Bengal, I encountered school-age boys playing Carrom or cricket all day. Curious as to why they weren’t at school or out working, they responded: “We are all employed. We do party-r-byabsa (‘business of the party,’ or work for the Communist Party of India-Marxist).”“We participate in rallies, attend meetings, and mobilise people on election days. In return, the party gives us small contracts (such as repairing roads, tube wells, etc.).”This ‘business of the party’, as British Anthropologist F.G. Bailey called it, worked on the basis of parties distributing minor contracts to their workers at the grassroots level.Times have changed.Political parties are now corporate entities. They no longer depend on self-sacrificing volunteer full-timers, but party office bearers. These functionaries are paid handsomely, travel by aeroplanes or air-conditioned cars and stay in five-star hotels. They look more like party executives than workers. The party offices resemble luxurious hotels or corporate headquarters. For all this, political parties need to build a massive war chest. A part of that money must be in ‘white’—-auditable and traceable.Corporations and ultra-high net-worth individuals need the ruling parties to capture regulatory apparatus, get access to lucrative natural resources and government contracts, buy state enterprises and competitors (often taking advantage of insolvency and bankruptcy resolutions) at an undervalued price. The scandal of electoral bonds in India has revealed this new quid pro quo relationship between the ruling party and the corporate world.The sectors which purchased the bulk of the electoral bonds included mining and power generation, ‘sinful industry’ (lottery and gaming), infrastructure contractors and real estate developers, buyers of undervalued state shares, and highly regulated sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, civil aviation, banking and telecommunications. These bond purchasers stood to gain windfall profits by receiving favours from the Union government at the Centre as well as the parties running the state governments. Some companies have donated money to political parties worth more than their combined profit during the period of purchase of an electoral bond. This perhaps points to them fronting for some hidden entities. There are also allegations of shell companies donating electoral bonds. The News Minute found that many companies were raided by the Central Enforcement Directorate (which investigates money laundering) and the Income Tax Department before they purchased electoral bonds. This points to a coercive mechanism of extracting donations by the powers that be. Unsurprisingly, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has cornered a disproportionate amount of these electoral bonds, putting it in the pole position financially in the general elections in 2024.Surprisingly none of the corporate houses believed to have a close relationship with particular political parties were shown to have purchased any electoral bonds at all. The Supreme Court took a long time to pronounce a verdict but declared the electoral bonds illegal and unconstitutional. It forced the State Bank of India (the sole designated seller of the bonds) to reveal the details of the purchasers and redeemers.Nevertheless, the court allowed the recipient parties to retain and use the donations.This connection between business and politics is nothing new.At the national level, there has always been a quid pro quo relationship between the political and the business elite. The business elite funds political parties and elections in return for favourable policies pertaining to their industry.Three events have shaped these links: The liberalisation of the Indian economy in the 1980s and 1990s, the 9/11 terror attack on New York and the rise of social media. With economic liberalisation, the government’s infrastructural projects at the grassroots level increased massively, expanding the scope of offering contracts to local party leaders, workers, and followers. The commodification of land that followed was crucial. In a land-scarce country, the demand for land went up exponentially in the 1990s. Provincial political leaders in and around urban centres began to control the supply of land for real estate, industry, academic institutions and hospitals. Political parties expect their expenses covered by such local-level leaders.The bigger game is played at the national level. In a liberalised economy, monopolies and oligopolies are created not by erecting entry barriers but by strangling competition, capturing the regulatory apparatus and monopolising financial resources. The politics and business nexus help in this.The growth of social media has also come in handy for political parties in managing public perception. The parties profile and target individual voters and influence them using social media platforms. They exploit algorithms to ensure their content is spread far and wide while suppressing the opposition’s messages. This requires a vast war chest, to pay for party officials, professional agencies and IT workers. Money is also needed to place advertisements. This lavish ad spend makes the political terrain unbalanced. In certain instances, the opposition parties’ bank accounts were frozen to deprive them of money to buy advertisement slots and campaigns.The 9/11 terror attack also affected global financial transactions by forcing transparency.. Financial institutions must now do due diligence to track and audit the digital footprints of transactions. It is imperative for private corporations, and now even political parties, to maintain a clean money trail. After the electoral bonds scandal, however, India needs to rethink the regulation of political funding to create a level playing field. The transformation will not be easy. Nevertheless, there may be a way forward. First by ensuring the ruling party does not abuse the Income Tax, Enforcement Directorate and its other investigative agencies to force political donations. It should be answerable directly to Parliament and its oversight committees. Second, elections could be publicly funded. The financial resources for this could be generated from a cess 9an additional tax) on corporations and industrial use of natural resources. Third, TV and print media could be mandated to allocate advertisement slots on a proportional basis to all recognised political parties. Finally, social media and technology companies should make declarations and furnish weekly reports on the activities of political parties and their proxies. Any deviance can be flagged and blocked. -360info \n“It [Nepal] must move away from merely paying lip service to the ideals of achieving equality for all but take a concrete human rights-centric approach to relegating descent-based discrimination to the dustbins of history.” These are the powerful words of Fernanda Doz Costa, Amnesty International’s director of the gender and racial discrimination programme, at the launch of Amnesty International Nepal’s report on Dalits on May 10, 2024. Researched in 2023, the report is entitled ‘“No-one Cares”: Descent-Based Discrimination Against Dalits’.In this column, I analyse the report, focusing on its strengths and limitations while appreciating its potential value for the Dalit freedom struggle.A useful exercise All the talk about human rights and justice appears hollow in today’s world as we watch the horrifying images of the Israeli forces slaughtering tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians—many of them women and children—with total impunity. Even the United Nations has failed to stop this genocide.One wonders, then, what difference the voice of any human rights organisation or movement would make in any way, anywhere at all. While the concerns of international human rights organisations like Amnesty International may practically mean nothing for rich and powerful countries with powerful blind supporters like Israel, they could still prove useful in powerless and donor-dependent countries like ours. Here, Western governments and agencies have a degree of leverage, which could be utilised to liberate the suppressed masses. I, therefore, commend the organisation for carrying out this research on the largely forgotten caste discrimination issue. If anything, this report helps amplify voices against the persistent suffering of the Dalits and the total apathy of the state and non-state actors, both at the national and international levels. The study’s findings are largely consistent with the everyday experiences of most Dalits across the country and, to some extent, in the diaspora communities too. Additionally, the Amnesty report gives a set of specific and notable recommendations to the federal parliament, the prime minister’s office, the home ministry, as well as to the National Human Rights Commission, the Dalit Commission and UN agencies to take Dalit issues seriously and take appropriate measures to tackle them. Indeed, silence and inaction have persisted for too long while Dalits continue to be killed, injured, raped, humiliated and excluded; caste bigotry and hate are on the rise. And, as the report rightly suggests, Dalit women and girls have suffered the most. The report’s findings and recommendations can help Dalit activists raise their voices and garner wider support and solidarity for their cause. It could become a catalyst for generating greater interest in the issue and reviving and revitalising the Dalit movement, which has become dormant over the years. Forgotten religion and culture The Amnesty report repeatedly asks Nepali authorities not to limit Dalit problems to criminalisation and to find a more holistic solution. Unfortunately, the report itself lacks a nuanced or holistic analysis. Too much emphasis on impunity and an unresponsive legal and judicial system overshadows the bigger picture. The analysis is shallow, as religion and culture, the tectonic plates that move the whole thing, have been ignored. The report does occasionally mention the “Hindu caste system” but refrains from delving into it. This is a wrong approach because the fundamental underlying cause of the persistence and prevalence of caste discrimination is the Hindu religion and culture. I don’t state this as a scholar or an activist; ask any non-political and ordinary Dalit person, and the facts will become clear. In the everyday experience of the Dalits, including many Dalit leaders and activists themselves, caste-based humiliation and exclusion are based on their ritually polluted status. Lack of access to power, poverty, illiteracy and other factors are secondary. As we sometimes see in news reports, even mayors and ward or municipal chairs in many parts of the country face caste-based exclusion. I’m sure many Dalit lawmakers themselves would struggle to rent property in Kathmandu because the landlords fear offending their ancestral spirits and other deities through contact with the ritually polluted! Herein lies the root of the problem: Nepalis are highly religious and spiritual people who live in constant fear and awe of their gods, their lineage deities, and the spirit of their dead ancestors. There is a strong belief that any transgression of the traditional ritual hierarchy based on caste would offend the supernatural powers, thereby causing death and destruction in the family and community. Caste is so sacred that many Nepalis would rather go to jail or even die than flout certain caste rules and “invite” the terrible wrath of their gods or deceased relatives. For these fundamentalists, state laws and law enforcement hardly mean anything.Why has there been a surge in attacks against the Dalits in recent years? Why don’t many police officers, administrators and judges take the caste discrimination issue seriously? Why do prime ministers and ministers and legislators turn a deaf ear to Dalit voices for change? Why have Dalit activists themselves not been very effective in defending their rights? All these questions can be answered with just two words: Religion and culture. There is a contradiction between state laws and religious/cultural laws. Today’s policemen and judges probably don’t need to be preached about universal human rights, but they also cannot deny their long-standing cultural and spiritual beliefs and practices of keeping their castes sacred. If religio-cultural traditions have greatly ‘caste-ified’ our social psychology, how can those in legal and judicial power positions be immune from it? This is the crux of the problem that needs unpacking by all sides.Problem with methodology?I understand the sensitivities surrounding religion and culture in any country or society. I don’t know why the Amnesty report remained silent on these complex yet vital issues. However, I suspect part of the problem lies in the research methodology itself. If you want new insights into any topic, you must involve and work with the younger generation. During the report’s launch, I saw the same old faces of Dalit activists and lawyers. I don’t mean to undermine their ongoing and historical contribution, but the new and younger generation also deserves a voice. The report was prepared with support from and consultation with Dalit non-governmental organisations that have long been commanded by the same old people. Moreover, they are usually connected to a political party, and upper-caste leaders invariably control every party. No wonder, mainstream Dalit discourse is still shy about putting religion and culture in the spotlight. The report itself makes it amply clear that the Dalit movement thus far has been toothless and that there is a need for new ways of tackling the problem. However, to show a new direction for freedom fighters and organise a paradigm shift, international players must move beyond their usual consultation with the same old activists and groups and find new kids on the block. Talking directly with the ordinary Dalits instead of through mediation with established groups would make ground realities apparent.  \nSenior leaders from seven major political parties—both the ruling as well as opposition forces—on Sunday made an unequivocal collective pledge to make maximum effort to promote the country’s investment and business climate. Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, CPN (Maoist Centre) vice-chair Pampha Bhusal, Rastriya Prajatantra Party chair Rajendra Lingden, Rastriya Swatantra Party Chief Whip Santosh Pariyar, CPN (Unified Socialist) General Secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal and Janamat Party chair CK Raut, while airing their respective party’s views at the Kantipur Economic Summit-2024, also emphasised the need for the political forces and other stakeholders to work hand in hand in order to attract investment.It was just two weeks ago that top leaders of the country including Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba of Nepali Congress and KP Sharma Oli, chair of a major coalition partner CPN-UML, while addressing the two-day Investment Summit, committed to spare no effort to turn Nepal into an investment-friendly destination. Presenting Nepal as a country of huge potential, the leaders made the promises before 1,600-plus representatives from 55 countries in the government-organised summit. Realisation of the need for domestic as well as foreign investments and joint political commitments of rival political forces in itself is a positive gesture.However this is not enough. Nepal’s politicians have time and again made such promises but failed to translate them into results. For that, Nepal still needs political as well as policy stability and predictability. Various countries have made tremendous progress even when there is instability in government leadership. They did so by keeping development activities separate from politics and ensuring policy predictability, even if there are constant changes in governments. One big concern of the representatives from the business communities expressed at the Kantipur Economic Summit was the same. They said genuine investors seek policy predictability as a prerequisite before making a sizable investment. This is a valid concern and the policy makers must ensure so much.Yet the initiatives of the government and our politicians appear more superficial than substantive. Just ahead of the investment summit, the government amended some Acts through an ordinance to clear legal complexities for investment. It was the government’s intent to create an impression before the international participants that Nepal is serious about getting money from abroad. But the ordinances couldn’t be tabled in the first meeting of the House of Representatives on Friday due to the ongoing obstruction of the main opposition party Nepali Congress. There is a prolonged deadlock in Parliament. The ruling and opposition parties are in a face-off over a parliamentary panel to probe Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The minister is accused of involvement in multiple cooperative frauds. The House obstruction by the main opposition over the demand first made in the winter session has continued even after the commencement of the budget session on May 10. If our political parties cannot even come together to pass the national budget, it would be hard for foreigners to trust us with their money. The only way Nepal will attract quality investment and make a leap in its development endeavour is through a collective political effort to ensure policy consistency. For the country’s larger good, they must also be able to see beyond their partisan interests.  \nAs the midsummer mercury rises, storing fresh food remains a challenge. In a country where the usage of refrigerators remains limited to urban areas, there is a risk of food getting contaminated. Moreover, our general attitude towards food safety and preservation, especially in eateries, is casual. For instance, we see meat shops openly displaying raw meat items all day on tables and showcases, without the use of freezers. Sweet shops and restaurants are no better, as they are tempted to display their food items to attract customers. Even though the food might look appealing to our eyes when it is served in eateries, it is ultimately harmful to our health as many do not follow the proper food safety protocols. The open display of food items invites bacteria and dust contamination, apart from the obvious heat-related hazards, leading to the onslaught of various diseases, including cholera and food poisoning, apart from a lack of nutrition. Although Nepal has food safety regulations in place, the lack of implementation and monitoring continues to pose the risk of food-borne diseases to the public. The Food Act, 2023 (1967) prohibits the production, sale or distribution of adulterated foodstuff or sub-standard foodstuff. By adulterated foodstuff, the Act means \"foodstuffs rotten so as to be harmful to health, or prepared or kept in a filthy or toxic condition\". In January last year, Nepal implemented a new set of food safety regulations, which has provisions for the careful production, processing, packaging, handling, storage and supply purity of food. The regulations also have provisions for labelling the food, including its nutritional value.However, apart from poor implementation of such regulations, the monitoring of the regulations is almost non-existent. In rare instances when food inspectors from municipalities bother to monitor the food in eateries, there is a high chance of such eateries being found flouting the regulations. For instance, in Kathmandu, as in most parts of the country, food items, especially items like meat that get contaminated quickly, are laid out in the open and sold. This causes great health risks, but the authorities of all levels of government seem either oblivious to or uninterested in the issue. In Kathmandu Metropolitan City, for instance, the authorities' focus is on removing the food vendors altogether, guided by a flawed notion of gentrification rather than regulating them under tax and food safety regimes. In other parts of the country, hardly anyone bothers to check the quality of food provided to customers.The state cannot remain a mute spectator when the health of the citizens is put at risk due to the carelessness of vendors. Rather, the state should strictly maintain food safety standards regularly—not in an episodic pattern, such as during festivals or at the whims of authorities but as a standard practice. Some basic steps include making it mandatory for vendors to keep appropriate food items in freezers, use covering, and segregate food items to avoid cross-contamination. As the culture of eating out is becoming increasingly common, especially among young people, the state should actively enforce food preservation and safety regulations to keep the citizens healthy. \nThe investigation into the Nepal Children’s Organization land lease scam has entered a significant stage, with the Central Investigation Bureau issuing arrest warrants against 20 of the accused. The individuals against whom the warrants have been issued after a nod from the Kathmandu District Court include former office bearers of the organisation and representatives of business institutions that have benefitted from the scam. With the latest development, some of the organisation’s prominent individuals, including the then vice-chair Tulasi Narayan Shrestha, then general secretary Ganesh Bhakta Shrestha, then deputy general secretary Suman Shakya and then member Krishna Shankar Sah face arrest. The CIB has also issued arrest warrants against then chairperson of Brihaspati Vidya Sadan, Chiranjivi Tiwari, and others, including Pravin Raj Joshi, Murari Nidhi Tiwari, Abhinav Singhania and Siddharth Kedia. The arrests follow an investigation on the complaint that 29 ropanis (14,753.25 square metres) of land belonging to the children’s organisation had been illegally leased out to Brihaspati Vidya Sadan school for Rs9 million a year. The school is known to have sub-leased five ropanis (2,543.66 square metres) to Rai School at a rate of Rs6 million a year. The land was leased to Brihaspati Vidya Sadan for 59 years in various instalments since 1992, when Vaidya was the organisation’s chairperson. Under his leadership, the organisation in 2015 leased the land to Brihaspati Vidya Sadan for another 43 years through a sub-lease deal 16 years before the existing lease expired. Brihaspati Vidya Sadan had also allegedly used the government land illegally to take a loan of Rs313.3 million. The Nepal Children’s Organization had on April 27 scrapped the lease deal and subsequently filed a case with the CIB against the individuals signing the lease as well as against the proprietors of Brihaspati Vidya Sadan.Illegality of the lease apart, what is disturbing about the children organisation’s lease scam is that private entities have used the support system for the disadvantaged and orphan children to accumulate capital. Bishal Group, the mother organisation of the school that took the land on lease, even planned to build a 10-storey business complex on the land before it was stalled at the lawmakers’ intervention. Even as the children in the orphanage live substandard lives, the property at a prime location in Kathmandu continues to be misused. The arrest warrants, therefore, are a big step towards reclaiming the land that rightly belongs to the organisation and, by extension, the children.Moreover, the children organisation’s lease scam is a disturbing reminder of other major land grab scams that have grabbed public attention over the past few years—those related to the Lalita Niwas and the Bansbari Chhala Jutta. Huge portions of both these public properties have over the decades been illegally transferred to private individuals and entities, often in collusion with government officials. There certainly are many more such cases of illegal land grabs across the country, and the government should work aggressively to get such properties back. Further, the media’s reporting on the Nepal Children's Organization, the Lalita Niwas and the Bansbari Chhala Jutta land grab scams have been laudable—in the true spirit of a public watchdog. There should be no let-up in this.  \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   \nThe budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nPeople lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. \nThe third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit starts today. At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepal’s political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investors—from India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Group—were interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Let’s invest in Nepal. \nPolitical parties’ unhealthy activities to form provincial governments has taken the form of an ugly competition and increased the public’s frustration with the provinces. Separately, leaders of major political parties have started to blame the mixed electoral system for Nepal’s perpetual instability. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to political analyst Tula Narayan Shah to discuss these and other related issues.Nepali politics has entered yet another phase of endless bickering over power after the March 4 change of the ruling coalition. Politicians have resorted to every possible tactic to get leadership in provincial governments. How do you analyse this trend?I am not surprised. It is natural in the kind of parliamentary system that we practise. We adopted the parliamentary model in federal and provincial levels while the one at our local level is similar to the presidential system. Local unit chiefs and deputies are elected directly by the people and they can serve five-year terms. That has ensured stability there. Provincial governments on the other hand are destabilised when there is any change at the centre.Leaders have started blaming the electoral system for hung parliaments and instability. Is the problem in the system or with our leaders?Some senior leaders in major parties now blame the electoral system. Even the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Office of the Auditor General have recommended changes in the electoral model, arguing that the current one had promoted corruption in the country. I am not convinced. Politicians argue that no political party could garner a majority in this system and that led to instability. I rather hold politicians’ personal ambition and corrupt political culture responsible. General secretary of a major political party recently argued that it will be better for national politics to be driven by two political parties. Nepal conducted eight general elections (in 1959, in 1991, in 1994, in 1999, in 2008, in 2013, in 2017 and in 2022) under a multi-party system. Forget the 1959 polls. Of the three polls held in the 1990s, the Nepali Congress got majority in 1991 and 1999. Also, during those years, two parties—the Congress and the CPN-UML—dominated Nepali politics. Did a single-party majority and dominance of two parties provide stability? Not at all. Rather, personal rivalries of the Congress leaders invited instability. Fast forward to 2017 elections. The UML and the Maoist Centre formed an alliance and jointly fought elections. They later merged to form the Nepal Communist Party, which had a comfortable majority. Again the rivalry of the top leaders within the party caused instability. These instances show that a majority for a single party doesn’t necessarily translate into stability.I rather see a conspiracy behind blaming the electoral system. In the 1990s, Nepal adopted the first-past-the-post system to elect all lawmakers. Around 70 percent national seats were controlled by two castes—Brahmin and Chhetri. In 2008, we adopted a mixed electoral system, which was a demand of the 2006 people’s movement, the Maoist insurgency and the Madhesh agitation. The proportional representation category significantly increased representation of women, dalits, Madheshi and indigenous communities in the legislature, whereas the representation of the males of Khas-Arya groups, who were historically ruling the country, decreased drastically.Who are those elected the most under the FPTP system?The FPTP electoral system has certain attributes that are more conducive to some groups than others. ‘High-caste males’ win more elections. Females have less of a chance. But dalits also have less chance even if the candidate is male. Those like contractors, landlords and businesspeople who can freely spend win elections. Likewise, those who are well-connected with the power centres in Kathmandu can influence elections. Chhetris and Thakuris were dominant in Panchayat politics. Brahmins got stronger after the 1990 political change. Also those who have access and visibility in media and other public forums have better chances of being elected under the FPTP.Some leaders who have these capabilities have won elections in different systems. There is one Madheshi leader, who won election in Panchayat, got tickets from Congress and won again in the multiparty system. Later he joined a Madhesh-based party and won. So, high-caste males and those with access to power corridors in Kathmandu want FPTP. Whereas, women, dalits and those from marginalised communities prefer PR.A general perception is that those who are directly elected are competent ones and can deliver whereas those from the PR category are there just for the sake of representation. Do you agree?Leaders didn’t pick the candidates properly under the PR category. They picked their loved or loyal ones or sold these seats for hefty monetary returns. Leaders from Madheshi and indigenous communities fought for this system. But the same Madheshi leaders kept the names of their wives, daughters and other family members at the top of the PR list. Thus leaders misused and defamed the electoral system. So, the debate should be focused on correcting the wrong practices, not scrapping the system itself.Provinces replicated all the wrong practices of the centre and did even worse.We adopted the same parliamentary system in provinces. So the same thing happened there. Conversely, local units are different as the system there is different. Therefore, we have to go for directly elected executive heads at the centre as well as provinces. Let’s elect the prime minister and chief ministers directly. That will give us stability. Senior leaders from the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre have proposed changing the electoral system but they haven’t proposed direct election of the prime minister and chief ministers. So, the solution is direct election of executive heads, as in Palikas. Scrapping of the PR system won’t help.What if a wrong person gets elected to the post and can’t be removed for five years?In a democracy, you have to trust the people. Nepali citizens are the ones who removed monarchy. Can’t they unseat a leader elected by their votes? In a direct election, even a person from outside the political parties may emerge. So, politicians are afraid because traditionally they exert control over candidacy and various other things through the parties. Many think of provinces as an unnecessary burden on state coffers. Is that the case?I don’t think so. State restructuring was one of the major demands of the Maoist insurgency, Madhesh movement and the 2006 People’s Movement. Why did they ask for it? Because Nepal was a heavily centralised state and it wasn’t inclusive. Federalisation of the state, inclusive electoral system and reservation quotas in civil service were the three components of state restructuring.But why did the provinces then fail to deliver and win public trust?The stakeholders spent around a decade deciding what type of provinces should be carved out. Even pro-federalists didn’t debate how to make the provinces functional. Those who lobbied in favour of the federal system have now become defensive. Some are silent. The political party [which is led by Upendra Yadav] that fought for the federal system has been leading the government in Madhesh for the past six years. But they haven’t given any relief to the common people through the provincial government. People have an impression that the provincial system has added corruption and it is only for the leaders and their cronies, not the common people.Are the leaders really corrupt or do they lack efficiency?Even the Maoist and Madheshi parties that promised to be different to the Congress and the UML couldn’t come up with a roadmap to make the federal system and state agencies more meaningful for the people. They only indulged in power politics, just like other parties. That frustrated the people.You recently travelled to various parts of Madhesh province. How are the sub-national administrations working and what is the public mood there?A society where people are aware, educated and active helps make leaders as well as administration accountable. Authorities are found to be working arbitrarily in the places where people can’t question their wrongdoing. We find relatively better administration in the mid-hill regions, where Brahmins and Chhetris have dominant presence as they have better understanding of the system, laws and other information. Such a mid-hill area expands from the eastern border to Lumbini Province. In this belt, people can raise questions and make the administration accountable. Women’s status is better while caste-based discrimination is less. Local units, schools, health posts, and administrative units work well. Conversely, these aspects are weak in Karnali, Sudurpaschim, inner Madhesh and in the northern belt as there is no critical mass capable of questioning the authorities.You should understand that there are two Madhesh belts. One is along the East-West Highway, second is the bordering area. The belt along the highway has a diverse social composition. There is dominance of the people who migrated from the hills. Development indicators are better and so is the presence of state agencies. The more you move south, the more you find homogenous populations of Madheshi origin. Traditional power relations haven’t changed there. Patron-client dynamics still stand. Certain individuals have key roles in elections and other important activities. They take the decision on behalf of other common people. We find similar practice in the northern belt as well but not in the mid-hill and highway areas.Many say local units perform better than provinces. What is the perception on the ground?Local level is equipped with needed authority. Provinces should be given powers to make them effective as per the spirit of federalism. The present system was designed by reluctant federalists. Therefore, what we need is a fresh debate on the reforms of provinces. There are two conflicting claims. A section of the society says provinces have misused their authority and failed to deliver. Others say the provinces need more authority for effective functioning.It is true that provinces have failed to use the authority they have. Provinces have their legislatures that prepare their budgets and their governments can implement it. Give me an example of an exemplary and innovative initiative taken by any of the seven provinces in the past six years. Madhesh Province started the ‘Beti Padhau Beti Bachau’ campaign but corruption doomed it. People started raising questions, “why do we need provinces, if the leaders there are to copy the same corrupt activities of the centre?”Madheshi leaders opposed the hill people’s dominance and discriminatory practices in the central administration. But the same Madheshi leaders aren’t promoting an inclusive system in Madhesh. Around 20 percent of the total Madhesh population are dalits. The government in the province has changed multiple times. But how many dalits have been ministers in the provincial Cabinets? There are 136 local units in Madhesh Province. But only one mayor and two deputy-mayors are from the dalit community. Just like a set of elite people has captured Kathmandu’s politics, another set of elites has captured the politics of Janakpur.How do Madheshi people look at provinces?People in Kathmandu, mid-hills, and some other places can be heard saying provinces should be scrapped. Common people in Madhesh don’t say so. But they have dissatisfaction with the parties who championed the federal system. They say, “our lives are the same even in the federal system”.How do you analyse the performance of two new parties in Madhesh—Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti?Overall, three parties emerged from the 2022 elections. The Rastriya Swatantra Party emerged from the areas with a dominant presence of hill people. The Janamat Party won from eastern Tarai and the Nagarik Unmukti Party from the western part of the southern belt. The Janamat says the agenda of discrimination against Madhesh is still relevant but they oppose the leadership of the Janata Samajbadi Party and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The old Madheshi parties spoke against Kathmandu’s discrimination but they themselves didn’t work to remove discrimination when they led the government in Madhesh. Besides, they didn’t speak against bad governance. Now, the Janamat’s agenda is to fight discrimination and bad governance, both by Kathmandu as well as the old Madheshi parties.The RSP’s emergence is against “the bad governance of the Congress and the UML”. Its major agenda is good governance. It doesn’t care about discrimination. But bad governance isn’t an agenda of Nagarik Unmukti. The party that emerged mainly after the Tikapur incident is against the discrimination of Tharu community. The dispute in the party is family-based and the outfit hasn’t taken the form of a political party. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nOur attention has been drawn to a news report published by The Kathmandu Post regarding our operations in Helambu (‘Helambu administration says Melamchi project didn’t pay promised tax’, March 31).Quoting the rural municipality, the paper writes, ‘Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, the Chinese contractor company of the project, has not paid for the resources—slates, stones, soils and other riverbed materials—used while constructing Ambathan dam and other infrastructures in Helambu Rural Municipality Ward No 1.’ Our main objection goes with this sentence of the news. Sinohydro began completing the uncompleted infrastructures of the Melamchi Water Supply Project after making a formal agreement with the concerned agencies of the Government of Nepal. We have signed the terms and conditions and we assure you that we abide by the clauses mentioned in the agreement. As a construction company, we managed construction materials from different legal sources. Some materials were imported from foreign countries while some of them were purchased locally and also some of them is recycling of discarded bulk rock and soil from the tunnel or dam excavation period. As mentioned in the news, the company used slates, stones, soil and other riverbed materials in the infrastructure, but all these materials were used under construction for three major purposes. The first one is aggregate used for mixing concrete and backfill work which were legally bought from local vendors and suppliers with fully paid taxes. The second one is backfill stone used for gabion wall work. The last one is the hard stone used for laying weir lining. The latter two were recycled excavated mucking rock heaped up in the construction field rather than the river bed materials. For the aggregate, the company has paid all the vendors and suppliers for the materials they supplied and we believe that all of the vendors and suppliers are satisfied with the company. The entire bill, invoices, payment receipts, dispatches and all other documents of transactions and payments concerning the local and the foreign vendors and suppliers are transparent, and are kept safely in the company’s office. The news report is misleading, and should be amended.Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, via email \nWe understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019. Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal \nI am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25). I would like to add that much of what we achieved at SOAS University of London would not have been possible without the contribution of my colleague Krishna Pradhan. Pradhan taught Nepali at SOAS for 15 years until his own early retirement in 2019, and was greatly admired by the many students who learned so much from him. His presence at SOAS also enabled me to develop courses in Nepali literature, history and culture alongside the essential language courses. Sadly, none of this will be available to future generations of students in the UK.Michael Hutt,Emeritus Professor of Nepali and Himalayan Studies,SOAS, University of London \nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe Patan High Court on Wednesday acquitted cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane of rape.Overturning the verdict of the Kathmandu District Court, a division of bench of judges Surya Darshan Dev Bhatta and Anju Uprety Dhakal gave a clean chit to Lamichhane, who was on suspension from the national cricket team. The high court cited lack of evidence while overturning the decision of its subordinate court.“The verdict from the district court has been fully overturned,” said Tirtharaj Bhattarai, spokesperson at the High Court. “The defendant Sandeep Lamichhane has been acquitted.”A single bench of district judge Shishir Raj Dhakal on December 29, 2023 had convicted Lamichhane of rape, but the penalty was determined later, on January 10. The court had ordered a jail term and fine of half a million rupees for the alleged rape, which is said to have occurred in August 2022. The half a million rupees—of which Rs300,000 is fine and the remaining compensation—would be paid to the victim, the court had ordered.The jail term and penalty were determined considering the age of Gaushala-26 (the name given to the victim), the social status of the accused when the incident happened and the mental stress the victim had to suffer. The court, however, had dismissed the victim’s claim that she was a minor at the time of incident. The court had also refused to accept the birth dates mentioned in her academic documents, which show she was 17 at the time of the incident.Not satisfied with the order, the district attorney and Lamichhane had moved the high court. While the district attorney had challenged the decision that refused to accept the victim as a minor, Lamichhane had denied the charge and demanded acquittal. The high court has now passed a verdict as demanded by Lamichhane.“The division bench has refused to accept that the victim was a minor as claimed by the government side,” said Bhattarai. “It also found insufficient evidence to pronounce him guilty.” The detailed basis for the acquittal will be explained in the verdict’s full text, which will be issued later, according to the court official.The lawyers, who deliberated from the victim’s side, claim the way the questions were put before Gaushala-26 during the hearing had indicated that Lamichanne would be acquitted. “His celebrity status prevailed over justice. I am extremely sad to witness this,” said advocate Mohna Ansari, who had advocated on the victim’s behalf. “This is a good example of miscarriage of justice.”The high court’s ruling can be challenged in the Supreme Court. Generally, the government attorney challenges the decision of the lower courts in the top court if they don’t pass a favourable verdict .“We hope the government side will challenge the high court’s verdict at the Supreme Court,” said Ansari who also is a former member of the National Human Rights Commission. “Otherwise, the victim herself can appeal, which she will be doing.”Lamichhane was accused of raping the girl in a Kathmandu’s Tilganga-based hotel on August 21, 2022. After hearing the lawyers on both sides, the district court ruled “there was no dispute that Lamichhane and the victim had stayed in the same room of the hotel where she was raped.” It had claimed that the accused had raped the victim by taking advantage of her poor economic condition and misusing his stardom.During the months-long hearing, the court also examined different documents of the victim relating to her age.After examining Gaushala 26’s birth registration at Raluka VDC, Nuwakot; migration registration at Shankarapur Municipality, Kathmandu; birth registration at Narayani Sub-regional Hospital, Birgunj; and her own statement, the district court had determined that she was born on July 4, 2004, and was 18 years old when the alleged incident happened. Despite overturning the decision of penalty determined by the district court, the high court has reached the same conclusion when it comes to the age of the victim.Gaushala-26 had lodged her complaint against Lamichhane on September 6, 2022, two weeks after the incident.When the investigation started, Lamichhane was in the West Indies to play in the Caribbean Premier League. He was arrested from the Tribhuvan International Airport upon his return on October 6, 2022.On November 4 last year, the Kathmandu District Court ordered that Lamichhane be sent to the Sundhara-based Central Jail after a detention hearing.Lamichhane had moved the high court, challenging the order.On January 12, a division bench of high court judges Dhruva Raj Nanda and Ramesh Dahal decided to release him on bail while the investigation continued. Following the verdict, Lamichhane was released from custody on January 13 after posting a bail of two million rupees. The court, however, had barred him from travelling abroad and ordered him to inform the police beforehand if he had to leave Kathmandu.Dissatisfied with the travel restrictions, Lamichhane moved the Supreme Court, challenging the high court’s decision. On February 27, a division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Kumar Chudal had ruled in favour of the cricketer’s petition, allowing him to travel abroad to play cricket.Despite being convicted, Lamichhane didn’t face jail as he was allowed to appeal without being behind bars. Meanwhile, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) on Wednesday lifted its suspension of former national cricket captain Lamichhane, paving the way for his return to the national team and the T20 World Cup squad.The decision to lift the suspension came hours after the Patan High Court acquitted Lamichhane of rape on appeal, overturning the verdict of the Kathmandu District Court to sentence him to eight years in jail.“As the Patan High Court has issued a verdict on May 15, 2024, giving Sandeep Lamichhane a clean chit, we have decided to lift his suspension from all forms of domestic and international cricketing activities,” CAN said in a statement.The lifting of suspension has now paved the way for Lamichhane to travel to the West Indies and the United States to take part in the World Cup.Nepal have already announced a provisional 15-member squad for the 2024 T20 World Cup but are allowed to make changes to the initial selections until May 25.CAN has already started preparations to send Lamichhane to the World Cup, according to CAN treasurer Padam Khadka.Lamichhane was in Trinidad & Tobago to play in the Caribbean Premier League from Jamaica Tallawahs when “Gaushala 26” filed the rape complaint.Following the rape charge and subsequent arrest warrant issued by the Kathmandu District Court, CAN had dismissed Lamichhane as national captain and suspended him from cricket.He returned to the national team in February last year and participated in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 home tri-series against Namibia and Scotland, after he was freed on bail.He also travelled to Zimbabwe in June last year to participate in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier and to India to play the 2023 Asia Cup three months later.However, he was suspended from cricketing activities again following Kathmandu District Court’s verdict.“I have said from the first day that I am innocent. I am grateful to those who supported me,” Lamichhane said after getting the clean chit.“I will make every effort to take Nepali cricket to a new height.” \nNepal’s two biggest parties are making scathing criticism of each other.Senior coalition partner CPN-UML and the main opposition Nepali Congress, which is the largest party in the House of Representatives, have trained their guns on each other over the recent Supreme Court verdict on a multi-billion-rupee land swap scam.After the Supreme Court on May 12 issued the full text of its verdict related to the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate, at the prime location of Birtamod in Jhapa, the Congress demanded an investigation into those involved in making the decision on the land swap.Terming the court verdict as historic, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa posted a statement on social media on Tuesday, saying: “It has now been proven that the then government’s decision was wrong … Therefore, there should be further investigation against those involved.”The Supreme Court on February 7 overturned the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli government's decision. On April 26, 2021, the Oli-led government allowed the use of the land exempting the ceiling for the deal. However, the constitutional bench, headed by Bishowambar Prasad Shrestha, ruled that Oli’s Cabinet decision contravened Section 12 (C) of the Land Act 1964 and was immature.The court also ruled against allowing the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding the legal ownership ceiling in any other place within Koshi Province, highlighting the legal implications of the land reforms.The requirement to first examine the specific land’s detailed area has been upheld by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench in the full text of the verdict. The land that is being considered for a swap ought to yield comparable value, read the court’s final verdict. But the tea estate is trying to swap its land in Birtamod, reportedly valued at Rs200 million per bigha, with low-price land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.While considering a swap, there must be a feasibility study to assess the new location’s production capacity. Technical experts’ advice ought to be followed in this context, reads the full text of the court.“It [the court verdict] has not just confirmed how wrong and corrupt the decisions and law amendments made by the government of the time were, but has also exposed policy-level corruption. There is no longer any doubt that such a decision is unfair and ill-intended. Therefore, further investigation is warranted,” Thapa wrote. When the Congress general secretary tried to bash the UML over the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate incident, UML chair Oli accused the Congress of selling 70 bighas of the estate in return for hefty commissions. Oli made the accusation while addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the UML on Wednesday. “The Congress should be careful when commenting on the UML on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate,” Oli said. “They once sold 51 bighas of land and later 19 bighas in the name of land swapping, just for commissions.”When the government in 2018 tried to swap the Giri Bandhu land, the court stopped it, saying there were no legal provisions to do so. “Abiding by the court’s ruling, we later formulated the law, but the court now has found the fault with it,” Oli said.The Congress has been cornering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane over his involvement in the co-operatives funds’ embezzlement. With this agenda the party also has been disrupting Parliament. But the ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being biassed against Lamichhane. And it is Oli and his CPN-UML party that has come to Lamichhane’s most resolute defence.The Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday decided to take up the issue of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in a serious manner.But Congress leaders deny that bringing up the tea estate issue is its calculated strategy to corner the ruling parties. “The parliamentary party meeting decided to take up this issue given the gravity of the matter. There is no ulterior motive,” Sanjay Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post. Meanwhile, Gautam also said the party will study Oli’s allegations against his party. When the Oli government amended laws related to land-swapping, Thapa of the Congress, who demanded an investigation into the Oli Cabinet’s decision, was a House member. Not only Thapa but most senior Congress leaders were members of Parliament at the time of the amendment.“Though one can question those involved in the law amendment on moral grounds, they cannot be held accountable on legal grounds,” Om Parkash Aryal, an advocate who was among those challenging the Oli government’s decision in the court, told the Post. “In such instances, it’s the government that makes such a decision which comes under the question.”King Mahendra’s implementation of land reforms in 2021 BS, through enacting the Land Act 2021 BS, was a momentous step. The law fixed the ceiling of land possession by individuals at 28 bighas in Tarai districts. The land exceeding the ceiling would be nationalised. Landlords close to the then royal palace were taken into confidence for the law’s implementation, and the palace made it clear that land used for industrial and agricultural purposes would not be nationalised.According to Section 12 of the Land Act 2021, land used for industrial, agricultural, cooperative farming, educational, or medical purposes is not put under the limit.Budhkaran Rajbanshi, a landlord in Jhapa considered close to the royal palace, was informed in prior that if he established a tea estate, the land beyond the ceiling would not be nationalised.To save his land, he founded the Budhkaran Tea Estate there. Three additional Jhapa landlords, the Giri brothers (Prem Kumar Giri, Krishna Kumar Giri, and Trilochan Giri) also received similar information. In Birtamod, Jhapa, the Giri brothers owned 500 bighas. Before the Land Reforms Act came into effect, the Giri brothers proceeded to register the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in order to safeguard the property. Land reform laws introduced later did not apply to the land as it had already been used for agricultural purposes. \nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday issued an interlocutory interim order against the decision of the Election Commission to register the Ashok Rai-led group as a party.Responding to a writ petition filed by Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal) Chairman Upendra Yadav, a single bench of Justice Binod Sharma ordered the election body to put the party registration process on hold, for now.Yadav on Monday moved the apex court, challenging the election body's decision to recognise the JSP-Nepal’s splinter group as a party. In his petition, Yadav accused the commission of registering the party despite its failure to meet the criteria, that is support of 40 percent of members both from the party’s central committee and the parliamentary party.Though Rai was supported by seven of the party's 12 lawmakers, he showed the support of only 30 members of the central committee. According to officials at the election body, the Yadav-led party has 406 members in its central committee.Yadav had named the Election Commission and others as defendants and has demanded that the commission’s decision to give recognition to the newly formed party be scrapped. Yadav has also sought a mandamus order from the apex court demanding that the status of the defecting leaders as lawmakers be scrapped.An interlocutory interim order has been issued to put the decisions taken on May 6 and thereafter on hold as it seems appropriate to reach a conclusion only after following the discussions with the Election Commission, the bench said.The court has summoned both the parties for a next hearing on May 21.On May 5, Ashok Rai, the federal council chair of the Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal), along with six other lawmakers and 30 central committee members of the party split the JSP-Nepal to form a new outfit Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP). The JSP-Nepal had altogether 12 lawmakers in the House of Representatives.The Rai-led faction submitted an application to the Election Commission to register the new party on May 5. The next day, the election body registered the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.As the legal provisions in the Political Parties Act relating to the formation of a new party after a split in an existing one have been invalidated, the commission registered the new party as per the regulation on political parties.On August 18, 2021, the then Sher Bahadur Deuba government had issued an ordinance to amend the Act to ease the split of two parties—the CPN-UML and the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal.Revising a provision in the Act, which requires the support of 40 percent members both in the parliamentary party and the central committee in order to split a party, the ordinance lowered the bar to 20 percent in any one of the committees.On August 26 that year, Madhav Kumar Nepal of the UML and Mahantha Thakur of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal registered new parties, the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, respectively.Two days later, the ordinance was repealed, having served its purpose. The provisions amended by the ordinance have become void after it was repealed. Though a bill to reactivate the provisions of the Act has been registered in Parliament, it is yet to be endorsed. \nNepal and Lithuania established diplomatic ties in February 2005. Nepal designated its Embassy in Copenhagen (Denmark) as a non-resident mission to Lithuania, and the Lithuanian Embassy in New Delhi represents Lithuania in Nepal. There have been minimal contacts and exchanges between the two countries. Trade, tourism and investment relations between the two countries are at a very low level. The Post caught up with Diana Mickeviciene, the ambassador of Lithuania to India, during her recent visit to Nepal to discuss Lithuania’s cutting-edge technology and its graduation to a developed economy, as well as bilateral economic, trade and tourism relations between the two small nations. Excerpts:Tell us about the bilateral economic and trade relations between Nepal and Lithuania.We are both small countries, far away from each other. But some trade is going both ways. For instance, we have exported medical cotton to Nepal in large quantities. And we have been buying tea and spices from Nepal. However, the trade amount is not very big. I think the biggest exchange we already have is the trade of services. Currently, there are some businesses that are trading services which are not reflected in the conventional trade balance. Our (Lithuania) economy is small but very innovative and digitalised. My country has gone far in more than 30 years of transformation. When we liberated ourselves from the Soviet Union, we were in shambles. Our economy was down completely, and people were very poor. But now we have graduated into a developed economy. We are considered a high-income country. So I think we've come a very long way. And what I see is Nepal is going a similar way. Nepal started slightly later, and the country is much bigger, with ten times Lithuania’s population. So challenges are, of course, more. And I think education is a big challenge. As we have done this transformation, we continue on digitalisation and on so many modernisation paths. This is the area we can help in advising and guiding because we just did it ourselves and we know how it works. I have been meeting a number of ministers to see which areas the Lithuanian expertise and experience could be best applied in the context of Nepal. So that's a new chapter that I want to open. You met Rekha Sharma, the minister for Communication, Information, and Technology. Can you share what issues were discussed?Since Lithuania ranks sixth in terms of cybersecurity globally, this is one area specifically where our expertise and knowledge could be very applicable, as Nepal has adopted a cybersecurity strategy and guidelines and is embarking on creating the National Cybersecurity Center. We have many companies which work in that area providing services to many others. For instance, the National Cybersecurity Center in Bhutan and the National Institution in Charge of Cybersecurity in Bangladesh were designed by a Lithuanian company. So we think that is what works well in this context. We would be happy to assist Nepal in the cybersecurity area. We could bring a group of experts to advise and guide Nepal. Exports and imports between Nepal and Lithuania have been declining. What should be done to boost bilateral trade between the two small nations for mutual benefit? The trade volumes are up and down and fluctuate year-on-year and this happens with many other countries. During Covid, we exported pharmaceutical agents for vaccines and the trade went up. But later, it declined because there was no need for it. So what we are trying to build now is high-tech cooperation which means the exchange of technology and services. This is one of the sectors which Nepal and Lithuania can exchange in future. We will never measure our relationship in conventional trade as the distance between the two countries is far. Also, nowadays, many producers who used to export have relocated to other regions and are producing in another country, thus changing the export origin, but the product remains Lithuanian. But of course, we need to work and check how our ICT sectors can work together. It's mostly private businesses. But as I said, as a very small but very dynamic government, we also have government-to-government proposals and solutions. So that's why I'm meeting in the ministry and trying to see the needs. We have a super strong laser industry. For decades, we have developed very good laser bays. The screens of an iPhone are cut by using a Lithuanian laser because we supply those laser cutting technologies to iPhone manufacturers—10 percent of the world's scientific lasers are from Lithuania. Our biometrics, which is part of a robotics system, companies have been working around the world and in South Asia helping to verify digital identities like those on voter lists or other registers. In India, the Aadhaar system has a tiny bit of Lithuanian technology used in it. So, we will always have a niche role, but whenever this expertise is needed, then we can really provide it.A small number of tourists visit Nepal from Lithuania. How can Nepal attract tourists from Lithuania?I have visited Nepal as a tourist twice, long ago and I think all of my friends have been to Nepal. We are a very small country and will always be small if you compare it to a much bigger country. Nevertheless, to attract tourists, there is a need to advertise a little more as I think Nepal has excellent things to offer for a reasonable price which is also very important. For now, I can see that almost every Lithuanian can afford a trip to Nepal. The Nepali embassy and travel agencies could also do a little more advertising. I, as a friend of Nepal, am very happy to say and testify to anyone who asks that it's a great country to visit. Be it cultural and religious tourism, mountain trekking, spa, or wellness, I think Nepal has everything. It's easy to reach because connectivity is really good. And it's easy to stay and enjoy as the country is not so super expensive, it's affordable. So what kinds of products are in demand in Nepal and Lithuania? I think from Lithuania it would be electronic devices, digital devices which are needed now in everyday manufacturing processes. For instance, in telematics, any production line with many vehicles or equipment must monitor how they all work. This is where Lithuania is again pioneering. We have 30 percent of India's market in the hardware of telematics. So a Lithuanian company is successfully working in India. It will be IT applications or IT-enabling hardware solutions that we are very good at. From Nepal I think lots of traditional exports could also be interesting as our way of thinking and understanding of fashion and interior is quite similar. For instance, we are a wooden culture. So for us, the idea of a cosy house is wood and textiles, which Nepal produces, which has an excellent market in Lithuania. But in the future, I think, with technologies, ecological farming products will be in demand as the population becomes aware of health and sustainability requirements and not just requirements but use for own consumption. So that's where anything that is ecological and sustainable gets traction, and that's a high-value thing already. It's not a simple potato or tomato, but it's made of ecologically grown products. So how can Nepal and Lithuania work together for mutual benefit? We are here to learn about the changes in Nepal, about the future needs, and about the areas where we are good. We are also here to exchange opinions on issues of global concern, like climate change, which has highly affected both Nepal and Lithuania. None of our countries are great polluters. We, too, are a very minor polluter, much below our obligations, in fact. So how small countries can be together to make sure that the world is really against further global warming is important. Further, I also stress to the Nepal government that we are very grateful for a very principled stance of Nepal vis-a-vis the Russian war against Ukraine. It's a war which is just next door, it's 500 kilometres from my home. Nepal, on a number of occasions, voted in the United Nations to say no to aggression. So I think we are also very grateful and appreciative. Also, we have this unique connection that I wanted to tell, which is a tiny, small, quaint language which was preserved in villages of our country as a very antique, ancient language that is very close to Sanskrit. Since Lithuanian is considered the closest living language, a sister language of Sanskrit. We have started this collaboration with academic institutions here, and Raghunath Adhikari from the Tribhuvan University defended his dissertation on the issue of linguistic similarities last year. And he is the first PhD in Asia to actually do this. So we are happy that we have this connection and he has become a friend of Lithuania. Through him we know about what is happening at the university. Tribhuvan University already has a Memorandum of Understanding with Vilnius University, which is our oldest and main university. So academic collaboration is also very important because there are people working also on technologies, and know-how, which ultimately lead to business cooperation.  \nThe 12th Kantipur Half Marathon, featuring men's/women's half marathon, corporate, college, and wheelchair races with cash prizes and gift hampers, is scheduled for May 18 with an expected participation of over 3,000 runners.\nRishi Amatya's debut novel \"Radha: Wrath of the Maeju,\" featuring a former Royal Kumari battling demonic forces during an earthquake, explores themes of mythology, culture, and the struggles of young writers.\nThe Barbara Foundation on Thursday conferred four journalists with the Barbara Foundation Investigative Journalism Award 2024 for exposing various issues of corruption and abuse of authority through their reportings.Journalists Devendra Bhattarai and Matrika Dahal were awarded the first prize for their in-depth reporting on the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. The revelation led to the arrest of senior leaders, including former ministers Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and Bal Krishna Khand, and high-ranking officials among others for their alleged involvement in the scam.The duo jointly bagged the prize for their investigative journalism and follow-up reporting on the scandal. They received a purse of Rs1.6 million.

While some areas in the new map, especially the Kalapani region, were already a subject of dispute between the two countries, the communist government under Khadga Prasad Oli used its two-third parliamentary majority to include areas as far as Limpiyadhura unilaterally. For those who care to look at historical evidence, Nepal had never asserted its claim over Limpiyadhura, which was a territory lost after the Sugauli treaty of 1816. It was only in context to the existing dispute over the origin of the Kali river, which forms an international boundary in the treaty, that Nepal has claimed the Kalapani region and Lipulekh as its territory. India is cognisant of Nepal’s claim, and there is a joint committee looking at these boundary claims, with dialogue also happening at the Foreign Ministry level.Oli’s move in 2020 was not sudden. He had advisors who clearly understood that Nepal did not fulfil the prerequisites for a sovereign claim over most of those territories under the international law, which mandates physical control of the territory with a resident population under active governance. In fact, the only claim that merits a mention, and which Nepal has strongly put across to India, is the credible evidence regarding Nepal governing the villages in the Kalapani region until a few decades back. Specifications of the evidence aside, what is clear is Nepal’s claims in the Kalapani region have been acknowledged by India and well-documented by the joint committee.Oli’s come-back politicsWhen Oli came to power after the 2017 elections, he was riding on the wave of hyper-nationalism he had managed to stoke in the aftermath of the 2015 Indian blockade. While the Madhesh-based parties had indeed initiated the border obstruction to pressure Kathmandu’s political centre into conceding to their demands on the new constitution, the Narendra Modi government that had just come to power in New Delhi was blamed for actively enforcing the blockade. This is a claim India continues to deny. Whatever the truth, the blockade provided an opportune moment for Oli, whose political career was ailing at the time. He not only managed to sideline his bête noire, Madhav Kumar Nepal, inside the party but he also struck a deal with politically insecure Pushpa Kamal Dahal to cobble up a two-thirds majority in the 2017 elections. What happened next has continued to haunt Nepal’s relationship with India. Oli, of all the communist leaders of his generation, best understands that if there is one issue that could mobilise the population across the country, it is our collective sense of insecurity against what we perceive to be India’s over-reach and micro-management of Nepali politics. An average Nepali consumes Indian products, watches Bollywood movies, and supports an IPL team, all the while disdaining what they consider Indian interference in Nepali affairs.To be fair, such a mindset is not uncommon in a relationship between two countries that are disproportionate in geography, demography, economy or military capability. The tendency of the political class to weaponise public sentiments and insecurity against a larger neighbour for domestic electoral politics is not uncommon either. Autocratic and populist regimes across the world have consolidated their hold over power by stoking hate or fear against a perceived enemy state, painting their domestic opposition as weak and incapable of defending national interests. The definition of the enemy state and the national interests, in such cases, are often dictated by those in power to suit their divisive politics.When Oli refused to concede party or government leadership, Pushpa Kamal Dahal wrecked the mighty two-thirds government with the help of the disgruntled Madhav Kumar Nepal faction. Nepali Congress had no issues cashing in on this division, allowing the party’s president, Sher Bahadur Deuba, to become the Prime Minister in July 2021. Upon becoming premier, Deuba and his coalition partner Dahal did all they could to normalise the relationship with New Delhi. There was little talk about the controversial map or the Eminent Persons’ Group (EPG) report, which had both become irritants in the bilateral relationship. After the 2022 elections, when Dahal became prime minister, New Delhi reciprocated by supporting Nepal’s ambitions to invest in large infrastructures and export power in the Indian market and potentially to Bangladesh. In doing so, New Delhi expected to regain some of the trust it had lost after the 2015 blockade. But Oli is a seasoned politician, a political maverick who can see two steps ahead of his competitors. He sensed Dahal’s distrust of his coalition partners, his personal anxieties and insecurity about the future of his party, which he felt was dealt an under-hand during the division of electoral seats. China, which had openly helped in cobbling up the previous left unity, has been more cautious this time. But there is plenty to read between frequent delegations shuttling between Kathmandu and Beijing over the past year. In any case, Oli convinced Dahal to leave the Nepali Congress coalition and continue in power with UML’s support, with a vague promise of a long-term (electoral) partnership. Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajwadi Party and the newly established Rastriya Swatantra Party were offered attractive cabinet positions in exchange for their support as well. Yadav, though, has left the coalition after the split of his party. Perilous brinkmanship If Pushpa Kamal Dahal believes that the UML chairman took all the trouble of bringing down the NC-led coalition just to watch the game from the sidelines, he needs to change his advisors. He may have generously allowed Dahal to continue on the throne, but it is clear who is setting the rules of the game. The recent decision by the current government to include Nepal’s new map in its currency note has Oli’s footprints all over it. However, his brinkmanship with India could have serious ramifications for the country. Not only will such misadventures jeopardise Nepal’s crucial economic interests, especially in the cross-border energy market where the private sector has invested billions of dollars, our ambition to access the trade route to Bangladesh and further east will not see the light of the day.As the war in Ukraine drags on and the conflict in Gaza worsens, Washington is already zooming out from the Indo-Pacific region. This could provide a much-needed conducive environment for a rapprochement between New Delhi and Beijing, something Indian Prime Minister Modi has hinted at recently. Nepali communists must read the changing geopolitical horizon and understand the days of playing one neighbour against the other may not last for long. Nepal is better off drawing complementarities in its relationship with the two neighbours, allowing them to compete for economic interests on its own terms.  \nElectricity as a clean, affordable and eco-friendly energy source is vital in Nepal. This is because indoor air pollution caused by contaminating fuels—used by 50 percent of Nepal’s population—leads to about 24,000 deaths yearly. Using electrical energy instead of inefficient wood and fossil fuels significantly curbs health risks such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory infection (ARI), lung cancer and even death. The second-most used cooking fuel is liquefied petroleum gas, but high foreign currency reserves are being invested in its imports. Switching to e-cooking can be a much-needed boost to expand the current underwhelming domestic electricity consumption and transition towards cleaner and more productive energy use.Last year, the Government of Nepal reported an over 30 percent surge in e-cooktop imports compared to the preceding year. From an economic perspective, a shift towards environment-friendly cooking is a well-timed alternative for reducing trade deficits from LPG gas imports. The foreign currency reserves thus saved could be channelled towards more productive sectors contributing to national development.One essential convener to e-cooking demands can be attributed to the government’s strategies to ensure energy access and equip each household with clean cooking devices by 2030 through national and international goals and commitments. These include the 15th five-year plan, the second Nationally Determined Contribution submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, and the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All). This is to achieve NetZero goals supported by I/NGOs, the private sector, civil society groups and others. But there is still a long way to go. The 15th Five-Year Plan endorsed by the Government of Nepal expected 100 percent of the Nepali population to have access to electricity by 2023-24. In 2021, we reached almost 92 percent, but even today, only 0.5 percent use electricity as a primary cooking fuel. A smooth and uninterrupted electricity supply is key to sustaining this momentum and encouraging a wider uptake of electric stoves nationwide. The urban population, with better purchasing capacities, benefits as early adopters, while for the rural population, affordability is a constraint in addition to irregular supply and unreliable electricity distribution systems. The next group of adopters with the most potential (the early majority) resides in the semi-urban areas that require sensitisation through behavioural change and communication in addition to regular electricity supply and upgraded distribution systems. An innovative market-led approach that sufficiently addresses the awareness, access, affordability and investment issues can accelerate adoption among early and late majority groups. Some considerations need to be taken in the 16th Five-Year Plan. Availability of standard e-cooktops, along with efficient electricity distribution systems, revised e-tariffs, incentives and e-cooking promotional programmes, can help leapfrog towards achieving SDG 7: Universal access to clean and affordable energy with NetZero targets.Currently, distribution systems managed by the National Electricity Authority (NEA) and the Community Rural Electrification Entities (CREEs) do not meet compliance standards, especially in remote areas. A robust makeover of the electricity distribution system is necessary to increase the number of e-cooking adopters and promote sustained use at the household level. Local government, NEA subsidiary, and CREE must work together to support e-cooking adoption at the local level by speeding up the system upgrade provisioned by Community Electrification bylaws.The existing progressive e-tariff is a menace to the sustained use of e-cooking devices: The free minimum consumption for lower-end users/consumers usually demotivates continuous use beyond the free limit of 20 units for rural customers. Reconsideration of e-tariffs that motivate the use of essential gadgets such as e-cooking devices is necessary if we hope to target peripheral consumers. Governments at all levels should consider a holistic approach while designing and implementing electric cooking promotional programmes in close coordination with related stakeholders and vice versa. Therefore, complementing each other’s work and minimising duplication must be prioritised. Authorities should ensure an enabling environment with necessary policies and pragmatic guidelines to support the e-cooking transition—for instance, tax exemption of e-cooking appliances, promotion of local manufacturing of e-cooking devices, etc.The systematic implementation of incentive provisions is essential in promoting a sustainable market for e-cooking. Failing to achieve uniformity and random selection of incentive recipients would only create situations where the real, needful population don’t receive them. Incentives and subsidies must be planned to ensure a participatory market system development of e-cooking products. Need-based incentivisation is essential to ensure the subsidies reach the needy category of the population.Developing and contextualising standards and regulating them for effective implementation can foster confidence in transitioning to e-cooking. This can support the circular economy by importing only standardised products. Moreover, cooking fuel and technology choices depend on accessibility, demographic, and socio-economic factors. Promoting manufacturing within the country can further ensure the cost-effectiveness of the transition. Creating awareness about the cost-effectiveness and safety protocols while using e-cooktops, ensuring after-sales services, and swiftly responding to related queries are necessary interventions to propagate e-cooking adopters and ensure sustained use. This is most effective when the target community participates in the process. While the majority of the population in the country is still dependent on traditional inefficient biomass, switching to cleaner fuels like electricity can form a basis for attaining sustainable development. The conducive environments created by our commitments through SDG7 and our country-specific report NDC II to UNFCCC in attaining NetZero goals have been instrumental so far. Now, we need to strengthen our two major enablers- the adequate and reliable electricity supply and well-functioning e-cooking appliance supply systems to pave the path towards transition to e-cooking in Nepal.  \nAfter a months-long heatwave, the recent rainfall in Nepal brought much-needed relief and helped put out wildfires. Unfortunately, the rainwater, coupled with warmth, also created a favourable environment for dengue-carrying mosquitoes. As a result, dengue cases are already on the rise, with 57 districts reporting dengue infection, and over 50 cases were reported in a single week. Experts believe the worst is yet to come. Even though dengue has taken many lives in the past few years (20 deaths in 2023, 88 in 2022 and six in 2019) and infected many (52,000 in 2023, 54,000 in 2022 and 16,000 in 2019), it remains the most neglected virus. Authorities seem to care little either about its spread or severity. Nor do they try to understand the changing nature of the virus from climate change and rising temperatures through research and tests. A Dengue Action Plan is in place, but the government hasn’t been able to do enough to contain the spread of the virus except relying on traditional methods like surveillance of the virus, serotyping of the dengue-carrying mosquitoes, plus treatment, management and collaboration with local levels. Even the action plan acknowledges that the country’s dengue spread has gone out of hand, making it difficult to contain. Nepal is unable to undertake year-round surveillance and prevention programmes due to budgetary limits. The action plan clearly states that there’s no budget to deal with dengue throughout the year. This was bound to happen as the health ministry’s budget was reduced this fiscal year, discontinuing many programmes. Moreover, even the budget allocated for a particular fiscal year (for example in 2022-23) is used up before March/April, when cases usually surge. These months, as experts suggest, are crucial, as stopping the spread of the virus just when the cases are rising is the most effective way to cut down on the number of deaths and infections throughout the year. Apart from insufficient budget, the country also lacks entomologists, and no other ministry is held responsible for the work except health.The situation will only worsen the longer these challenges are overlooked. And removing the dengue menace should not be the sole responsibility of the health ministry. The finance ministry should allocate enough budget to drive dengue prevention measures for a whole year; the environment ministry can implement environmental policies to control the breeding sites of mosquitoes, and urge people to maintain sanitation and proper waste management; the urban development ministry must manage drainage systems and green spaces; while the transportation ministry needs to prevent the accumulation of stagnant water on roads. Only such a collective measure will help reduce dengue dangers.While continuing with awareness programmes, door-to-door campaigns and search-find-destroy drives should also be pushed on a regular basis. There is a strong case for learning from other countries. For instance, eDengue systems implemented in Malaysia could be used to report cases from rural parts of Nepal and detect severe cases for timely medical intervention. The onus is also on the public to take preventive measures on a year-round basis. Again, dengue is not something that only the government can control. If we don’t work together, many of us will needlessly suffer.  \nIndia captain Sunil Chhetri, the country’s most prolific footballer, will retire from international football after the World Cup qualifier against Kuwait on June 6, the 39-year-old announced on Thursday.Chhetri has been the face of Indian football for nearly a decade-and-half and his 94 international goals make him the third-highest active international goalscorer after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.“It was not that I was feeling tired,” Chhetri said in a video he posted on social media.“When the instinct came this should be my last game, I thought about it a lot and eventually I came to this decision.”“Will I be sad after this? Of course...the kid inside me never wants to stop if given a chance to play for his country.”“It’s time for our country to see the next number nine.”Chhetri is also India’s most-capped player having played 150 international matches since his debut against Pakistan in 2005.“Your legacy on and off-the-field will always be remembered,” the All India Football Federation (AIFF) said in a post on X.“Thank you @chetrisunil11 for your leadership, dedication and commitment to Indian football.” \nBritain’s food watchdog has applied extra control measures on all spice imports from India, it said on Wednesday, becoming the first to ramp up scrutiny of all Indian spices after contamination allegations against two brands sparked concerns among global food regulators.Hong Kong last month suspended sales of three spice blends produced by MDH and one by Everest, saying they contained high levels of a cancer-causing pesticide ethylene oxide.Singapore also ordered a recall of the Everest mix, and New Zealand, the United States, India and Australia have since said they are looking into issues related to the two brands.MDH and Everest—two of India’s most popular brands—have said their products are safe for consumption.In the most stringent crackdown so far impacting all Indian spices, the UK’s Food Standards Agency (FSA) said that in light of the concerns it has “applied extra control measures for pesticide residues in spices from India which includes ethylene oxide”.The agency did not elaborate on the exact steps it is taking.“The use of ethylene oxide is not allowed here and maximum residue levels are in place for herbs and spices,” James Cooper, Deputy Director of Food Policy at the FSA, said in a statement to Reuters.India’s Spices Board, which regulates exports, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. India is the biggest exporter, consumer and producer of spices in the world.In 2022 Britain imported $128 million worth of spices, with India accounting for almost $23 million, data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity website shows.MDH and Everest export their products to many regions including the US, Europe, South East Asia, Middle East and Australia.Indian regulators have also conducted testing of all spice products and inspected samples of MDH and Everest products, though no results have been made public so far.MDH has since 2021 seen an average 14.5 percent of its US shipments rejected over the presence of bacteria salmonella, a Reuters analysis of US FDA data has found.On Wednesday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency told Reuters in a statement it was aware of the concerns around MDH and Everest’s products and “continues to monitor the situation”.“Based on current information, we have no evidence to suggest that the issues raised affect products currently in the Canadian market,” it said. \nAn AI video shows an ecstatic Narendra Modi sporting a trendy jacket and trousers, grooving on a stage to a Bollywood song as the crowd cheers. The Indian prime minister reshared the video on X, saying “such creativity in peak poll season is truly a delight.”Another video, with the same stage setting, shows Modi’s rival Mamata Banerjee dancing in a saree-like outfit, but the background score is parts of her speech criticizing those who quit her party to join Modi’s. State police have launched an investigation saying the video can “affect law and order.”The different reactions to videos created using artificial intelligence (AI) tools underscore how the use and abuse of the technology is increasing and creating worries for regulators and security officials as the world's most populous nation holds a mammoth general election.Easy to make AI videos, which contain near-perfect shadow and hand movements, can at times mislead even digitally-literate people. But risks are higher in a country where many of the 1.4 billion people are tech challenged and where manipulated content can easily stir sectarian tensions, especially at election time.According to a World Economic Forum survey published in January, the risk to India from misinformation is seen higher than the risk from infectious diseases or illicit economic activity in the next two years.“India is already at a great risk of misinformation - with AI in picture, it can spread at the speed of 100X,” said New Delhi-based consultant Sagar Vishnoi, who is advising some political parties on AI use in India's election.“Elderly people, often not a tech savvy group, increasingly fall for fake narratives aided by AI videos. This could have serious consequences like triggering hatred against a community, caste or religion.”The 2024 national election – being held over six weeks and ending on June 1 – is the first in which AI is being deployed. Initial examples were innocent, restricted to some politicians using the technology to create videos and audio to personalize their campaigns.India’s Election Commission last week warned political parties against AI use to spread misinformation and shared seven provisions of information technology and other laws that attract jail terms of up to three years for offences including forgery, promoting rumours and enmity.A senior national security official in New Delhi said authorities are concerned about the possibility of fake news leading to unrest. The easy availability of AI tools makes it possible to manufacture such fake news, especially during elections, and it's difficult to counter, the official said.“We don’t have an (adequate monitoring) capacity...the ever evolving AI environment is difficult to keep track of,” said the official.A senior election official said: “We aren’t able to fully monitor social media, forget about controlling content.”They declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to media.AI and deepfakes are being increasingly used in elections elsewhere in the world, including in US, Pakistan and Indonesia. The latest spread of the videos in India shows the challenges faced by authorities.For years, an Indian IT ministry panel has been in place to order blocking of content that it feels can harm public order, at its own discretion or on receiving complaints. While Mod’s reaction to his AI dancing video - “I also enjoyed seeing myself dance” - was light hearted, the Kolkata city police in West Bengal state launched an investigation against X user, SoldierSaffron7, for sharing the Banerjee video.Kolkata cyber crime officer, Dulal Saha Roy, shared a typed notice on X asking the user to delete the video or “be liable for strict penal action.”“I am not deleting that, no matter what happens,” the user told Reuters via X direct messaging, declining to share their number or real name as they feared police action. “They can’t trace (me).”Election officers told Reuters authorities can only tell social media platforms to remove content and are left scrambling if the platforms say the posts don't violate their internal policies.The Modi and Banerjee dancing videos, with 30 million and 1.1 million views respectively on X, were created using a free website, Viggle. The site allows a photograph and a few basic prompts that are detailed in a tutorial to generate videos within minutes that show the person in the photograph dancing or making other real-life moves.Viggle co-founder Hang Chu and Banerjee’s office did not respond to Reuters queries.Other than the two dancing AI videos, one other 25-second Viggle video spreading online shows Banerjee appear in front of a burning hospital and blowing it up using a remote. It's an AI altered clip of a scene from the 2008 movie, The Dark Knight, that shows Batman's foe, Joker, wreaking havoc.The video post has 420,000 views.The West Bengal police believes it violates Indian IT laws, but X has not taken any action as it “strongly believes in defending and respecting the voice of our users”, according to an email notice sent by X to the user, which Reuters reviewed.“They can’t do anything to me. I didn't take that (notice) seriously,” the user told Reuters via X direct messaging. \nElectoral reform is the latest flashpoint in a decades-long tussle over France’s role in the mineral-rich island, which lies in the southwest Pacific, some 1,500 km (930 miles) east of Australia.New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters called for all sides to de-escalate a situation that was “of serious concern across the Pacific Islands region”.Vanuatu’s prime minister, Charlot Salwai, chairman of the Melanesian Spearhead Group, which also includes Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, said the indiscriminate destruction of property would affect New Caledonia’s economy in a big way and have a cascading effect on the lives of all New Caledonians, including Kanaks.France should establish dialogue with FLNKS, which has condemned the violence, and annul the constitutional reform that sparked the crisis, he said.“These events could have been avoided if the French government had listened,” he added.Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong in parliament called for calm and said Australia supported discussions between all parties.More than 200 people have been arrested, and 64 gendarmes and police injured, while road barricades put up by the protesters were causing a “dire situation” for medicine and food for the population, Le Franc said in a televised news conference.Main and secondary roads in Noumea were blocked by barricades with burning cars and car carcasses, some with booby traps, he said.“I am calling on those at the head of the CCAT to stop these actions, which are murderous, deadly actions that can leave families in mourning,” he said of the traps.There were also confrontations overnight between CCAT members and self-defence groups who are also in breach of the curfew and a weapons ban, he said.Noumea resident Yoan Fleurot told Reuters in a video interview that he has seen looting and destruction of property. Some storeowners willingly let their shelves be raided, pleading that their shops not be destroyed, he said.Fleurot said he is armed with a firearm and has video surveillance installed around his house, adding he has only ventured out in daylight to check on his parents or his properties.“Caledonia will have a hard time recovering from this crisis... Everything, 80%, is destroyed,” he added. \nShreeya Giri, 28, has been named to Forbes’ 30 Under 30 List, which includes 300 young entrepreneurs, leaders, and trailblazers from across the Asia-Pacific region.Giri, who is the founder of Nepali digital mental health platform Happy Minds, was listed by the prestigious magazine under the social impact category.Happy Minds, Giri’s brainchild, is a Nepali digital mental health platform that offers individual online and face-to-face counselling, as well as group workshops. The platform’s innovative approach and impact were recognised when it was named the best newcomer from Nepal at the 2022 South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Startup Awards.Forbes on Thursday announced the ninth edition of its ‘30 Under 30 Asia’ list. They were listed under ten categories— the arts (art and style, food and drink); entertainment and sports; finance and venture capital; media, marketing and advertising; retail and e-commerce; enterprise technology; industry, manufacturing and energy; healthcare and science; social impact and consumer technology.Other notable persons from Asia featured in the 2024 list include the K-pop girl band Ive, Singaporean track and field athlete Veronica Shanti Pereira, Japan’s youngest mayor, Ryosuke Takashima of Ashiya City, and many others.Forbes said the 2024 list features a diverse set of 30 Under 30 listees, with 21 countries and territories represented across the Asia-Pacific region. India had the most with 86 entries, followed by China and Japan (32 each), Singapore (27), Australia (26) and Indonesia (18). \nFormer Nepal Army chief Dharmapaal Barsingh Thapa died on Thursday morning.Thapa was admitted to the Chhauni-based Nepal Army Hospital two days ago following health complications, where he died while undergoing treatment, according to the Nepal Army.Thapa was the chief of Army Staff from 1995 to 1999. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nPolitical engagement of Nepali teachers and students has become a highly debated subject recently. Ironically, people who run political parties and governments in a multiparty system have raised this topic on different occasions. Lately, the well-meaning, young and intelligent Education Minister Sumana Shrestha has cast ripples by proposing to strictly bar teachers from directly engaging in political activities and holding their jobs at educational institutions simultaneously. Political leaders and government ministers have put forward ambivalent proposals to keep academic institutions and pedagogy free from party activism. Educational institutions became highly politicised after the fall of the Panchayat. But to borrow from the English poet TS Eliot’s poem “Gerontion”, Nepali history has many “passages, contrived corridors”. The political engagements of the students during the Panchayat regime influenced the activities of teachers’ unions. Teachers’ allegiances to political parties and proactive engagements have begun to be treated as an important public sphere. The public sphere of education became the bastion of such political activities. Some discussion about that is in order.The parties banned from openly working during the Panchayat era found the students and their organisations the most effective sources of spreading their ideas in society. The students had all the necessary accoutrements for running an organisation like holding free elections by upholding free multiparty ideas. The students’ unions were shaped in a multiparty pattern. The political leaders that held sway during that period found these unions the most useful tools for spreading their ideas. The students had unions, free forums, occasional seminars and multiparty contestations. They were broadly divided between what became familiar as binary in Nepali politics, the Nepali Congress and the Nepal Communist Party. Apart from a few organisations that followed the binary espoused by the students, the teachers had weak functioning, open party-oriented organisations. The teachers engaged in creating unions in the multiparty order towards the last days of the Panchayat rule.The political parties realised that the best forums to promote or propagate multiparty ideas were those of the students and, in some cases, the teachers’ unions. That practice was hegemonised after the fall of the Panchayat. It became so accepted a norm of the hegemony, as defined by the Italian thinker Antonio Gramsci, that nobody questioned the effectiveness and validity of the political organisations of students and teachers; they became a subject of acceptance. They worked hand in glove with these organisations. Parties even used them as hugely useful propaganda machinery. This hegemony almost wrecked educational institutions when politically proactive teachers openly worked for the political parties. The students, too, started working openly for the parties. After 1996, the practice continued under a different condition. The students who followed the Maoist party line became militant, and several went underground. Some teachers were sympathetic to the Maoists and worked for them. Such is the genesis of the influence of politics in educational institutions in Nepal. My experience says it is important to look at the students' political inclinations by placing them in a historical order. I want to put forth some visceral narratives.Recalling my student days today as a professor emeritus is revealing for two reasons. One, the debate about the political activism of teachers and students has occupied the minds of politicians and educationists today. Two, this debate has a long history and legacy. It started when King Mahendra dissolved the people's elected parliament in 1960 and introduced the Panchayat system.It was in the early days of the Panchayat that I joined colleges. First, I enrolled in the Intermediate of Arts at Morang College, Biratnagar, after the School Leaving Certificate. At that time, students found it convenient to form unions along party lines. As a college student, my problem, like those of my contemporaries, was to work with a double consciousness that involved balancing my studies with my political activism, which was not an easy task but an exciting experience. When I joined the Bachelor of Arts at Mahendra College of Dharan, I became politically active and got elected as general secretary of the left-oriented student union. Out of the union, we created a small cohort of Trotskyites involving little over a dozen of us. We even fled to India, crossing the thick charkose forest on foot, and got badly beaten up and detained after we returned. However, even in those circumstances, I continued my studies and did well in the final examination. But I maintained what I would like to call the double bind the whole time. Importantly, during our political activism, we did not meet any political leaders. I was influenced by the writings of BP Koirala, Pushpalal Shrestha and Manmohan Adhikari, but I met none of them. That was the pattern of student political activism. It is entirely wrong to say that students who espoused multiparty ideas always followed the instructions of political leaders. When I came to Kathmandu to study the Master of Arts in English, I realised that my double bind entered a new phase. I came to the capital with a blank mind after my political leanings were gone. The strange visitors mostly from the West who came to Kathmandu began to fill the blank of my mind. They were known as hippies. That is a different story. I also became the culture secretary at Kirtipur Union. Today, when we are talking about keeping the institutions free from political activism, we should treat students' aspirations in politics as something different from those of the teachers. I support the minister's efforts to keep educational institutions from becoming the bastions of political parties. I acknowledge that the students and some of their unions have been playing as tools of the political parties and have crossed the limits of the educational norms once in a while. Students whom I have known as colleagues and as teachers for over half a century have a great history of fighting for freedom and academic accomplishments. Students should keep up that great tradition. Teachers, the custodians of education, should stop becoming the cadres of political parties. The political parties and organisations will do great harm to education if they continue to work with the old temptation of using students and teachers for their politics. We are acting at a time when the double binds of students and teachers need to be prudently and creatively used.     \nClimate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, according to the latest survey report.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, was released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics. It paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say worse is yet to come.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades. Major economic sectors and essential services like health and education in Nepal have felt the repercussions of extreme weather events linked to climate change, the survey said.The statistics office said the sampling used the total number of households from the population census. In total, 6.66 million individual households were included in the frame. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from July to March 2023 among 6,508 households in 326 primary sampling units, encompassing all seven provinces. The statistics office said all the respondents were at least 45 years old and had lived in the survey area for 25 years, forming the sampling frame that included households meeting these criteria across Nepal.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Nepal’s agriculture sector is the mainstay of the country’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of the population. The sector is mainly rainfed and heavily dependent on rainfall.When the rain fails to fall, the GDP takes a tumble. This dependence makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain region (68.7 percent), hill region (50.3 percent), and Tarai region (46.3 percent) also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases. The survey report shows households in altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 metres reported emergingnew crop diseases (60.2 percent) over the last 25 years. This shows diverse factors influence the prevalence of crop diseases across diverse geographical and climatic domains.“The situation is alarming,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office.“The survey was intended to see people’s perception towards climate change, the most burning issue globally,” he said. Climate change literacy among people, mostly in rural areas, is shallow, but some exciting facts exist. “Most of the farmers surveyed are not clear whether climate change is bringing diseases and low yields, but at the same time, they have a coping mechanism knowingly or unknowingly,” said Regmi. For instance, farmers have changed the cropping pattern. “If they think rainfall will be below normal or drought, they switch to another crop.”The survey shows that 35.8 percent of the households surveyed were aware of climate change. Across all three geographical domains, the number of households unaware of climate change is significantly high, with the highest number being in the mountain region (70.9 percent). The sex-disaggregated data indicate that most male (61.3 precent) and female (74 percent) respondents were unaware of climate change impacts.The accessibility of early warning information among the people is weak.In urban municipalities, 16.3 percent of households received early-warning information, while 83.7 percent of the respondents did not receive any information regarding a disaster occurring shortly. Altitude-wise, households in low-altitude regions have received more early-warning information than those in the higher-altitude areas. The survey results show a significant impact of climate change on Nepal's water resources over the last 25 years. Climate change has notable implications for the country's energy transition, as it is actively pursuing a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources. According to experts, the survey report is eye-opening. Nepal plans to generate 30,000MW of electricity by 2035, and the market for Nepal's hydropower is opening up in India and Bangladesh.Many households reported adverse changes and noted their water resources dried up. This phenomenon was observed across all domains and indicates a nationwide decrease in water availability. Respondents experienced a reduction in ground and surface water, primarily attributed to insufficient rainfall and increased drought incidents. According to the survey, 78.3 percent of households observed a decline in rivulets and streams, and 55 percent observed a decrease in wells, springs, and stone spouts. Likewise, 47.7 percent observed changes in water resources due to insufficient rainfall, followed by an increase in drought (20.3 percent), road construction (3.4 percent), deforestation and urbanisation (3.2 percent). In contrast, minimal respondents observed change due to population growth, earthquakes and landslides/soil erosion over the last 25 years.The survey said that over the past 25 years, Nepal has suffered from various natural disasters. Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.  \nThe victory of Suhang Nembang, a political neophyte representing the CPN-UML, in Ilam-2 by-election may not have a big impact on the make-up of the federal parliament. But it nevertheless hints at the country’s general political landscape and, of course, of the Koshi Province, where identity politics had been all the rage in the lead-up to the election.The nomenclature of Koshi Province, of which Ilam is a district, had been a flashpoint of violent agitation led by the proponents of identity politics who wanted a name that reflected the ethnic identity of the place. Two activists from that front—Milan Limbu, representing the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and independent Dakendra Singh Limbu, who was part of the Province-1 Renaming Joint Struggle Committee—were in the fray. So there was curiosity on how they would perform. While the latter came in third with 11,457 votes, the former’s electoral run ended rather dismally as he could not even protect his security deposit.The votes gained by Dakendra has undercut the claims of the major parties that voices for identity-based politics in the region were weakening, argues Govinda Chhantyal, who is among the activists who opposed the nomenclature of Koshi Province.“The number of votes independent candidate Dekendra Singh Limbu garnered in Ilam-2 bypoll has established identity-politics as a major agenda in the region,” Chhantyal told the Post. “Since the 2014 election, the agenda of identity politics has been subjugated. This by-election, however, has once again established it as a political agenda.”The election result has also given the emergent Rastriya Swatantra Party a reality check, experts say. The RSP has a long way to go if it is to establish itself as a major political force throughout the country, they say, as candidates of both the ‘traditional’ political parties, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, trumped all others.The Ilam-2 House of Representatives seat went vacant after former Speaker and vice-chair of UML Subas Chandra Nembang died of a heart attack in September last year.While Suhang, the late leader’s son, won the bypoll securing 27,772 votes, his closest competitor, Dambar Bahadur Khadka, of the Nepali Congress, obtained 21,942 against Dakendra Singh’s 11,457 and Milan Limbu’s 5,050.The result shows the old parties are very much in the fray.“It seems people still see the old parties as relevant given their robust networks at the grassroots, which RSP and independent candidates lacked,” Chiran Manandhar, who was one the observers of Ilam-2 election representing the Democracy Research Center Nepal, told the Post. “People who aspire to political patronage still find old parties relevant.”The RSP had created great buzz with their vigorous campaigning for the Ilam-2 seat. Their candidate Milan Limbu and the independent Dakendra Singh had challenged the traditional parties. Given the past votes obtained by the RSP in the 2022 election and the by-elections in Chitwan-2 and Tanahun-1 a year earlier, the party was expected to challenge the established forces this time, too. But that was not to be.After the poll results, RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane took to social media to thank all the voters and urged his party supporters to accept the outcome. “Thank you everyone who voted for us and also gave us a big message,” he said.Other RSP leaders have said that there were some shortcomings of the party while contesting the Ilam-2 seat, which they would review in the upcoming central committee meeting of the party.“We heeded the signal bell, albeit belatedly,” reads the statement released by party general secretary Mukul Dhakal after the results.The RSP, which emerged as the national political force in the November 2022 election, still has a long way to go before it becomes a major political party that can go toe to toe against the likes of the Congress and the UML, experts say. “It seems the RSP has some currency in the urban areas of the country, but when it comes to the countryside, they still need to work hard to establish a base,” Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political scientist, told the Post.For Bhatta, party president Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the cooperative scam is another reason why RSP could not perform well in Ilam-2.Lamichhane, who is also the deputy prime minister and minister of home affairs, has been accused in the cooperative fund embezzlement cases lodged in Kaski District Court and Rupandehi District Court. Lamichhane has been denying his involvement. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel delivered the government's policies and programmes on Tuesday after the Nepali Congress lifted the obstruction in the House of Representatives. However, the disruption continued afterwards.President Paudel read out the policies and programmes of the government in the joint sitting of the federal parliament.The Congress then blocked the proceedings of both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly and did not let the assembly table a motion of expressing gratitude to the President for delivering the government’s annual paper.It is customary for Parliament to thank the President for reading out the annual policies and programmes. The parliamentary party meeting of the Congress on Tuesday morning, however, had decided not to allow Parliament to proceed after the head of state wraps up his presentation.The Congress later responded that the policies and programmes fail to address the problems of cooperatives’ victims. The main opposition has been protesting in Parliament, demanding a parliamentary probe into the issue of cooperatives around the country embezzling the deposits of hundreds of thousands of depositors. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane is the focus of the largest party’s fury for his alleged involvement in the cooperative scam. “Our position that the government has protected the people who have swindled cooperatives victims has been reconfirmed,” said Ramesh Lekhak, the chief whip of the Congress party, while talking to the media after the policies and programmes had been read out.The main opposition party was initially not ready to allow the smooth operation of the Parliament’s proceedings. The party even warned the government and the ruling partners that it would prevent President Paudel from presenting the government's policies and programmes should its demand go unheeded.The Congress has been disrupting Parliament, demanding a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane over allegations of cooperative funds embezzlement. Lamichhane has publicly refuted the charges and asked for a chance to make his case clear in Parliament.But the Congress has been preventing Lamichhane from speaking in the House. The Congress, which appeared tough against the resumption of parliamentary business, even the presidential appearance, had relented and agreed to let the President present the programmes. But it resorted to the obstruction soon after. In 2017, the CPN-UML, while in the opposition, had been obstructing parliamentary proceedings. It allowed then-President Bidya Devi Bhandari to present the annual policies. The opposition then protested the Cabinet’s decision to increase the number of local federal units in the Tarai in the midst of the elections. The party later obstructed the motion of thanks to the President.During Speaker Devraj Ghimire’s meeting with the party chief whips on Tuesday afternoon, before the President read out the government’s annual document, the Congress had announced its plan to continue to disrupt the House after the policies had been presented.“We will continue to interrupt the House until our demand is addressed,” Congress whip Sushila Thing told the Post. “As there is no parliamentary practice of barring the head of state to present policies and programmes, we too didn’t go that uncharted route.”The party will not allow other proceedings of the two houses for as long as it takes in order to get its demands addressed, Thing said.On Tuesday morning, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa and the party’s Chief Whip Lekhak met Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to discuss the issue of parliamentary obstruction. Dahal had requested the Congress leaders to allow a smooth functioning of the legislature. The Congress leaders also claimed that the prime minister seemed positive about addressing their demand.“While meeting our leaders, the prime minister seemed positive but he has not taken the necessary steps to honour the call of the main opposition,” Congress whip Thing said. Dahal’s openness to the formation of the probe committee was one of the reasons the Congress became ready to allow the President to present the policies and programmes. Shakti Basnet, the minister of energy, water resources and irrigation, claimed that the discussion between the government and Congress was headed in a positive direction.“Until late Monday night, the Congress was adamant on barring the President from presenting the policies and programmes. But on Tuesday, we reached an agreement to allow the President to do so,” Basnet, a Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, told the Post. “The government will similarly reach an agreement with the Congress on its demand for the probe committee.”According to the Congress leaders, Sunday's meeting between the prime minister and Congress leaders also concluded positively to address the party's demand. After the Congress leaders met Prime Minister Dahal, the party held the parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday morning. The same meeting allowed President Paudel to confer the government's annual policies and programmes. The ruling parties and the main opposition have been discussing smooth operation of Parliament for the past few days. However, given the inflexible positions of both sides, Tuesday’s session was expected to face trouble.“The ruling parties and the opposition need to come to a logical conclusion to open the parliamentary business,” UML whip Sunita Baral told the Post. “It looks like both sides only have discussed the issue at their ease. What we need is negotiation to resolve the issues of both Parliament and the cooperative scam.”The constitution mandates the government to present its annual budget on Jestha 15 (May 28 this year). For this reason also, the ruling and opposition parties need to close their ranks, Baral added.The ruling parties are ready to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the issues plaguing the cooperative sector. However, they are reluctant to constitute a committee with the mandate to probe Lamichhane. The Congress, too, is positive about a broad inquiry into the cooperatives, but it deems investigating Lamichhane in particular a necessity after various probes by police and other government bodies established his involvement in the scams. The Congress had disrupted the winter session of Parliament before it was prorogued on April 14, with the same demand. The party has also been obstructing the new session of Parliament that commenced on May 10. \nNepal’s regional political parties that emerged as prominent forces mainly after the political change of popular movement of 2006 have entered into a stage of disputes and divisions.On May 5, Ashok Rai, one of the top leaders of Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), along with some other key leaders, split the party and registered an application for a new party at the Election Commission. The election body registered the Janata Samajbadi Party under Rai’s leadership. Seven of the 12 federal lawmakers of the Yadav-led JSP-Nepal joined the Rai-led party.Yadav on Monday moved the Supreme Court challenging the Election Commission’s decision to register the new party, accusing the body of giving recognition to the Rai-led group as a new political party unconstitutionally. The case is sub-judice in the court.Yadav, who was deputy prime minister and minister for health and population in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government, resigned from his post on Monday. His party pulled out of the government.Later in the evening, Dahal appointed one minister and one minister of state from the newly formed party led by Rai.“With the resignation of our party’s ministers, our party has withdrawn its support to the government,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The JSP-Nepal’s parliamentary party leader Upendra Yadav, writing a letter to Speaker Devraj Ghimire, withdrew the party’s support to the government.On the other hand, the JSP-Nepal, which had been leading the Madhesh government since 2017, has been limited to a minority position after the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support to the provincial government. Yadav’s JSP-Nepal is the only party to get the opportunity to lead a provincial government continuously for seven years. With the UML and Maoist Centre withdrawing their support, it is almost certain to be out of power in the province for the first time in seven years.It is not only the JSP-Nepal that has split. In February, Rajendra Mahato, a key leader of the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), quit the organisation to announce his new campaign, Rastriya Mukti Andolan, literally the ‘National Liberation Movement.’Bijay Kumar Gachchhadar, who led the Madheshi Janaadhikar Forum-Democratic, merged his party with Nepali Congress. Once a powerful leader in national politics, Gachchhadar has now lost his influence in Madhesh as well.Hridayesh Tripathi, a prominent Madheshi leader, formed a separate outfit, the Janata Pragatisheel Party, over two years ago.A senior Maoist leader, Prabhu Sah from the Madhesh, also formed his own Aam Janata Party in December 2022.It is not only the traditional forces but also the emerging ones that are grappling with crises.The Nagarik Unmukti Party (NUP), which emerged mainly from the latest general election, has been embroiled in a factional dispute between party chair Ranjita Shrestha and her husband, Resham Lal Chaudhary. The rift caused the party to lose the opportunity to lead the Sudurpaschim provincial government last month.While Shrestha has joined hands with the Dahal-led ruling coalition, Chaudhary is lobbying to collaborate with Nepali Congress.The regional political forces, which had emerged as a serious challenge for mainstream political forces such as Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, have lost their influence drastically in the recent years, mainly due to intra-party feuds and divisions.“They try to agitate for their rights, but they also indulge in a politics of power, which contrasts with each other,” Tula Narayan Shah, a Madhesh-based political analyst, told the Post. “Probably one of their demands can be mustered through the protest, but the other can only be achieved from the House of Representatives.”Experts think that despite their shortcomings, regional parties’ relevance is still intact. “If the traditional regional parties could not prove their significance, they will be replaced by the new ones,” Lokraj Baral, a political analyst, told the Post. “However, the relevance of regional parties will remain intact.”He said that with the influence of Yadav diminishing in the province, CK Raut of Janamat Party is likely to take his position in the days to come if the latter can prove his credibility.Experts say that regional parties, rather than being driven to address the regional issues for which they were constituted, got diverted from their initial motives and became self-centered, culminating in splits.“When marginalised people constitute the party, those parties are often leader-centric,” Shah told the Post. “Parties where a single leader holds sway are less accommodative and more autocratic. Internal democracy is weak in those parties. As a result, they split.” \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal)’s division is expected to lead the Madhesh provincial government into a crisis. The CPN (Maoist Centre), Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s party that has backed the Madhesh government, was in an internal meeting on Thursday to discuss the prospect of the provincial government, which is led by the JSP-Nepal chaired by Upendra Yadav.On Sunday, Ashok Rai, the federal council chair of the Yadav-led JSP-Nepal, along with six other lawmakers and 30 central committee members, split the party to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. The Election Commission on Monday registered the Rai-led new party.At least two Madhesh assembly leaders of the Maoist Centre the Post spoke to said they are considering forming a new government in the province. “As we are still discussing a change in the provincial government, it would be premature to share the details,” a Maoist Centre provincial lawmaker told the Post on condition of anonymity. “We are taking up the issue with various parties in the provincial assembly.”“With the budget session of the provincial assembly fast approaching, we want to conclude the discussion on the new government before that,” the Maoist Centre provincial assembly member said. The Maoist Centre holds two ministries in the Madhesh government led by Saroj Yadav. Bharat Sah, the parliamentary party leader of the Maoist Centre who took charge of the Ministry of Forests, has not been working, accusing the chief minister of not allowing him to lead the finance ministry as promised at the time of a Cabinet reshuffle on April 16.The Maoist Centre had claimed the government’s leadership in Madhesh after Prime Minister Dahal changed coalition partners at the centre on March 4. But Saroj Kumar Yadav was reappointed the chief minister based on the broad power-sharing deal reached at the centre.On April 16 Saroj Yadav sought a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly for the fourth time after the formation of the provincial government in January last year. In the latest floor test, Yadav secured 61 votes in his favour in the 107-member assembly. Voting for Yadav were provincial assembly members of the Janata Samajbadi Party (19), the CPN-UML (25 including the Speaker who cannot vote), the Maoist Centre (9), the CPN (Unified Socialist) (7) and independent lawmakers. The Nepali Congress (22), the Janamat Party (13) and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (9) sit in the opposition.After Sunday’s party split at the centre, the Upendra Yadav-led faction of the Janata Samajbadi held the provincial parliamentary party meeting on Monday. Of the party’s 19 assembly members, three didn’t attend the meeting, a party leader had told the Post. Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal central spokesperson Manish Suman, who attended the provincial meeting, said, “The split at the central level does not reflect in the provincial meeting as all members except three were present.”Political analysts believe the coalition partners may not accept the Upendra Yadav-led party’s leadership in the provincial government, even though the split at the centre has little bearing on the JSP-Nepal in the province.As the largest party in the provincial assembly, the UML is unlikely to support the leader of the JSP-Nepal, the third-largest party in Janakpur, as chief minister. UML leaders have bitter relations with Madheshi politicians, mainly since 2015, the year the constitution was promulgated. As UML chair KP Sharma Oli was projected as anti-federalist and anti-Madhesh in the province, the UML leaders were even chased away from some districts and barred from holding mass gatherings there.However, in the 2022 elections, the UML emerged as the largest party in the same province.“The Madhesh government is unlikely to keep its current shape,” Chandra Kishore, a Madhesh-based political expert, told the Post. “The resentment against the incumbent government was growing for its poor performance. It would have fallen sooner or later, even if the JSP-Nepal had not split.”He said the UML aspires to lead the provincial government. “The largest party in the assembly may stake its claim to the government leadership this time,” he added.However, Rajendra Prasad Chaudhary Tharu, an assembly member from the UML, argued that the JSP-Nepal of Upendra Yadav is still strong in the province. Though the party has been vertically split at the centre, the splinter group doesn’t have the numbers to change the government in the province, the UML leader said. “However, the provincial power equation will be largely determined by the central coalition,” UML assembly member Tharu told the Post. “A change in the Madhesh government is possible only if the Upendra Yadav-led JSP-Nepal breaks ties with the current coalition.”JSP-Nepal leader Anirudra Prasad Singh echoes UML leader Tharu. “The fate of the Madhesh provincial government will largely depend on the decision of the ruling coalition in Kathmandu,” Singh told the Post. Singh added, “But if the central coalition’s decision goes against us, we might have to step down from the Madhesh government leadership.”Notably, JSP-Nepal has continuously led the Madhesh government since the first provincial election held in 2017. In fact, the Upendra Yadav-led JSP-Nepal is the only party to continuously lead a provincial government for the past seven years. Other parties are thus considering a change this time around, said a Maoist Centre provincial assembly member. \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal has announced to knock the judiciary's door against the Election Commission's decision to recognise its spliter group as a new political party.The party led by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health and Population Upendra Yadav has concluded that the registration of Janata Samajbadi Party chaired by Ashok Rai is illegal.\"The new party was registered overnight even without the law to do so. Never in history has any new party been registered so swiftly,\" said Yadav, during a news conference on Wednesday. \"We will move the court against the illegal decision.\"As there are no legal provisions in the Political Parties Act relating to the formation of a new party after a split in an existing one, the commission registered the new party as per the regulation on political parties.On August 18, 2021, the then Sher Bahadur Deuba government had issued an ordinance to amend the Act to ease the split of two parties—the CPN-UML and the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal. Revising a provision in the Act, which requires the support of 40 percent members both in the parliamentary party and the central committee in order to split the party, the ordinance lowered the bar to 20 percent in any one of the committees.On August 26 that year, Madhav Kumar Nepal of the UML and Mahantha Thakur of the Janata Samajbadi registered new parties, the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, respectively.Two days later, the ordinance was repealed, having served its purpose. The provisions amended by the ordinance have become void after it was repealed. Though a bill to reactivate those provisions of the Act has been registered in Parliament, it is yet to be endorsed.\"The newly formed party is neither theoretically nor in principle different [from his party],\" he said, claiming that he had always been accommodative of the leaders from the dissident faction and made lawmakers and ministers. He had nothing more to offer, according to Yadav.The split follows a long-standing discontent in the party. The leaders of the Rai-led party claim that they had to revolt against the leadership as Yadav ran the party in an autocratic manner.A faction led by the party’s federal council chair Ashok Rai on Sunday filed an application at the commission to register a new party while Yadav was on a foreign trip. The commission on Monday registered the party with seven out of 12 members of the House of Representatives. That left only five lawmakers with Yadav. The commission has summoned the leaders to verify which party they want to choose.Yadav said the split was an outcome of the false narrative that attempts were being made to topple the government. It is nothing but rumor that a new government was being formed together with the Nepali Congress and the CPN (Unified Socialist), Yadav said.After his return from foreign trip, Yadav on Tuesday met Prime Minister and CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal to assure that his party will remain in the ruling alliance.The JSP-Nepal on Tuesday itself concluded that the present alliance should continue until the next elections. Rubbishing the speculations that attempts were being made to change the present alliance, Yadav claimed that he had not met any Congress leader after the formation of the new Dahal-led government in March.The present five-party alliance was formed on March 4 after the Maoist Centre ditched the Congress to join hands with the CPN-UML. \"We will continue our support to the government. The future course will be determined on the basis of how things unfold,\" he said.Yadav claimed that the party hasn't split; only a few people had left it. \"I still hold the majority in all party structures and committees,\" he said. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n\nA man, who was injured while putting out a fire at Tapeshwar community forest in Godawari Municipality-4, Badikhel, succumbed to burn injuries on Tuesday.According to Senior Superintended of Police Shekhar Khanal of Lalitpur District Police Range, Shankar Pahari died while undergoing treatment at the Kirtipur-based Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre.Another injured, Ramesh Pahari, is being treated at the hospital.Meanwhile, a fire at Ananda forest in Godawari Municipality-6, Lele is yet to be brought under control. A total of 65 patients have been moved to a safer place after the fire spread to the premises of the Anandaban Hospital. \nAt least seven wards of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City have started segregating degradable and non-degradable waste materials from the households, as the city office has enforced waste segregation rules in those local units.According to officials at the metropolis, Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have already started segregating the waste materials generated in the households.“Waste segregation rules have been expanded to seven wards,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department under the KMC. “Four more wards—6, 20,22,23—have also been preparing to segregate the waste materials.”The metropolis started collecting segregated wastes from ward 27 in February this year. The city office has also arranged separate garbage trucks to collect segregated waste materials from households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.“Compost made from degradable waste materials is now ready and interested people can approach us for it. We will provide it free of cost,” Shrestha said. “We will give priority to the people from the wards from where waste segregation rules have been enforced.”The metropolis has planned to use the compost in the plants and flowers and the garden inside the metropolis.Along with making compost out of discarded household waste, the metropolis has been also using degradable waste to fill in the bio-methanation plant, which was provided by the European Union.Shrestha said that waste materials filled in a tank of biogas have just started to produce gas, which is being filled in biogas balloons. Once the gas is filled in biogas balloons, it can be used in cooking and generating electricity.The KMC facility can generate 15 kilowatts of electricity from biogas.Making compost from discarded waste material and generating biogas and electricity are among the measures the metropolis is working on to lessen the quantity of waste materials in the city.Officials said they have been working to segregate degradable and non-degradable waste materials in various places in the city.The 32 wards of the metropolis will be divided into eight sectors and the waste materials will be segregated in the respective blocks.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparation on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.Meanwhile, the city office on Monday issued a tender notice to sell reusable non-degradable waste worth over Rs222 million. Those waste materials were segregated from the waste dumped in the landfill site in Bancharedanda. \nA comprehensive guide for Pashmina export has been launched, aiming to facilitate small-scale businesses in Nepal. The trade facilitation guide to export Pashmina from Nepal was jointly unveiled by Myriam Ferran, deputy director general for International Partnerships of European Commission; Ambassador of the European Union to Nepal Veronique Lorenzo; Baburam Adhikari, joint-secretary at the Ministry of Industry; and Dhan Prasad Lamichhane, president of the Nepal Pashmina Industries Association, amid a function organised at the Nepal Pashmina Fibre Processing Facility in Lalitpur on Tuesday.The fibre processing facility, established with technical support from the EU-Nepal Trade and Investment Programme, was also inaugurated at the same event. The plant has been processing fibre collected from Chyangra farmers and supplying it to Pashmina producers.As part of the European Union’s broader support to strengthening the Pashmina value chain, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies developed the guide with technical support from the EU-Nepal Trade and Investment Programme implemented by the International Trade Centre.This guide is specifically tailored to enhance Nepal's Pashmina export endeavours in major international markets such as Japan, the European Union, the US, and the UK.The guide explains step-by-step processes, encompassing firm registration, licensing, directives, customs, shipment, and logistics procedures. Moreover, it offers insights into the import requirements specified by destination countries, shedding light on tariffs, quality standards, shipping costs, timeframes, and the essential documents needed, along with other crucial trade information.The ‘Nepal Trade Integration Strategy 2023’ identifies Chyangra Pashmina as a highly prioritised exportable product. Similarly, the 'Pashmina Sector Export National Strategy 2022-2026' aims to elevate Pashmina exports to the $75 million mark by 2026.Speaking on the occasion, Joint-secretary Adhikari said, “Nepal’s Himalayan Chyangra Pashmina holds a distinguished position in the international market due to its unique quality and cultural significance. The government of Nepal has designated Pashmina as one of the high-priority exportable products. The guide is poised to become a useful source of information about the process for Nepali Pashmina exports, offering comprehensive information about our destination markets.”Ferran said, “As a longstanding partner in Nepal's development journey, the European Union reaffirms its unwavering dedication to bolstering Nepal's prosperity through enhanced trade and investment avenues. This comprehensive guide serves as an instrument to support the Pashmina value chain to harness the immense potential of Nepal’s Chyangra Pashmian in the international market.” \nNcell unveils \"Sadhain ON\" campaign to advance its 5G vision by eliminating unintended data charges, reducing data plans, and offering social media data bonuses.\nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Wednesday inaugurated the EU-Nepal Business Forum 2024 stressing that the green economy would be at the centre of Nepal’s future prosperity.He said the government was reforming the legal landscape to ensure the ease of doing business and attract private investment. The prime minister said the 50 years of EU-Nepal relationship, also marks the beginning of a new chapter for shared growth and prosperity. The inauguration session was attended by Damodar Bhandari, Minister, Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, Myriam Ferran, Deputy Director General, International Partnerships, European Commission, ambassadors from eight EU Member States, and the Global Director of the European Investment Bank (EIB).Addressing the opening session, the EU Deputy Director General of International Partnerships said the European Union’s Global offer for sustainable investment, Global Gateway, was already supporting renewable energy and would further support investments in priority sectors for Nepal.The business forum brought together over 300 participants, including 50 panellists who discussed different sectors, including renewable energy, information and communication technologies, high-end tourism, and agriculture. The EU Ambassador to Nepal, Veronique Lorenzo, mentioned Nepal's achievements, such as the 64 percent growth in IT service exports in 2022 to 500 million euros and the arrival of over a million tourists in 2023. These achievements are also opportunities for European businesses.Ambassador Lorenzo added that Nepal had approved about 400 projects of around Rs47 billion since the last business forum, with notable contributions from small firms. The first EU-Nepal Business Forum was organised in 2023. \n Secretary General of the Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry Ramesh Sharma has been appointed as the Honorary Consul General of Kyrgyzstan to Nepal.The flag hosting and inauguration ceremony were held in the presence of Non-residential Ambassador to Nepal Askar Beshimov.Sharma is the chair of Sharma and Company, a construction company based in Nepal.Sharma’s appointment and establishment of the Honorary Consulate office in Nepal would foster enhancing and strengthening the bilateral economic relations between the two countries, NICCI said in a statement. Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country surrounded by China in the East, Kazakhstan in the North, Tajikistan in the Southwest, and Uzbekistan in the West. It achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved.The country is rich in hydropower, gold, rare earth metals, locally exploitable coal, oil, and natural gas, among other resources. \nAs pre-monsoon rains pick up pace, concerns mount about an imminent outbreak of the dengue disease. All that is required for the disease to flare up are stagnant water and hot temperatures, both already present in various parts of the country.“Dengue vectors are already there in many places across the country,” said Professor Murari Das, an entomologist at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “With the right conditions like water and warmth required for vector breeding available now, we can expect a spike in dengue cases in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said that 57 districts, including three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur—have already reported cases of dengue infection.“On average, around 50 people across the country are becoming infected with the dengue virus every week,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “The number could rise in the coming days, as pre-monsoon rainfall activities have recently increased.”Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease throughout the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Around 1,000 people have already been infected with the deadly disease since the start of 2024, according to officials.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of people infected with the deadly virus do not show any symptoms. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus throughout the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Experts say that this is the right time to prepare and prevent possible outbreaks in the coming days.They say that it will be too late if they wait for a massive outbreak. Authorities concerned should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance and take other measures to cut the risk, according to them. Health Ministry officials said that they have alerted all agencies concerned about the risk of a dengue outbreak.“We have alerted all relevant agencies about the risk of a dengue outbreak in the coming days,’ said Dahal. Authorities and agencies at some local units have started activities to make people aware of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, including launching an awareness drive.”Dengue has become endemic in Nepal, as cases of infection are reported throughout the year. Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities are yet to take it seriously. They believe that this lackadaisical approach is responsible for the spread of the virus. What authorities concerned do most of the time is count the number of infections and deaths, according to them.They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nIn Nepal, the Ministry of Health plans to screen pregnant women for mental health issues, aiming to reduce maternal deaths due to self-harm that have been on the rise, with such deaths accounting for 6% of the total.\n50 health workers in Kathmandu received training to screen patients for non-communicable diseases, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancer, with medications and referrals provided to patients in need.\nIn less than 2% of registered medicines tested, Nepal's drug regulator finds substandard drugs in the market despite slow testing and insufficient staff.\nDue to severe air pollution in Kathmandu and Saptari districts, an increasing number of children are suffering from childhood asthma, exacerbating public health concerns and shortening life expectancy by approximately five years.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra, a James Beard scholar, establishes 'The Sewing Tin' in New York to elevate and share Nepali cuisine globally, infusing it with modern culinary techniques and storytelling inspired by the immigrant experience.\nCeleus Baral's passion for baking led her to establish Bakeleus, an online baking shop featuring eco-conscious creations inspired by her environmental science background and a focus on patience and experimentation.\nPotato, a staple food of hundreds of thousands of people, especially those residing in the mountainous regions, is among the most widely consumed and versatile crops in Nepal. The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nSantoo Shrestha on Wednesday made history by becoming the first Nepali table tennis player to qualify for the Olympics.Shrestha qualified for the men’s singles table tennis competition at the 2024 Summer Olympics after he defeated his compatriot Samyog Kapali 11-7, 8-11, 11-7, 11-6, 8-11, 11-9 in the final of the 2024 South Asian Qualification Tournament, which was held in Table Tennis Training Centre in Kathmandu.The 2024 Olympics is scheduled to be held from July 26 to August 11 in Paris, France.Shrestha had defeated Sri Lanka’s Chameera Ginige 11-7, 11-9, 6-11, 8-11, 11-3, 11-8 to enter the gold medal match, while Kapali was a 13-11, 11-7, 12-10, 11-7 winner against Jayasanka De Silva, also from Sri Lanka.Shrestha also became the third Nepali player to qualify for the Olympics after Sangina Baidhya at Athens 2004 and Deepak Bista in Beijing 2008. Both Baidhya and Bista are taekwondo players and practitioners.Nepal will be making its 15th appearance at the Summer Olympics since making a debut in 1964.Track and field athlete Santoshi Shrestha and badminton player Prince Dahal will also represent Nepal at Paris 2024.Santoshi and Dahal gained entry into the Olympics after receiving universality spots.Santoshi will participate in the women's marathon while Dahal will compete in the men's singles badminton event.Dahal will be the first badminton player from Nepal to participate at the Olympics. \nCoach Vincenzo Alberto Annese has announced a 28-member preliminary squad for Nepal’s 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup second round qualifier match against the United Arab Emirates.Rohit Chand has returned to the squad after missing out both legs against Bahrain in March.Defenders Abhishek Limbu, Bishal Basnet, Saubhagya Rai and Ajay Chaudhary, midfielder Rohan Karki and forward Samir Tamang, who were called up for the first time for Bahrain games, have retained their place in the preliminary squad.Nepal, pitted in Group H alongside the UAE, Bahrain and Yemen, have already crashed out of the second round without playing their remaining two matches after a winless run of four successive matches left them at the bottom of the group and without a point.Nepal were scheduled to host the UAE for their second leg at the Dasharath Stadium—Nepal’s only international standard football stadium—on June 6 but will once again play their home fixture at a neutral venue, according to All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) sources. “Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has directed ANFA to find a neutral venue for the UAE fixture citing lack of standard of Dasharath Stadium,” an ANFA source said.AFC representatives had raised questions about the stadium’s pitch, flood light and security following an inspection earlier this month. AFC and ANFA, however, have yet to make their decision public.Nepal were also forced to play their home match against Bahrain at the Bahrain National Stadium in Riffa after AFC deemed Dasharath Stadium unsatisfactory to host the World Cup qualifier game.Nepal lost the double fixture against Bahrain 5-0 and 3-0, which had effectively ended Nepal’s hopes to progress to the third round and book an automatic spot in the Asian Cup.Earlier, Nepal had lost their home match against Yemen 2-0 in Kathmandu and away match to the UAE 4-0 at the Al-Maktoum Stadium in Dubai.Nepal will wrap up their qualifier campaign with a match against Yemen on June 11.Nepal still have hopes to qualify for their maiden Asian Cup. They will play in the Asian Cup Qualification (playoffs) in March next year.Nepal squadGoalkeepers: Abhishek Baral, Bishal Sunar, Kiran Chemjong, Santosh MahatDefenders: Abhishek Limbu, Ananta Tamang, Bimal Pandey, Bishal Basnet, Chhiring Lama, Rohit Chand, Sanish Shrestha, Saubhagya Rai, Ajay Chaudhary, Yogesh GurungMidfielders: Bharat Khawas, Laken Limbu, Mani Kumar Lama, Manish Dangi, Basant Jimba, Phatteman Ghale, Rohan Karki, Sumit ShresthaForwards: Anjan Bista, Dinesh Henjan, Gillespye Jung Karki, Hisub Thapaliya, Samir Tamang, Sanjeeb Bista \nRussian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing early on Thursday for talks with counterpart Xi Jinping that the Kremlin hopes will deepen a strategic partnership between the two most powerful geopolitical rivals of the United States.China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership in February 2022 when Putin visited Beijing just days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, triggering the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two.By picking China for his first foreign trip since being sworn in for a six-year term that will keep him in power until at least 2030, Putin is sending a message to the world about his priorities and the strength of his personal ties with Xi.In an interview with China’s Xinhua news agency, Putin praised Xi for helping to build a “strategic partnership” with Russia based on national interests and deep mutual trust.“It was the unprecedentedly high level of the strategic partnership between our countries that determined my choice of China as the first state that I would visit after taking office as president,” Putin said.“We will try to establish closer co-operation in the fields of industry and high technology, space and peaceful nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy sources and other innovative sectors.”Informal chats between the leaders and senior officials of both sides held over tea and dinner on Thursday are expected to be key to the two-day trip.Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said those talks would range over Ukraine, Asia, energy and trade.Putin’s newly appointed defence minister, Andrei Belousov, as well as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu and Ushakov will also attend, along with Russia’s most powerful CEOs.It was not immediately clear if Gazprom (GAZP.MM), opens new tab CEO Alexei Miller would go to China as he was on a working visit to Iran on Wednesday.Celebration of 75 years of tiesPutin, 71, and Xi, 70, will participate in a gala celebration of 75 years since the Soviet Union recognised the People’s Republic of China, which Mao Zedong declared in 1949.Xinhua confirmed Putin’s arrival for a state visit and the expected talks with Xi, while dozens of large Russian and Chinese flags fluttered around Tiananmen Square amid police patrols.Some commentaries have hailed the pair’s “great power diplomacy”.The event is the top trending item on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, with 1.4 million search requests.The United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat while U.S. President Joe Biden says this century will be defined by an existential contest between democracies and autocracies.Putin and Xi share a broad world view, which casts the West as decadent and declining, just as China challenges U.S. supremacy in everything from quantum computing and synthetic biology to espionage and hard military power.Putin will also visit the northeastern city of Harbin, which has historic ties to Russia. A mall devoted to Russian-made goods from about 80 Russian manufacturers opened on Thursday, the China Daily said.China has strengthened trade and military ties with Russia in recent years as the United States and its allies imposed sanctions on both countries, particularly Moscow, for its invasion of Ukraine.Western governments say China has played a crucial role in helping Russia withstand the sanctions and has supplied key technology that Russia has used on the battlefield in Ukraine.But China, once Moscow’s junior partner in the global Communist hierarchy, is by far the most powerful of Russia’s friends globally.Putin’s arrival follows a mission to Beijing late last month by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in part to warn China’s top diplomat Wang Yi against deepening military support for Russia. \nBANSKA BYSTRICASlovak Prime Minister Robert Fico is no longer in a life-threatening condition after he was shot in an assassination attempt when leaving a government meeting on Wednesday, a government minister said.The gunman shot Fico, 59, five times, initially leaving the prime minister in critical condition and undergoing surgery hours later on Wednesday evening.“I was very shocked ... fortunately as far as I know the operation went well - and I guess in the end he will survive ... he’s not in a life-threatening situation at this moment,” Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Environment Minister Tomas Taraba told the BBC’s Newshour.Taraba said one bullet went through Fico’s stomach and a second hit a joint.News outlet Aktuality.sk cited an unnamed source saying Fico was out of surgery and in stable condition.Defence Minister Robert Kalinak told a news briefing hours earlier that Fico had suffered “serious polytrauma” after several shot wounds.Interior Minister Matus Sutaj Estok had said earlier that Fico was in a life-threatening condition while he remained in the operating room.“This assassination (attempt) was politically motivated and the perpetrator’s decision was born closely after the presidential election,” Sutaj Estok said, referring to an April election won by a Fico ally, Peter Pellegrini.The shooting in the central Slovak town of Handlova, which Slovak media said was carried out by a 71-year-old man, stunned the small central European nation and drew international condemnation.Slovakia, a member of NATO and the European Union, has little history of political violence. Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden joined Slovakia’s EU partners in expressing shock and condemnation of the shooting.The country of 5.4 million has seen polarised political debate in recent years, including the hard-fought presidential election last month that helped tighten Fico’s grip on power.Since returning as prime minister last October, Fico has shifted policy quickly. Opposition critics call it a power grab.His government has scaled back support for Ukraine while opening dialogue with Russia, sought to weaken punishments for corruption and dismantled a special prosecutor’s office, and is revamping the RTVS public broadcaster despite calls to protect media freedom.Fico has long been critical of Slovakia’s mainstream media, refusing to speak to some outlets. Members of his party blasted media and opposition actions in recent months.“I ask all to stop piling attacks, expressions of hate, on social networks, in the media, which are aimed at that or another political camp, regardless if it concerns the (government) coalition or the opposition,” Sutaj Estok said.After the attack, Fico was rushed to hospital in Handlova where he had been chairing a government meeting. He was then transported by helicopter to regional capital Banska Bystrica for urgent treatment, it said, adding that his condition was too serious for him to be taken to Bratislava.A Reuters witness heard shots as Fico exited a building to shake hands with a crowd of people who had been waiting to greet him. Police then wrestled a man to the ground.Slovak news media reported the shooter was a former security guard at a shopping mall, an author of three collections of poetry and a member of the Slovak Society of Writers. News outlet Aktuality.sk cited his son as saying his father was the legal holder of a gun licence.“I have absolutely no idea what my father intended, what he planned, what happened,” it quoted the son as saying.Broadcaster TA3 reported the leftist prime minister had been hit in the abdomen in the attack.“I don’t think I will wake up from this,” 66-year-old Lubica Valkova told reporters on the scene. “This kind of thing just can’t happen in Slovakia.”VETERAN LEADERFico, a dominant force in Slovakia for two decades, has drawn criticism for taking a more pro-Russian stance in the Ukraine war.Describing the shooting as a “monstrous” crime, Putin said in a telegram sent to Slovakia’s President Zuzana Caputova: “I know Robert Fico as a courageous and strong-minded man. I very much hope that these qualities will help him to survive this difficult situation.”Biden offered U.S. help to Slovakia, saying in a statement: “We condemn this horrific act of violence.”Slovakia’s biggest opposition party Progressive Slovakia called off a planned protest and called for restraint to avoid escalating tensions. Parliament suspended debate indefinitely after the attack.In his career, Fico has moved between the pro-European mainstream and nationalistic positions opposed to EU and U.S. policies. He has also shown a willingness to change course depending on public opinion or changed political realities.An admirer of Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Fico has grown increasingly critical of Western support for Ukraine in its war with invading Russian forces.Fico was forced to resign as premier amid mass protests in 2018 triggered by the contract killing of Jan Kuciak, a journalist who had been investigating high-level corruption. Those protests exacerbated divisions in Slovak society that still linger. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe government will present the budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024/25 in a few days. In Nepal’s federal structure, functional responsibilities are devolved to the sub-federal levels while revenue remains centralised. The constitution aims to decentralise revenue through legislation. To achieve this, fiscal transfers to the sub-federal levels are ensured by the constitution. These fiscal transfers are done through four grants: Fiscal equalisation, conditional, special, and matching grants. Among these grants, the fiscal equalisation grant is vital; it is considered unconditional and includes full autonomy to the subnational governments.Between FY2018/19 and FY2023/24, all seven provinces received an average annual grant of Rs112 billion, while local levels received Rs261 billion. Annually, each province received an average of Rs16 billion and local levels received around Rs350 million in grants from the Government of Nepal. Although the local levels receiving Rs350 million yearly sounds positive from the outside, the situation looks disappointing from within.The principle of grants stipulates that the ratio of fiscal equalisation grants to the total budget or GDP should increase. However, this ratio has decreased. Consequently, the proportion of equalisation grants allocated to the sub-federal levels in the total budget was 10.27 percent in FY2018/19, declining to 8.34 percent in FY2023/24. This indicates a serious flaw in grant distribution, necessitating improvement. The situation is even more disappointing at the local level, where the percentage of equalisation grants among the four grants received was 41.38 percent in FY2018/19, with conditional grants comprising 53.74 percent. In FY2023/24, the percentage of equalisation grants decreased to 29.61 percent, while conditional grants increased to 65 percent. This highlights the disproportionate burden of conditional grants at the local level. The share of special and matching grants in the total grant is only 5 percent. However, the government has yet to understand the definition of a special grant. Matching grants will be distributed based on the demand of sub-federal levels to fill the resource gap in certain projects and programmes. The government will distribute the special grant based on the supply side after considering factors such as poverty scenarios, among others, at the sub-federal levels. Furthermore, this grant is also used to compensate for the Fiscal Equalisation Grant. The government has not yet considered this aspect, and it should seriously review all types of grant allocations, including special and matching grants.Grant distribution remains unfair, with no improvement in the trend of people visiting ministers and ministries for programmes and projects. From local government chiefs to federal parliamentarians, ministries are overcrowded. Many ministries allocate programme budgets at their discretion, with a significant portion favouring the constituencies of the prime minister and ministers. Subsequently, the budget is directed towards senior leaders, influential parliamentarians, secretaries, and so forth. This situation mirrors the pre-federalisation era, albeit with a slightly reduced budget being distributed haphazardly. During discussions on the ministerial budget for FY2023/24 in parliament, I raised concerns about the projects and programmes of certain ministries. The allocated program budget is even lower than that of previous village development committees.The World Bank published a report on Monday that was consistent with the facts stated above. Specifically, the report unveiled the 'Nepal Fiscal Federalism Update 2024', which aims to assess Nepal's progress in fiscal federalism and examine the alignment between the 2015 Constitution's fiscal federalism vision and present realities.The report reveals that fiscal balances of sub-federal levels slipped into deficit in FY2022/23 for the first time since the implementation of fiscal federalism in Nepal. Provincial governments recorded a consolidated fiscal balance deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in FY2022/23, attributed to decreased revenue and grants, which dropped to a record low of 3.5 percent of GDP. Conversely, expenditure saw only a marginal increase to 3.8 percent of GDP. However, there was notable variation in fiscal balances among provinces, ranging from a deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in Sudurpashchim to a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in Madhesh. Local governments also experienced a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in FY2022/23, stemming from a significant decrease in revenue and grants compared to the previous fiscal year. The report further highlights a decline in consolidated revenue and grants of sub-federal levels to a record low in FY2022/23, mainly due to reduced intergovernmental grants and revenue sharing. Provincial governments' revenue and grants dropped to 3.5 percent of GDP, driven by a decrease in intergovernmental revenue, constituting over 90 percent of provincial revenue. Local government revenue and grants declined to 8 percent of GDP in FY2022/23. Despite the decline in fiscal transfers from the federal to local levels, provincial transfers to localities remained unchanged. Notably, property taxes and local government service fees constituted over 70 percent of local governments' own-source revenue. Regarding expenditure, provincial government spending slightly increased to 3.8 percent of GDP, driven by elevated capital spending, particularly in infrastructure projects. Recurrent expenditure accounted for only 40 percent of total provincial expenditure. Conversely, local government spending saw a marginal decrease to 8.4 percent of GDP in FY2022/23 primarily due to reduced capital spending. A significant gap persists between sub-federal levels' expenditure and revenue, with only 8 percent of provincial spending and 6 percent of local spending financed by own revenue, leading to a marginal increase in the vertical fiscal gap in FY2022/23. The report also notes stagnation in own-source revenue collection, indicating moderate improvement in revenue assignment policies and weaknesses in revenue administration. It emphasises the necessity of upgrading institutional arrangements to manage the fiscal transfer system effectively. It highlights the absence of a legal provision/procedure for determining the pool of funds to be transferred through fiscal transfers and recommends increasing the ratio of Fiscal Equalisation Grants within the pool of resources to strengthen sub-federal levels' planning and decision-making. Moreover, the report suggests establishing transparent, consultative processes and technical methodologies for determining the divisible pool for fiscal transfers to enhance predictability and increase fiscal autonomy at sub-federal levels. The major challenge identified within the fiscal transfer system is the allocation of conditional grants, for which the bank proposes reducing conditional grants while enhancing fiscal equalisation, retaining conditional grants for federal responsibilities delegated to sub-federal levels, and allocating funds based on transparent criteria and procedures to align with the needs of sub-federal levels. Lastly, the report recommends determining and publishing grant amounts earlier in the fiscal year to facilitate improved planning and execution. Coming back to the budget, most ministries at the federal level act no less than those in the Rana era, with ministers often allocating budgets solely to their constituencies. Projects are frequently sent to the sub-federal levels as conditional grants. The constitution designates the province as the key entity for development, emphasising that infrastructure development should be led by the province, not the federal ministry—a principle underscored in the constitution. Out of the 22 ministries at the federal level, we need just between eight and ten, as more than half of the ministries overstep their jurisdiction. When presenting the budget, the government should embrace the spirit of the constitution and acknowledge the existence of provincial and local governments. \nMany years ago in West Bengal, I encountered school-age boys playing Carrom or cricket all day. Curious as to why they weren’t at school or out working, they responded: “We are all employed. We do party-r-byabsa (‘business of the party,’ or work for the Communist Party of India-Marxist).”“We participate in rallies, attend meetings, and mobilise people on election days. In return, the party gives us small contracts (such as repairing roads, tube wells, etc.).”This ‘business of the party’, as British Anthropologist F.G. Bailey called it, worked on the basis of parties distributing minor contracts to their workers at the grassroots level.Times have changed.Political parties are now corporate entities. They no longer depend on self-sacrificing volunteer full-timers, but party office bearers. These functionaries are paid handsomely, travel by aeroplanes or air-conditioned cars and stay in five-star hotels. They look more like party executives than workers. The party offices resemble luxurious hotels or corporate headquarters. For all this, political parties need to build a massive war chest. A part of that money must be in ‘white’—-auditable and traceable.Corporations and ultra-high net-worth individuals need the ruling parties to capture regulatory apparatus, get access to lucrative natural resources and government contracts, buy state enterprises and competitors (often taking advantage of insolvency and bankruptcy resolutions) at an undervalued price. The scandal of electoral bonds in India has revealed this new quid pro quo relationship between the ruling party and the corporate world.The sectors which purchased the bulk of the electoral bonds included mining and power generation, ‘sinful industry’ (lottery and gaming), infrastructure contractors and real estate developers, buyers of undervalued state shares, and highly regulated sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, civil aviation, banking and telecommunications. These bond purchasers stood to gain windfall profits by receiving favours from the Union government at the Centre as well as the parties running the state governments. Some companies have donated money to political parties worth more than their combined profit during the period of purchase of an electoral bond. This perhaps points to them fronting for some hidden entities. There are also allegations of shell companies donating electoral bonds. The News Minute found that many companies were raided by the Central Enforcement Directorate (which investigates money laundering) and the Income Tax Department before they purchased electoral bonds. This points to a coercive mechanism of extracting donations by the powers that be. Unsurprisingly, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has cornered a disproportionate amount of these electoral bonds, putting it in the pole position financially in the general elections in 2024.Surprisingly none of the corporate houses believed to have a close relationship with particular political parties were shown to have purchased any electoral bonds at all. The Supreme Court took a long time to pronounce a verdict but declared the electoral bonds illegal and unconstitutional. It forced the State Bank of India (the sole designated seller of the bonds) to reveal the details of the purchasers and redeemers.Nevertheless, the court allowed the recipient parties to retain and use the donations.This connection between business and politics is nothing new.At the national level, there has always been a quid pro quo relationship between the political and the business elite. The business elite funds political parties and elections in return for favourable policies pertaining to their industry.Three events have shaped these links: The liberalisation of the Indian economy in the 1980s and 1990s, the 9/11 terror attack on New York and the rise of social media. With economic liberalisation, the government’s infrastructural projects at the grassroots level increased massively, expanding the scope of offering contracts to local party leaders, workers, and followers. The commodification of land that followed was crucial. In a land-scarce country, the demand for land went up exponentially in the 1990s. Provincial political leaders in and around urban centres began to control the supply of land for real estate, industry, academic institutions and hospitals. Political parties expect their expenses covered by such local-level leaders.The bigger game is played at the national level. In a liberalised economy, monopolies and oligopolies are created not by erecting entry barriers but by strangling competition, capturing the regulatory apparatus and monopolising financial resources. The politics and business nexus help in this.The growth of social media has also come in handy for political parties in managing public perception. The parties profile and target individual voters and influence them using social media platforms. They exploit algorithms to ensure their content is spread far and wide while suppressing the opposition’s messages. This requires a vast war chest, to pay for party officials, professional agencies and IT workers. Money is also needed to place advertisements. This lavish ad spend makes the political terrain unbalanced. In certain instances, the opposition parties’ bank accounts were frozen to deprive them of money to buy advertisement slots and campaigns.The 9/11 terror attack also affected global financial transactions by forcing transparency.. Financial institutions must now do due diligence to track and audit the digital footprints of transactions. It is imperative for private corporations, and now even political parties, to maintain a clean money trail. After the electoral bonds scandal, however, India needs to rethink the regulation of political funding to create a level playing field. The transformation will not be easy. Nevertheless, there may be a way forward. First by ensuring the ruling party does not abuse the Income Tax, Enforcement Directorate and its other investigative agencies to force political donations. It should be answerable directly to Parliament and its oversight committees. Second, elections could be publicly funded. The financial resources for this could be generated from a cess 9an additional tax) on corporations and industrial use of natural resources. Third, TV and print media could be mandated to allocate advertisement slots on a proportional basis to all recognised political parties. Finally, social media and technology companies should make declarations and furnish weekly reports on the activities of political parties and their proxies. Any deviance can be flagged and blocked. -360info \n“It [Nepal] must move away from merely paying lip service to the ideals of achieving equality for all but take a concrete human rights-centric approach to relegating descent-based discrimination to the dustbins of history.” These are the powerful words of Fernanda Doz Costa, Amnesty International’s director of the gender and racial discrimination programme, at the launch of Amnesty International Nepal’s report on Dalits on May 10, 2024. Researched in 2023, the report is entitled ‘“No-one Cares”: Descent-Based Discrimination Against Dalits’.In this column, I analyse the report, focusing on its strengths and limitations while appreciating its potential value for the Dalit freedom struggle.A useful exercise All the talk about human rights and justice appears hollow in today’s world as we watch the horrifying images of the Israeli forces slaughtering tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians—many of them women and children—with total impunity. Even the United Nations has failed to stop this genocide.One wonders, then, what difference the voice of any human rights organisation or movement would make in any way, anywhere at all. While the concerns of international human rights organisations like Amnesty International may practically mean nothing for rich and powerful countries with powerful blind supporters like Israel, they could still prove useful in powerless and donor-dependent countries like ours. Here, Western governments and agencies have a degree of leverage, which could be utilised to liberate the suppressed masses. I, therefore, commend the organisation for carrying out this research on the largely forgotten caste discrimination issue. If anything, this report helps amplify voices against the persistent suffering of the Dalits and the total apathy of the state and non-state actors, both at the national and international levels. The study’s findings are largely consistent with the everyday experiences of most Dalits across the country and, to some extent, in the diaspora communities too. Additionally, the Amnesty report gives a set of specific and notable recommendations to the federal parliament, the prime minister’s office, the home ministry, as well as to the National Human Rights Commission, the Dalit Commission and UN agencies to take Dalit issues seriously and take appropriate measures to tackle them. Indeed, silence and inaction have persisted for too long while Dalits continue to be killed, injured, raped, humiliated and excluded; caste bigotry and hate are on the rise. And, as the report rightly suggests, Dalit women and girls have suffered the most. The report’s findings and recommendations can help Dalit activists raise their voices and garner wider support and solidarity for their cause. It could become a catalyst for generating greater interest in the issue and reviving and revitalising the Dalit movement, which has become dormant over the years. Forgotten religion and culture The Amnesty report repeatedly asks Nepali authorities not to limit Dalit problems to criminalisation and to find a more holistic solution. Unfortunately, the report itself lacks a nuanced or holistic analysis. Too much emphasis on impunity and an unresponsive legal and judicial system overshadows the bigger picture. The analysis is shallow, as religion and culture, the tectonic plates that move the whole thing, have been ignored. The report does occasionally mention the “Hindu caste system” but refrains from delving into it. This is a wrong approach because the fundamental underlying cause of the persistence and prevalence of caste discrimination is the Hindu religion and culture. I don’t state this as a scholar or an activist; ask any non-political and ordinary Dalit person, and the facts will become clear. In the everyday experience of the Dalits, including many Dalit leaders and activists themselves, caste-based humiliation and exclusion are based on their ritually polluted status. Lack of access to power, poverty, illiteracy and other factors are secondary. As we sometimes see in news reports, even mayors and ward or municipal chairs in many parts of the country face caste-based exclusion. I’m sure many Dalit lawmakers themselves would struggle to rent property in Kathmandu because the landlords fear offending their ancestral spirits and other deities through contact with the ritually polluted! Herein lies the root of the problem: Nepalis are highly religious and spiritual people who live in constant fear and awe of their gods, their lineage deities, and the spirit of their dead ancestors. There is a strong belief that any transgression of the traditional ritual hierarchy based on caste would offend the supernatural powers, thereby causing death and destruction in the family and community. Caste is so sacred that many Nepalis would rather go to jail or even die than flout certain caste rules and “invite” the terrible wrath of their gods or deceased relatives. For these fundamentalists, state laws and law enforcement hardly mean anything.Why has there been a surge in attacks against the Dalits in recent years? Why don’t many police officers, administrators and judges take the caste discrimination issue seriously? Why do prime ministers and ministers and legislators turn a deaf ear to Dalit voices for change? Why have Dalit activists themselves not been very effective in defending their rights? All these questions can be answered with just two words: Religion and culture. There is a contradiction between state laws and religious/cultural laws. Today’s policemen and judges probably don’t need to be preached about universal human rights, but they also cannot deny their long-standing cultural and spiritual beliefs and practices of keeping their castes sacred. If religio-cultural traditions have greatly ‘caste-ified’ our social psychology, how can those in legal and judicial power positions be immune from it? This is the crux of the problem that needs unpacking by all sides.Problem with methodology?I understand the sensitivities surrounding religion and culture in any country or society. I don’t know why the Amnesty report remained silent on these complex yet vital issues. However, I suspect part of the problem lies in the research methodology itself. If you want new insights into any topic, you must involve and work with the younger generation. During the report’s launch, I saw the same old faces of Dalit activists and lawyers. I don’t mean to undermine their ongoing and historical contribution, but the new and younger generation also deserves a voice. The report was prepared with support from and consultation with Dalit non-governmental organisations that have long been commanded by the same old people. Moreover, they are usually connected to a political party, and upper-caste leaders invariably control every party. No wonder, mainstream Dalit discourse is still shy about putting religion and culture in the spotlight. The report itself makes it amply clear that the Dalit movement thus far has been toothless and that there is a need for new ways of tackling the problem. However, to show a new direction for freedom fighters and organise a paradigm shift, international players must move beyond their usual consultation with the same old activists and groups and find new kids on the block. Talking directly with the ordinary Dalits instead of through mediation with established groups would make ground realities apparent.  \nSenior leaders from seven major political parties—both the ruling as well as opposition forces—on Sunday made an unequivocal collective pledge to make maximum effort to promote the country’s investment and business climate. Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, CPN (Maoist Centre) vice-chair Pampha Bhusal, Rastriya Prajatantra Party chair Rajendra Lingden, Rastriya Swatantra Party Chief Whip Santosh Pariyar, CPN (Unified Socialist) General Secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal and Janamat Party chair CK Raut, while airing their respective party’s views at the Kantipur Economic Summit-2024, also emphasised the need for the political forces and other stakeholders to work hand in hand in order to attract investment.It was just two weeks ago that top leaders of the country including Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba of Nepali Congress and KP Sharma Oli, chair of a major coalition partner CPN-UML, while addressing the two-day Investment Summit, committed to spare no effort to turn Nepal into an investment-friendly destination. Presenting Nepal as a country of huge potential, the leaders made the promises before 1,600-plus representatives from 55 countries in the government-organised summit. Realisation of the need for domestic as well as foreign investments and joint political commitments of rival political forces in itself is a positive gesture.However this is not enough. Nepal’s politicians have time and again made such promises but failed to translate them into results. For that, Nepal still needs political as well as policy stability and predictability. Various countries have made tremendous progress even when there is instability in government leadership. They did so by keeping development activities separate from politics and ensuring policy predictability, even if there are constant changes in governments. One big concern of the representatives from the business communities expressed at the Kantipur Economic Summit was the same. They said genuine investors seek policy predictability as a prerequisite before making a sizable investment. This is a valid concern and the policy makers must ensure so much.Yet the initiatives of the government and our politicians appear more superficial than substantive. Just ahead of the investment summit, the government amended some Acts through an ordinance to clear legal complexities for investment. It was the government’s intent to create an impression before the international participants that Nepal is serious about getting money from abroad. But the ordinances couldn’t be tabled in the first meeting of the House of Representatives on Friday due to the ongoing obstruction of the main opposition party Nepali Congress. There is a prolonged deadlock in Parliament. The ruling and opposition parties are in a face-off over a parliamentary panel to probe Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The minister is accused of involvement in multiple cooperative frauds. The House obstruction by the main opposition over the demand first made in the winter session has continued even after the commencement of the budget session on May 10. If our political parties cannot even come together to pass the national budget, it would be hard for foreigners to trust us with their money. The only way Nepal will attract quality investment and make a leap in its development endeavour is through a collective political effort to ensure policy consistency. For the country’s larger good, they must also be able to see beyond their partisan interests.  \nAs the midsummer mercury rises, storing fresh food remains a challenge. In a country where the usage of refrigerators remains limited to urban areas, there is a risk of food getting contaminated. Moreover, our general attitude towards food safety and preservation, especially in eateries, is casual. For instance, we see meat shops openly displaying raw meat items all day on tables and showcases, without the use of freezers. Sweet shops and restaurants are no better, as they are tempted to display their food items to attract customers. Even though the food might look appealing to our eyes when it is served in eateries, it is ultimately harmful to our health as many do not follow the proper food safety protocols. The open display of food items invites bacteria and dust contamination, apart from the obvious heat-related hazards, leading to the onslaught of various diseases, including cholera and food poisoning, apart from a lack of nutrition. Although Nepal has food safety regulations in place, the lack of implementation and monitoring continues to pose the risk of food-borne diseases to the public. The Food Act, 2023 (1967) prohibits the production, sale or distribution of adulterated foodstuff or sub-standard foodstuff. By adulterated foodstuff, the Act means \"foodstuffs rotten so as to be harmful to health, or prepared or kept in a filthy or toxic condition\". In January last year, Nepal implemented a new set of food safety regulations, which has provisions for the careful production, processing, packaging, handling, storage and supply purity of food. The regulations also have provisions for labelling the food, including its nutritional value.However, apart from poor implementation of such regulations, the monitoring of the regulations is almost non-existent. In rare instances when food inspectors from municipalities bother to monitor the food in eateries, there is a high chance of such eateries being found flouting the regulations. For instance, in Kathmandu, as in most parts of the country, food items, especially items like meat that get contaminated quickly, are laid out in the open and sold. This causes great health risks, but the authorities of all levels of government seem either oblivious to or uninterested in the issue. In Kathmandu Metropolitan City, for instance, the authorities' focus is on removing the food vendors altogether, guided by a flawed notion of gentrification rather than regulating them under tax and food safety regimes. In other parts of the country, hardly anyone bothers to check the quality of food provided to customers.The state cannot remain a mute spectator when the health of the citizens is put at risk due to the carelessness of vendors. Rather, the state should strictly maintain food safety standards regularly—not in an episodic pattern, such as during festivals or at the whims of authorities but as a standard practice. Some basic steps include making it mandatory for vendors to keep appropriate food items in freezers, use covering, and segregate food items to avoid cross-contamination. As the culture of eating out is becoming increasingly common, especially among young people, the state should actively enforce food preservation and safety regulations to keep the citizens healthy. \nThe investigation into the Nepal Children’s Organization land lease scam has entered a significant stage, with the Central Investigation Bureau issuing arrest warrants against 20 of the accused. The individuals against whom the warrants have been issued after a nod from the Kathmandu District Court include former office bearers of the organisation and representatives of business institutions that have benefitted from the scam. With the latest development, some of the organisation’s prominent individuals, including the then vice-chair Tulasi Narayan Shrestha, then general secretary Ganesh Bhakta Shrestha, then deputy general secretary Suman Shakya and then member Krishna Shankar Sah face arrest. The CIB has also issued arrest warrants against then chairperson of Brihaspati Vidya Sadan, Chiranjivi Tiwari, and others, including Pravin Raj Joshi, Murari Nidhi Tiwari, Abhinav Singhania and Siddharth Kedia. The arrests follow an investigation on the complaint that 29 ropanis (14,753.25 square metres) of land belonging to the children’s organisation had been illegally leased out to Brihaspati Vidya Sadan school for Rs9 million a year. The school is known to have sub-leased five ropanis (2,543.66 square metres) to Rai School at a rate of Rs6 million a year. The land was leased to Brihaspati Vidya Sadan for 59 years in various instalments since 1992, when Vaidya was the organisation’s chairperson. Under his leadership, the organisation in 2015 leased the land to Brihaspati Vidya Sadan for another 43 years through a sub-lease deal 16 years before the existing lease expired. Brihaspati Vidya Sadan had also allegedly used the government land illegally to take a loan of Rs313.3 million. The Nepal Children’s Organization had on April 27 scrapped the lease deal and subsequently filed a case with the CIB against the individuals signing the lease as well as against the proprietors of Brihaspati Vidya Sadan.Illegality of the lease apart, what is disturbing about the children organisation’s lease scam is that private entities have used the support system for the disadvantaged and orphan children to accumulate capital. Bishal Group, the mother organisation of the school that took the land on lease, even planned to build a 10-storey business complex on the land before it was stalled at the lawmakers’ intervention. Even as the children in the orphanage live substandard lives, the property at a prime location in Kathmandu continues to be misused. The arrest warrants, therefore, are a big step towards reclaiming the land that rightly belongs to the organisation and, by extension, the children.Moreover, the children organisation’s lease scam is a disturbing reminder of other major land grab scams that have grabbed public attention over the past few years—those related to the Lalita Niwas and the Bansbari Chhala Jutta. Huge portions of both these public properties have over the decades been illegally transferred to private individuals and entities, often in collusion with government officials. There certainly are many more such cases of illegal land grabs across the country, and the government should work aggressively to get such properties back. Further, the media’s reporting on the Nepal Children's Organization, the Lalita Niwas and the Bansbari Chhala Jutta land grab scams have been laudable—in the true spirit of a public watchdog. There should be no let-up in this.  \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   \nThe budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nPeople lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. \nThe third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit starts today. At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepal’s political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investors—from India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Group—were interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Let’s invest in Nepal. \nPolitical parties’ unhealthy activities to form provincial governments has taken the form of an ugly competition and increased the public’s frustration with the provinces. Separately, leaders of major political parties have started to blame the mixed electoral system for Nepal’s perpetual instability. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to political analyst Tula Narayan Shah to discuss these and other related issues.Nepali politics has entered yet another phase of endless bickering over power after the March 4 change of the ruling coalition. Politicians have resorted to every possible tactic to get leadership in provincial governments. How do you analyse this trend?I am not surprised. It is natural in the kind of parliamentary system that we practise. We adopted the parliamentary model in federal and provincial levels while the one at our local level is similar to the presidential system. Local unit chiefs and deputies are elected directly by the people and they can serve five-year terms. That has ensured stability there. Provincial governments on the other hand are destabilised when there is any change at the centre.Leaders have started blaming the electoral system for hung parliaments and instability. Is the problem in the system or with our leaders?Some senior leaders in major parties now blame the electoral system. Even the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Office of the Auditor General have recommended changes in the electoral model, arguing that the current one had promoted corruption in the country. I am not convinced. Politicians argue that no political party could garner a majority in this system and that led to instability. I rather hold politicians’ personal ambition and corrupt political culture responsible. General secretary of a major political party recently argued that it will be better for national politics to be driven by two political parties. Nepal conducted eight general elections (in 1959, in 1991, in 1994, in 1999, in 2008, in 2013, in 2017 and in 2022) under a multi-party system. Forget the 1959 polls. Of the three polls held in the 1990s, the Nepali Congress got majority in 1991 and 1999. Also, during those years, two parties—the Congress and the CPN-UML—dominated Nepali politics. Did a single-party majority and dominance of two parties provide stability? Not at all. Rather, personal rivalries of the Congress leaders invited instability. Fast forward to 2017 elections. The UML and the Maoist Centre formed an alliance and jointly fought elections. They later merged to form the Nepal Communist Party, which had a comfortable majority. Again the rivalry of the top leaders within the party caused instability. These instances show that a majority for a single party doesn’t necessarily translate into stability.I rather see a conspiracy behind blaming the electoral system. In the 1990s, Nepal adopted the first-past-the-post system to elect all lawmakers. Around 70 percent national seats were controlled by two castes—Brahmin and Chhetri. In 2008, we adopted a mixed electoral system, which was a demand of the 2006 people’s movement, the Maoist insurgency and the Madhesh agitation. The proportional representation category significantly increased representation of women, dalits, Madheshi and indigenous communities in the legislature, whereas the representation of the males of Khas-Arya groups, who were historically ruling the country, decreased drastically.Who are those elected the most under the FPTP system?The FPTP electoral system has certain attributes that are more conducive to some groups than others. ‘High-caste males’ win more elections. Females have less of a chance. But dalits also have less chance even if the candidate is male. Those like contractors, landlords and businesspeople who can freely spend win elections. Likewise, those who are well-connected with the power centres in Kathmandu can influence elections. Chhetris and Thakuris were dominant in Panchayat politics. Brahmins got stronger after the 1990 political change. Also those who have access and visibility in media and other public forums have better chances of being elected under the FPTP.Some leaders who have these capabilities have won elections in different systems. There is one Madheshi leader, who won election in Panchayat, got tickets from Congress and won again in the multiparty system. Later he joined a Madhesh-based party and won. So, high-caste males and those with access to power corridors in Kathmandu want FPTP. Whereas, women, dalits and those from marginalised communities prefer PR.A general perception is that those who are directly elected are competent ones and can deliver whereas those from the PR category are there just for the sake of representation. Do you agree?Leaders didn’t pick the candidates properly under the PR category. They picked their loved or loyal ones or sold these seats for hefty monetary returns. Leaders from Madheshi and indigenous communities fought for this system. But the same Madheshi leaders kept the names of their wives, daughters and other family members at the top of the PR list. Thus leaders misused and defamed the electoral system. So, the debate should be focused on correcting the wrong practices, not scrapping the system itself.Provinces replicated all the wrong practices of the centre and did even worse.We adopted the same parliamentary system in provinces. So the same thing happened there. Conversely, local units are different as the system there is different. Therefore, we have to go for directly elected executive heads at the centre as well as provinces. Let’s elect the prime minister and chief ministers directly. That will give us stability. Senior leaders from the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre have proposed changing the electoral system but they haven’t proposed direct election of the prime minister and chief ministers. So, the solution is direct election of executive heads, as in Palikas. Scrapping of the PR system won’t help.What if a wrong person gets elected to the post and can’t be removed for five years?In a democracy, you have to trust the people. Nepali citizens are the ones who removed monarchy. Can’t they unseat a leader elected by their votes? In a direct election, even a person from outside the political parties may emerge. So, politicians are afraid because traditionally they exert control over candidacy and various other things through the parties. Many think of provinces as an unnecessary burden on state coffers. Is that the case?I don’t think so. State restructuring was one of the major demands of the Maoist insurgency, Madhesh movement and the 2006 People’s Movement. Why did they ask for it? Because Nepal was a heavily centralised state and it wasn’t inclusive. Federalisation of the state, inclusive electoral system and reservation quotas in civil service were the three components of state restructuring.But why did the provinces then fail to deliver and win public trust?The stakeholders spent around a decade deciding what type of provinces should be carved out. Even pro-federalists didn’t debate how to make the provinces functional. Those who lobbied in favour of the federal system have now become defensive. Some are silent. The political party [which is led by Upendra Yadav] that fought for the federal system has been leading the government in Madhesh for the past six years. But they haven’t given any relief to the common people through the provincial government. People have an impression that the provincial system has added corruption and it is only for the leaders and their cronies, not the common people.Are the leaders really corrupt or do they lack efficiency?Even the Maoist and Madheshi parties that promised to be different to the Congress and the UML couldn’t come up with a roadmap to make the federal system and state agencies more meaningful for the people. They only indulged in power politics, just like other parties. That frustrated the people.You recently travelled to various parts of Madhesh province. How are the sub-national administrations working and what is the public mood there?A society where people are aware, educated and active helps make leaders as well as administration accountable. Authorities are found to be working arbitrarily in the places where people can’t question their wrongdoing. We find relatively better administration in the mid-hill regions, where Brahmins and Chhetris have dominant presence as they have better understanding of the system, laws and other information. Such a mid-hill area expands from the eastern border to Lumbini Province. In this belt, people can raise questions and make the administration accountable. Women’s status is better while caste-based discrimination is less. Local units, schools, health posts, and administrative units work well. Conversely, these aspects are weak in Karnali, Sudurpaschim, inner Madhesh and in the northern belt as there is no critical mass capable of questioning the authorities.You should understand that there are two Madhesh belts. One is along the East-West Highway, second is the bordering area. The belt along the highway has a diverse social composition. There is dominance of the people who migrated from the hills. Development indicators are better and so is the presence of state agencies. The more you move south, the more you find homogenous populations of Madheshi origin. Traditional power relations haven’t changed there. Patron-client dynamics still stand. Certain individuals have key roles in elections and other important activities. They take the decision on behalf of other common people. We find similar practice in the northern belt as well but not in the mid-hill and highway areas.Many say local units perform better than provinces. What is the perception on the ground?Local level is equipped with needed authority. Provinces should be given powers to make them effective as per the spirit of federalism. The present system was designed by reluctant federalists. Therefore, what we need is a fresh debate on the reforms of provinces. There are two conflicting claims. A section of the society says provinces have misused their authority and failed to deliver. Others say the provinces need more authority for effective functioning.It is true that provinces have failed to use the authority they have. Provinces have their legislatures that prepare their budgets and their governments can implement it. Give me an example of an exemplary and innovative initiative taken by any of the seven provinces in the past six years. Madhesh Province started the ‘Beti Padhau Beti Bachau’ campaign but corruption doomed it. People started raising questions, “why do we need provinces, if the leaders there are to copy the same corrupt activities of the centre?”Madheshi leaders opposed the hill people’s dominance and discriminatory practices in the central administration. But the same Madheshi leaders aren’t promoting an inclusive system in Madhesh. Around 20 percent of the total Madhesh population are dalits. The government in the province has changed multiple times. But how many dalits have been ministers in the provincial Cabinets? There are 136 local units in Madhesh Province. But only one mayor and two deputy-mayors are from the dalit community. Just like a set of elite people has captured Kathmandu’s politics, another set of elites has captured the politics of Janakpur.How do Madheshi people look at provinces?People in Kathmandu, mid-hills, and some other places can be heard saying provinces should be scrapped. Common people in Madhesh don’t say so. But they have dissatisfaction with the parties who championed the federal system. They say, “our lives are the same even in the federal system”.How do you analyse the performance of two new parties in Madhesh—Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti?Overall, three parties emerged from the 2022 elections. The Rastriya Swatantra Party emerged from the areas with a dominant presence of hill people. The Janamat Party won from eastern Tarai and the Nagarik Unmukti Party from the western part of the southern belt. The Janamat says the agenda of discrimination against Madhesh is still relevant but they oppose the leadership of the Janata Samajbadi Party and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The old Madheshi parties spoke against Kathmandu’s discrimination but they themselves didn’t work to remove discrimination when they led the government in Madhesh. Besides, they didn’t speak against bad governance. Now, the Janamat’s agenda is to fight discrimination and bad governance, both by Kathmandu as well as the old Madheshi parties.The RSP’s emergence is against “the bad governance of the Congress and the UML”. Its major agenda is good governance. It doesn’t care about discrimination. But bad governance isn’t an agenda of Nagarik Unmukti. The party that emerged mainly after the Tikapur incident is against the discrimination of Tharu community. The dispute in the party is family-based and the outfit hasn’t taken the form of a political party. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nOur attention has been drawn to a news report published by The Kathmandu Post regarding our operations in Helambu (‘Helambu administration says Melamchi project didn’t pay promised tax’, March 31).Quoting the rural municipality, the paper writes, ‘Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, the Chinese contractor company of the project, has not paid for the resources—slates, stones, soils and other riverbed materials—used while constructing Ambathan dam and other infrastructures in Helambu Rural Municipality Ward No 1.’ Our main objection goes with this sentence of the news. Sinohydro began completing the uncompleted infrastructures of the Melamchi Water Supply Project after making a formal agreement with the concerned agencies of the Government of Nepal. We have signed the terms and conditions and we assure you that we abide by the clauses mentioned in the agreement. As a construction company, we managed construction materials from different legal sources. Some materials were imported from foreign countries while some of them were purchased locally and also some of them is recycling of discarded bulk rock and soil from the tunnel or dam excavation period. As mentioned in the news, the company used slates, stones, soil and other riverbed materials in the infrastructure, but all these materials were used under construction for three major purposes. The first one is aggregate used for mixing concrete and backfill work which were legally bought from local vendors and suppliers with fully paid taxes. The second one is backfill stone used for gabion wall work. The last one is the hard stone used for laying weir lining. The latter two were recycled excavated mucking rock heaped up in the construction field rather than the river bed materials. For the aggregate, the company has paid all the vendors and suppliers for the materials they supplied and we believe that all of the vendors and suppliers are satisfied with the company. The entire bill, invoices, payment receipts, dispatches and all other documents of transactions and payments concerning the local and the foreign vendors and suppliers are transparent, and are kept safely in the company’s office. The news report is misleading, and should be amended.Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, via email \nWe understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019. Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal \nI am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25). I would like to add that much of what we achieved at SOAS University of London would not have been possible without the contribution of my colleague Krishna Pradhan. Pradhan taught Nepali at SOAS for 15 years until his own early retirement in 2019, and was greatly admired by the many students who learned so much from him. His presence at SOAS also enabled me to develop courses in Nepali literature, history and culture alongside the essential language courses. Sadly, none of this will be available to future generations of students in the UK.Michael Hutt,Emeritus Professor of Nepali and Himalayan Studies,SOAS, University of London \nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.
