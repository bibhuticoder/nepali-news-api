Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe ruling and opposition parties seem to be drifting further apart over the issue of investigating the cooperatives scam as leaders from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Nepali Congress compete in making personal accusations against each other.A meeting of the top leaders of the major ruling and opposition parties on Saturday evening had in principle agreed to constitute a parliamentary panel to investigate the scam. As per their agreement, a four-member committee led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, who also is a CPN-UML leader, was formed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the parliamentary probe. The committee also includes Jeevan Pariyar from the Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the UML, and Shishir Khanal of the RSP. However, marathon meetings by the Giri-led panel starting Sunday morning could not agree on the ToR as the ruling parties stuck to their guns. The main opposition insisted that the investigation against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the primary focus of the probe panel. The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the RSP chair.“We don’t want the committee just for the sake of forming one. It needs to investigate what we are pressing for,” said Ramesh Lekhak, Nepali Congress chief whip. “The ruling parties want a probe panel with a broader objective, without investigating the home minister.” The ruling party leaders, however, say the Congress wants to form the committee with the objective of implicating a particular person (Lamichhane). “The sole objective of the Congress is to target an individual, which is not acceptable. Their demand has nothing to do with resolving the problems in the cooperative sector but only with implicating the home minister,” said the UML’s Bartaula.RSP leaders say they were even flexible about including (Lamichhane-linked) Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation, but only if the Congress agrees to allow the probe committee to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden. “However, the Congress leaders didn’t agree. They backtracked from Saturday's agreement,” said the RSP’s Khanal. As the parties were in negotiations to finalise the ToR, a meeting of the House of Representatives called for 11 in the morning was postponed to 2 pm, which was again postponed to 4 pm. With no agreement in sight, the House meeting finally commenced at 6 in the evening with the single agenda of allowing Lamichhane to clarify the accusations against him.A meeting of the opposition parties held earlier in the morning had agreed to allow the home minister to answer questions raised against him, a chance he had long been asking for. The meeting called by the Congress was attended by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The opposition parties, particularly the Congress, which had been barring Lamichhane from addressing the House and presenting bills, had agreed to allow him to clarify the matter. Addressing the House after more than two months, Lamichhane not only defended himself, but also launched a personal attacks on several Congress leaders. Daring anyone to present concrete evidence of fraud, he said, “I challenge anyone to show evidence that any decision was made to acquire a loan from cooperatives, that I submitted any loan applications or signatures during the loan process, or that any funds were deposited into my account during my tenure at Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd.” He claimed that fake loan statements were prepared in the cooperatives in his name, for which he is not responsible. “I haven’t signed any documents nor have I been on their boards or served in official capacity in any of the cooperatives. Never ever did the Gorkha Media decide to take loans from cooperatives,” he said. “I am not responsible to clear the filth created by [then Gorkha Media chair] GB Rai.” He said he has been hounded based on the sensational media headlines targeting him. Lamichhane also lashed out at the Nepali Congress, revealing that the party had offered him the prime ministerial position for a term of a year and a half. He questioned the party's moral stance, wondering why they considered him unfit for the role of home minister yet found him suitable for prime minister.“If I am ineligible to serve as home minister, with what moral justification do I assume the post of prime minister? I wish to raise this question in the House today. Is the offer for the prime ministerial position still valid, or has it lapsed?” said Lamichhane.He asked if the Congress was ready to constitute a probe panel against everyone the media has linked with corruption. Without naming Gagan Thapa, the Congress general secretary, Lamichhane accused him of selling the country's secret information to foreigners. Citing media reports, he also claimed that Thapa had embezzled millions of rupees in the name of constructing a park at Tri-Chandra College and had misused agricultural grants. He also asked whether the main opposition would want a probe panel against those who have been accused of grabbing the land of Bansbari Leather and Shoe Factory, illegally registering public land in Tikapur under individuals’ name, and stealing luxury watches, or selling diplomatic passports. “Not just those who hold two or three citizenship, the agents and assets of the foreigners who hold one citizenship and one passport but sell the country’s secret information must be ousted as the lawmaker,” he said.In response, the Congress leaders said Lamichhane was rattled by the demands to investigate him. Holding a press meet after the House meeting, Congress leader Thapa said not just Lamichhane but his larger team is also involved in the embezzlement of savings from cooperatives. “It seems they [Lamichhane and other RSP leaders] are trying their luck at running a political party having already operated cooperatives and a media company,” he said. Stating that such committees have been constituted in the past, Thapa said if Ram Sharan Mahat, Bharat Mohan Adhikari or Janardan Sharma can be investigated, why not Lamichhane. He also challenged the home minister to uncover any wrongdoing on his part. “If I am guilty, I need to face legal action. If he is guilty he has to go through the same process,” he said asking Lamichhane why he fears investigations.Thapa challenged the home minister to investigate his entire life, starting from his birth in Prasuti Griha [maternity hospital] in Kathmandu. “Look at the kinds of allegations he [Lamichhane] has levelled against me. I request him: Please form a committee to probe me… Such a committee to probe Gagan Thapa can be formed even within the RSP. Please do it.”Thapa said his party primarily wants an investigation into the embezzlement of money in the cooperatives with Lamichhane’s involvement as they believe that police have been barred from investigating them.“We are clear the House cannot function until a probe committee is formed as per our demand. The vote of trust motion will also not move ahead so long as the committee is not formed,\" said Thapa.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take a vote of trust from the lower house on Monday. However, lack of agreement among the parties has put it into uncertainty. “We will try to agree on the ToR on Monday morning. Even if we can’t come to an agreement, the Congress should allow the vote on the trust motion as it is being done as per a constitutional obligation,” said Bartaula. \nJanata Samajbadi Party (JSP) Nepal President Upendra Yadav filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court on Sunday demanding that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s vote of confidence motion be stopped.The main opposition Nepali Congress permitting, Dahal is set to seek a floor test on Monday for the fourth time since becoming prime minister on December 25, 2022. Govinda Prasad Ghimire, the Supreme Court’s information officer, said JSP-Nepal chair Yadav filed a petition against the trust motion in Parliament. “In his petition, Yadav claims that holding a vote of confidence in Parliament will not be valid at a time when the dispute between his party and the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party has not been resolved,” Ghimire told the Post.Yadav, in his petition, also claimed that the seven lawmakers who defected to the Rai-led JSP are ineligible to vote in Parliament, arguing that they are partyless. The court has scheduled a hearing on the petition for Monday.Yadav also submitted an application to Speaker Devraj Ghimire on Sunday urging him not to include the seven lawmakers in the process to conduct the vote of confidence.Earlier, the JSP-Nepal moved the Supreme Court against the Election Commission’s decision to register the splinter group. Hearing the petition, the top court on May 15 ordered that the new party registration process be put on hold. A hearing on whether to issue an interim order will be decided in the hearing scheduled for Tuesday.The Election Commission registered the Ashok Rai-led group as Janata Samajbadi Party on May 6. On May 5, Rai, along with six other lawmakers and 30 central committee members of the party, quit the JSP-Nepal to form the new party.Officials at the election body said that the Rai-led party was recognised in accordance with the Political Parties Act 2017 and registered according to Section 33 of the Act and Rule 5 of the Regulations on Political Parties 2017. However, an ordinance had nullified the Act three years ago. “The party was recognised based on the regulations related to the Political Parties Act, a regulation that has already been withdrawn. Thus the party lawmakers cannot give the vote of confidence in Parliament,” Tejman Shrestha, assistant professor of Nepal Law Campus, told the Post. “As the Supreme Court has also ordered to maintain the status quo in the party, lawmakers of the new party will be obliged to follow the whip of the mother party should they vote in Parliament.”However, former attorney general Mukti Pradhan said the court’s order to maintain the status quo in the party’s division does not necessarily mean the lawmakers should follow the whip issued by the Yadav-led party.“The court has not questioned the legitimacy of the lawmakers,” Pradhan told the Post. “Lawmakers of the splinter faction have a right to vote for the prime minister if they want.”JSP-Nepal, led by Yadav, withdrew its support to the Dahal government on May 13, accusing the major coalition partner of engineering the party’s split. Before pulling the plug on the government, party chief Yadav was the deputy prime minister and minister for health and population. Prime Minister Dahal decided to seek a vote of confidence in the House after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support. Without the splinter faction, the JSP-Nepal commands five lawmakers in the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Dahal, chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), on March 4 broke the year-long alliance with the Nepali Congress and joined hands with the CPN-UML. He also brought the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal), and the CPN (Unified Socialist) Party on board. Dahal earlier tested the floor on March 13, and got 157 votes in his favour.However, legal experts have differing interpretations of the prime minister’s decision to seek a trust vote. “When a prime minister commands the majority in Parliament even after a coalition partner withdraws support, it is not necessary to seek a vote of confidence,” former attorney general Raman Shrestha, who is close to the Maoist Centre, told the Post. But assistant professor Tejman Shrestha disagrees. “The constitution has a clear provision that the prime minister must seek a vote of confidence when a coalition partner withdraws its support,” he told the Post. Article 100 (2) of the constitution states that “if the political party which the prime minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition government withdraws its support, the prime minister shall table a motion in the House of Representatives for a vote of confidence within 30 days.”The Supreme Court's verdict regarding the split in the JSP-Nepal may turn out to be in favour of the government or against it. Therefore, the prime minister is seeking a vote of confidence before the verdict, says Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science. “If the prime minister wins the vote of trust on Monday, he will get another 30 days for political manoeuvring even if he needs to win a vote of confidence yet again,” Pokharel told the Post. But political analyst Jhalak Subedi doesn’t buy the argument. “If the prime minister loses support in Parliament, he will still have 30 days to show his majority,” Subedi told the Post. “So the ruling coalition’s possible concern is not only a Supreme Court verdict on the JSP-Nepal split.”Subedi said the ruling coalition may be looking to present the budget through an ordinance as the main opposition has been obstructing the parliamentary proceedings.“A prime minister who has just secured the vote of trust from Parliament will have more political capital to bring the budget through an ordinance,” Subedi added. “This might also be the reason for his haste.”Manish Kumar Suman, the JSP-Nepal spokesperson, said his party will vote against the prime minister. “Our party will not vote for a leader who engineered our party’s split,” he told the Post.Pradeep Yadav, a leader of the splinter faction and newly appointed minister for health and population in the Dahal Cabinet, said that the seven lawmakers of the new outfit will vote for the prime minister on Monday.“Upendra Yadav has challenged our legitimacy as lawmakers. We will also challenge him in court on Monday morning, but his challenge will not prevent us from voting for the prime minister.”Political analyst Pokharel also interpreted the prime minister’s decision to go for the floor test again as a strategic move.“It would be difficult for the Congress, the party that claims to be the champion of parliamentary practice in Nepal, to obstruct Parliament when the prime minister wants a floor test,” Pokharel said.The Congress on May 14 had lifted its obstruction of Parliament for a day to allow President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes.  \nBindra Devi Pariyar, a 45-year-old woman from ward 1 of Birendranagar Municipality in Surkhet, still remembers the pain and suffering she received seven years ago while working abroad.Pariyar’s life took a drastic turn after a flood in the Dhodekhali stream swept away her house in the monsoon of 2014.Pariyar said that her whole life turned upside down after the flood, resulting in her family being buried in debt.“After the flood, my husband, two daughters, a son, and my mother-in-law started living in a rented apartment with no money or valuables. Due to the disaster, we were unable to pay our home loan. Also, my husband and mother-in-law were struggling with illnesses. So I decided to go abroad,” said Pariyar.Under the false promises of an agent, she was convinced of lucrative prospects in Kuwait, although it is banned for Nepali women workers for employment. She had a loan of Rs1.5 million including the money she borrowed from loan sharks to go abroad.In June 2016, Pariyar was taken to Jhapa and from there to New Delhi (India), Bahrain, Dubai (UAE), and then to Kuwait illegally. Due to continued travel, jet lag, and other health issues, she was unable to eat or sleep for days upon reaching Kuwait, but she continued working there.“In Kuwait, I was tortured physically and mentally to the point that I even contemplated killing myself, but the thought of my family back home kept me going. I worked there for some two months, but they did not pay me,” said Pariyar.After some time, she fell seriously ill and was unable to work. Her employers kicked her out without paying and handed her back to the agent.When she was unable to work, the employers used to even pour hot, boiling water on her and lock her in a cage.The agent demanded some Rs400,000 to let her return home to Nepal.“I managed to get in touch with some other women who had gone to Kuwait illegally, and along with them, we contacted the Nepali embassy, and we were rescued. After completing the legal procedures, I and two other women spent ten days in Kuwaiti prison before returning to Nepal,” Pariyar added.Pariyar, who went abroad in June 2016, only came back to Nepal in March 2017 and is still struggling to repay the loans. Her husband died, and her mother-in-law is paralysed. Now her 19-year-old son is supporting the family by quitting his studies.Pariyar further added that nobody, especially women, should go abroad illegally. If anything goes wrong, they will find themselves helpless in a foreign land with nobody to help.Basanti Pant Karki, a 45-year-old woman from ward 9 of Birendranagar Municipality, legally went to Saudi Arabia in April 2016 and worked there for five years. Karki still vividly recalls the trauma and suffering she suffered in Saudi Arabia.“I used to work as a cleaner in a hospital there, and the job was also good, but the agent who took me there was an evil man; he would force me to work extra hours without any pay and frequently threatened me,” said Karki.After a year, Karki’s husband died in Nepal. When she got the news, she wanted to come back, but the agent did not allow her to leave. Later, she contacted the Nepal embassy in Saudi Arabia and requested assistance to return, but that also did not work.Karki could return home only after a year of her husband’s death.“The agent did not pay my dues but only handed me two tickets—one to go to Nepal and another to return to Saudi Arabia. He threatened me that I would not receive my payment unless I returned to Saudi Arabia. So I returned, after spending two months in Birendranagar,” said Karki. “Even those women who go to Gulf countries legally face physical and mental abuse. I advise all women planning to go to Gulf countries to find a job in Nepal itself, because those countries are not safe for foreign women,” Karki added. According to the Labour and Employment Office, Karnali Province, 4,587 women in the province have received work permits for foreign employment in the last three years.The office has no data on the number of women from the province who went to India and third countries for employment. \nAt Shanti Vatika, Ratnapark, underneath a tent barely keeping out the midday summer sun, people with disabilities are seen huddled together. It’s been 20 days since the protesters asked for a few simple things—mainly that personal assistant services be provided to those who need them.Personal assistant services involve help for people with disabilities in their day-to-day activities. From helping them to shower and dress-up, to driving them around—these services play a vital role in improving the quality of life of people with disabilities.In the ongoing protests at Ratnapark, people with all kinds of disability—wheelchair users, deafblind people, visually and hearing impaired individuals—have made their appearance. And things are looking bleak, especially after the police used excessive force on those coming out on the streets to demonstrate. Bhojraj Shrestha, a wheelchair user, has been part of the protest since day one. Everyday he wonders when he’ll get adequate help to perform simple day-to-day activities. Once he wakes up, he needs to get in his wheelchair, shower, and go out of the house to work. To do all that, he needs help and care. But that help has not been coming, at least not from the government.“Our rights are already enshrined in the law, but what’s the point when there is no implementation?” says Shrestha. The protesters’ demands include provision of personal assistant services in the upcoming fiscal budget to meet the needs and requirements of persons with disabilities. According to Chapter 3, section 9(2) of the Act relating to the rights of Persons with Disabilities, “The persons with disabilities shall have the right to obtain assistive materials and community assistance in order to earn the living respectfully.”The protesters want this right honoured. Lhakpa Nuru Sherpa is the father to a 15-year-old deafblind boy. The family looks after their son, but it isn’t always easy. The son has the right to education as any other child, but when getting him ready for school is so difficult, how is he supposed to enjoy that basic right?“If the government gives us a helper, my son can go to school more easily and enjoy his other rights. A personal caregiver and assistance is all we ask for, which would make a world of difference,” says Sherpa.To make matters worse, on May 15, the police used excessive force on the protesters as they marched from Ratnapark to Maitighar.Bhojraj Shrestha, the wheelchair user, was present that day amid the heckling police officers. The fact that the police had to use force against protesters who were only asking for the fulfilment of their rights enshrined in the constitution confounds him.Sherpa was among the protesters hounded by the police on May 15. Gashes line his arms and hands.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) condemned the excess use of force while trying to crowd control and manage traffic. Among the protesters, 20 were arrested, and seven hospitalised. Ramesh Khadka, a hearing and speech impaired person, needed a CT scan after his neck was bruised, a police constable kicked a woman with disability in her stomach, while the police heckled a 15-year-old deafblind boy on the assumption that he was faking his disability.SSP Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for the Nepal Police, said crowd control and management is part of police duty but the goal is to lead the protesters through certain routes to prevent trouble for passerby and vehicles.“The problems that occurred were the result of trying to control the crowd during the protest. The police don't use such violence especially against people with disabilities,” Karki said.However, protesters, as well as the NHRC, spoke of unwanted police violence.Bikash Thapa, an organiser of the Disability Rights Implementation Street Movement Struggle Committee, says all the protesters are looking for is for their rights enshrined in the constitution to be honoured.“Why are the police preventing us from exercising our right to protest?” says Thapa.Despite what happened that day, the protesters are prepared to continue their fight for justice.The Ministry of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens says the protesters’ demands have already been processed and sent to the Ministry of Finance. The proposal requires the finance ministry’s nod as personal assistance providers for people with disabilities have to be paid.Sherpa believes that with adequate opportunities, and means to exercise them, people with disabilities can excel in life. “The government needs to stop viewing people with disabilities as a burden,” Sherpa says. “After all, we will use the care provided by the government to improve our personal lives and to contribute to the country as a whole.” On May 20, the protesters are preparing for a huge rally with expected participation of people with disabilities from all over Nepal. \nAs India reports an outbreak of West Nile virus, Nepal’s Ministry of Health and Population said it has been assessing the risk of the deadly disease in the country.Nepal is facing a high risk of several vector-borne diseases, including the outbreak of West Nile fever, due to rising temperatures, looming monsoon, the presence of virus-spreading vectors in the country, and free movement of people between the two countries, officials said.“We are aware of the outbreak of West Nile fever in India,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “International Health Regulations also require us to increase our vigilance against the disease.”West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted to humans and animals through the bite of an infected Culex mosquito. The same vector also spreads elephantiasis or filariasis and Japanese encephalitis.Experts say mosquitoes become infected after feeding on infected birds, especially crows. When the infected mosquitoes bite humans and animals, they spread the virus, which can cause neurological problems and death in infected persons. India has reported a death from the West Nile virus in Kerala and six other cases of infections in Thrissur, Malappuram and Kozhikode districts in recent days. Ojha said that Nepal is a member state of the World Health Organisation and receives every alert issued under the International Health Regulations. “Nepal is in the high-risk zone for an outbreak of the West Nile Virus due to its climate, presence of virus spreading vector, and mobility of people to and from the high-risk zones,” said Ojha. At least two cases of West Nile Virus infection were reported in a study carried out in Nepal in 2009-2010. Of 2,046 serum samples tested to examine the virus, two samples contained fragments of the genome resembling virus lineage 1.Experts say there is no specific treatment for West Nile virus. They suggest drinking plenty of water and fluids, resting, and taking medicine for fever in mild cases. “Those experiencing severe headache, high fever, weakness and confusion should see the doctor at the earliest,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “As mosquito breeding season has started, one should also take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.”Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis, as multiple studies have pointed out. The United Nations’s report “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases affected by climate drivers have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also reveals that the warming climate has caused the Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes mosquitos to move to altitudes above 2,000 metres in Nepal. This shift in their distribution has serious implications, as over 100 species of Anopheles transmit malaria, more than 950 species of Aedes spread diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile virus, and over 1,000 species of Culex transmit Japanese encephalitis, filariasis, and West Nile virus.Vector-borne diseases, or VBDs, are spread by carriers like mosquitoes, sandflies, kissing bugs, and ticks. The report says that viruses like dengue, chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal's hilly and mountainous areas.Experts say frequent movement of people is also a reason diseases are detected in new areas. When disease vectors bite an infected person, they transmit the disease, and the vectors’ entire generation gets infected.The Ministry of Health has reported over 1,000 cases of dengue infection since January, this year. \nNepali Congress Vice President and lawmaker Dhanraj Gurung wrote to Speaker Devraj Ghimire on Monday, demanding action against Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane for contempt of parliament.Gurung accused Lamichhane of attempting to defame Congress lawmakers by making false and baseless allegations and failing to adhere to the House rules.“The home minister attempted to defame Congress lawmakers by making false and baseless statements in the House of Representatives meeting on Sunday. He exaggerated issues to mislead the general public and attacked the court’s verdict,” Gurung said in the letter.“He distorted the issue of red passports, which had already been settled by the court, to create confusion among the public.”Gurung said the Minister’s ‘unethical and baseless remarks’ are tantamount to contempt of parliament. Challenging Lamichhane to substantiate his statements, Gurung demanded that action be taken against him if he failed to provide evidence.“I demand the home minister be held accountable for contempt of parliament as he failed to adhere to the conduct of a member of the House in accordance with Rule 219 of the Rules of the House of Representatives,” said Gurung.During his speech on Sunday, Home Minister Lamichhane said the media have reported on ‘misdeeds’ by Nepali Congress leaders and questioned whether parliamentary investigation committees can be formed in each of the cases made public by the media.  \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2018 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition. \nBright blue bookshelves, a sunny courtyard, and a friendly librarian—Junkiri: The Feminist Library is a vibrant and welcoming communal space located in Dhokatole, Kathmandu. Currently, it houses more than 2,500 books and has over 700 members.This library is an initiative of VOW (Voices of Women) Media that aims to increase feminist education by providing easy access to feminist literature, tools and resources to women and girls.The library initially opened on March 8, 2020, but unfortunately, due to lockdown, it had to close down just two weeks later, on March 23. However, in August 2022, the library resumed its operations, welcoming readers back once again.Libraries have never been a neutral space. They have always, in some ways, reflected the various biases, values and power structures of their communities. Not only is there a bias in the selection of library material, but there is also a bias in cataloguing and categorisation. Most notably, the Decimal Dewy System is known to have significant biases against marginalised communities. For example, pregnancy, quite outrageously, is categorised in the disease section through this system. Historically, male authors have dominated intellectual life, which is why it is so crucial to amplify the voices of women through literature and libraries that promote works written by women. Education is a site for social change and transformation, and access to feminist education is crucial in increasing feminist consciousness. In Nepal, the urgency for a feminist library is greater than ever. While progress has been made in areas such as legal reforms and women’s representation in politics, it is still difficult for many people to understand basic concepts like consent and recognition when a minor has been groomed. The victim-blaming culture has also significantly hindered progress.A feminist library serves as a beacon of change against society’s regressions that disproportionately look down on women. Junkiri, as well as VOW media, have played pivotal roles in promoting feminist pedagogy. As a free library, they promote a collaborative and participatory learning environment that values personal narratives. As a community, Junkiri not only educates young girls on topics like consent and raises awareness on feminist issues but also serves as a supportive and guiding community for its members.The library’s collection is divided into three sections: children, young adults, and adults. The children’s section features bright, colourful, and engaging graphic books that educate children about essential topics such as consent, diversity, and empathy. The young adult and adult sections also feature a diverse range of literature, including novels, research books and a selection of queer literature. At first, the library relied on door-to-door marketing around its community to secure members, but it has since expanded through word of mouth. Jenisha Niroula, a library member, says, “I love going to Junkiri because of its jolly environment, especially when they organise children’s reading circles, encouraging young minds to read. I also find many books from female writers that I cannot find elsewhere.” The library organises a reading circle featuring various children's books with around 15-20 children in the community. This fosters a reading culture and helps children bond over books.Junkiri recently organised a Feminist Writing Workshop, encouraging participants to adopt a feminist perspective in their reading analysis and writing. Sam, a library member and a workshop participant, says, “I loved the workshop experience. It was helpful to learn about the ways of critiquing articles and practising writing as a feminist. I also love spending time in the library because of its welcoming librarian and reading space at such a low price.”“A communal space where children of different class groups inter-mingle is becoming increasingly important to foster empathy and bring down the divide between the rich and poor,” says Pooja Panta, the founder of VOW Media. The lack of community spaces in Kathmandu has brought about numerous challenges, and Junkiri plays a crucial role in filling this void by not only offering a communal space but also by supporting feminist literature and amplifying the voices of female and queer authors.Junkiri also serves as an archive. Editions of decade-old Asmita Magazine stored in a box can transport readers into various times in Nepali history when feminists tirelessly advocated for rights and articulated their challenges. “It is sometimes sad to think how very little has changed, and the challenges that women face have remained the same,” says Shashikala Khadka, the librarian.Books and magazines from various time periods serve as valuable resources for young feminists. They offer insights into the nuanced challenges faced by feminists throughout history. By studying these materials, they can better understand their role in disseminating feminist knowledge in the present day.“The best thing about Junkiri is that I don’t have to explain my beliefs as it is a safe space that promotes sisterhood and supports women,” says the librarian. She also recounts instances of individuals on Twitter who resist the feminist movement in general. “Being a feminist has become increasingly villainised, with its meaning being twisted, leading many people to hesitate in identifying with the term,” she adds.Shashikala also helps curate the library. Initially, the books were sourced from donations, but the library has recently begun purchasing to add to its collection. She also stresses the need for more Nepali graphic novels for children and Nepali novels for young adults.“Change is a relay race, it does not happen overnight, but you have to lay the groundwork for the future generation to carry it forward,” Shashikala emphasises.Junkiri is changing existing structures to improve access to feminist resources and information. It stands as the go-to destination for readers seeking thought-provoking literary works while also fostering a community centred on sisterhood and empathy.Junkiri is open Tuesday through Friday (1:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.) and Saturday (10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.). The membership fee is Rs100. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Monday secured the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives.Dahal received 157 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives. One member abstained while none voted against the motion.Members of the main opposition Nepali Congress, which is the largest party in the lower house, did not participate in the voting as they were staging protests in the House. Soon after Speaker Devraj Ghimire announced commencement of the House proceedings, Congress lawmakers gathered around the well and chanted slogans demanding a probe against Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane for his alleged involvement in cooperative scam. A total of 158 lawmakers took part in the voting. The prime minister required at least 138 votes to prove majority in favour of the trust motion. The prime minister had sought the vote of confidence as per Article 100 (2) of the constitution after the Janata Samajbadi Party, Nepal withdrew its support to the government following a split on May 5.This is the fourth time Dahal secured a vote of trust in the parliament after he became prime minister in December 2022 with the support of the CPN-UML, among other parties.Dahal had gone for the floor test for the first time on January 10, 2023. He had received 268 votes then.The prime minister won the trust motion for the second time only three months later as he broke ties with the CPN-UML and forged an alliance with the Nepali Congress. He secured the support of 172 lawmakers at the time.He had to seek the vote of confidence for a third time after Congress withdrew its support to the government after Dahal again broke the alliance with Congress and joined hands with the CPN-UML and other parties on March 4.He had received 157 votes then.The next meeting of the House of Representatives has been scheduled for 11 am on Tuesday. \nDespite federalism's establishment, provinces in Nepal face challenges in governance, as evidenced by the lack of their own police forces, civil servants, and responsive national government, leading to the degradation of natural resources like the Chure region, highlighting the persistence of corrupt practices hindering trickle-down development.\nExtreme weather events, including unprecedented droughts and floods, are severely impacting Nepal's agriculture, hydropower, and water resources, threatening economic growth and poverty reduction goals.\nYoung lawyers face challenges including barriers to entry into the Bar and a lack of mentorship; the Nepal Bar Association must prioritize their needs and foster their development during its upcoming conference.\nDespite minimal government prioritization, media literacy is gradually being fostered in Nepal through efforts by NGOs, journalists, and school curricula, seeking to empower citizens with critical media analysis skills for informed decision-making and active societal engagement.\nICC prosecutor requests arrest warrants for Israeli PM Netanyahu, defense minister, and three Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes in Gaza conflict.\nNepali Congress calls for a joint party meeting to discuss latest political events, including ongoing parliamentary obstruction over the cooperative fraud case and allegations against the Speaker.\nMUMBAI/BHUBANESWAR, May 20 (Reuters) - Indians voted on Monday in the fifth phase of mammoth general elections, with film actors and sports celebrities among the thousands who turned out early in a bid to avoid scorching afternoon heat in the financial hub of Mumbai.Three hours before voting closed, about 48% of voters had cast ballots in Monday’s phase of the world’s largest election, which began on April 19, as weather officials warned of more days of heatwaves than usual through the torrid summer.Votes will be counted on June 4, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to win a rare third consecutive term.Voters at a polling station in a tiny lane in central Mumbai waited for hours in snaking queues that advanced slowly.“It is claustrophobic and people are falling sick,” said housewife Shalini Pawar, 42, who queued for three hours. One woman nearly fainted in the heat, she added, calling for authorities to provide drinking water to those waiting.Nearly a billion people are eligible to vote in India’s election, but after poor initial turnout in early phases, more exercised the franchise to take the average of the first four rounds to 66.95%, with 69% voting in the fourth phase on May 13.Monday’s phase has the fewest constituencies going to the polls, with 89.5 million voters in 49 seats.High-profile candidates in the fray included trade minister Piyush Goyal, standing from one of six seats in Mumbai, and defence minister Rajnath Singh from Lucknow, both cities where there has been poor voter turnout in the past.On Sunday, the Election Commission specifically urged residents of both cities “to erase the stigma” of urban apathy.Mumbai is also home to the Hindi film industry, popularly called Bollywood, where the voters included film stars such as Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Ranveer Singh.Still, with three hours left to the end of voting, just 36% to 39% of eligible voters had turned out across the city’s six constituencies.Gandhi family bastionsTwo boroughs of the opposition Congress party’s Nehru-Gandhi dynasty are also going to the polls in the large politically crucial northern state of Uttar Pradesh.Family scion Rahul Gandhi is contesting the seat of Raebareli, in addition to Wayanad in the south, which has already voted.Smriti Irani, Modi’s minister for women and child development, is contesting from Amethi, where she defeated Gandhi in 2019.Former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir state Omar Abdullah is contesting from Baramulla, one of three seats in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley that neighbouring Pakistan has claimed for decades and was roiled by an insurgency.Voters wanted change, said Gulzar Ahmad Naikoo, 25.“There are cases registered against them and their lives mostly revolve around police-stations,” he added. “They are in trauma and want the cases withdrawn so that they can live a normal life.”Poor voter turnout became a concern for the ruling BJP initially, and analysts believe the low numbers cast doubts on the landslide victory sought by the party and its allies.But queues lengthened outside polling booths in Mumbai and Bolangir in the eastern state of Odisha after the weather department forecast maximum temperatures to rise between 2 degrees and 4 degrees Celsius.“The BJP has not fielded the right candidate for the Lok Sabha, but we are voting ... with Modi in mind,” said 55-year-old Odisha farmer Girish Mishra, referring to the lower house of parliament.Modi, accused by opponents of targeting minority Muslims to please hardline voters, resolved in a television interview after the fourth phase to “not do Hindu-Muslim (in politics)”.He has repeatedly accused the Congress of plans to extend welfare benefits to Muslims at the expense of disadvantaged tribal groups and Hindu castes, a claim the opposition party has denied. \nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi, a hardliner long seen as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was killed in a helicopter crash in mountainous terrain near the Azerbaijan border, officials and state media said on Monday.The charred wreckage of the helicopter which crashed on Sunday carrying Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian was found early on Monday after an overnight search in blizzard conditions.“President Raisi, the foreign minister and all the passengers in the helicopter were killed in the crash,” a senior Iranian official told Reuters, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.Raisi’s death was later confirmed in a statement on social media by Vice President Mohsen Mansouri and on state television.State TV reported that images from the site showed the aircraft slammed into a mountain peak, although there was no official word on the cause of the crash.State news agency IRNA said Raisi was flying in a US-made Bell 212 helicopter.Raisi, 63, was elected president in 2021, and since taking office has ordered a tightening of morality laws, overseen a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests and pushed hard in nuclear talks with world powers.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran’s nuclear programme, had earlier sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.PRAYERS, SEARCHESRescue teams fought blizzards and difficult terrain through the night to reach the wreckage in the early hours of Monday.“With the discovery of the crash site, no signs of life have been detected among the helicopter’s passengers,” the head of Iran’s Red Crescent, Pirhossein Kolivand, told state TV.Earlier, the national broadcaster had stopped all regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country.Video showed a rescue team, wearing bright jackets and head torches, huddled around a GPS device as they searched a pitch-black mountainside on foot in a blizzard.Several countries had expressed concern and offered assistance.The White House said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on reports about the crash. China said it was deeply concerned. The European Union offered emergency satellite mapping technology.HARDLINER, POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR TO KHAMENEIThe crash comes at a time of growing dissent within Iran over an array of political, social and economic crises. Iran’s clerical rulers face international pressure over Tehran’s disputed nuclear programme and its deepening military ties with Russia during the war in Ukraine.Since Iran’s ally Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, provoking Israel’s assault on Gaza, conflagrations involving Iran-aligned groups have erupted throughout the Middle East.In Iran’s dual political system, split between the clerical establishment and the government, it is Raisi’s 85-year-old mentor Khamenei, supreme leader since 1989, who holds decision-making power on all major policies.For years many have seen Raisi as a strong contender to succeed Khamenei, who has endorsed Raisi’s main policies.Raisi’s victory in a closely managed election in 2021 brought all branches of power under the control of hardliners, after eight years when the presidency had been held by pragmatist Hassan Rouhani and a nuclear deal negotiated with powers including Washington.However, Raisi’s standing may have been dented by widespread protests against clerical rule and a failure to turn around Iran's economy, hamstrung by Western sanctions.Raisi had been at the Azerbaijani border on Sunday to inaugurate the Qiz-Qalasi Dam, a joint project. Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev, who said he had bid a “friendly farewell” to Raisi earlier in the day, offered assistance in the rescue. \nMoments after the final whistle blew on Juergen Klopp’s managerial career at Liverpool, the much-loved German encouraged the Anfield faithful to celebrate the moment, but embrace the future.Klopp flashed his huge smile throughout a long address to fans after Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in Sunday’s emotional Premier League season finale, and even led the crowd in a song for incoming manager Arne Slot, who has enormous shoes to fill.“Change is good,” the 56-year-old Klopp told the crowd. “And you never know exactly what to expect, but if you go with the right attitude into that, then everything will be fine.“What I want you to sing, I have an idea,” he added, then launched loudly into: “Arne Slot! Na, na, na, na, na!” The crowd sang along.On a day Liverpool fans had been dreading since Klopp announced in late-January he would leave at season’s end, the manager sounded genuinely happy rather than heartbroken.“It doesn’t feel like an end. It just feels like the start, because I saw today a football team playing full of talent, youth, creativity, desire, greed,” he said.“In these few weeks where I have had too much attention, I realised a lot of things. People say I turned them from doubters into believers. That’s not true.“I just said we have to. You did it. Nobody tells you to stop believing. This club is in a better moment than a long time. We have this wonderful stadium, training centre and you — the superpower of world football. Wow.”Klopp’s team, who were on course to give their manager a fairytale ending before a string of bad results last month derailed their title challenge, finished the season third in the table on 82 points, nine behind winners Manchester City and seven behind second-placed Arsenal.Klopp bade farewell to the Anfield faithful having won 305 matches, including penalty shootouts, since joining the Reds in 2015, plus seven trophies including the Champions League in 2019 and a first English League title in three decades in 2020.But he was loved as much for his charisma and passion as his on-field success and it was on full display on Sunday. He was saluted with a guard of honour in the post-game celebrations, and after pausing to wrap an emotional captain Virgil van Dijk in a bear hug, he turned and ran through it again.“It’s a very emotional day,” Van Dijk told Sky Sports. “(Klopp) deserves every bit of love that he’s getting.”Tears rolled down defender Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cheeks while the team stood arm-in-arm and the fans serenaded them with “You’ll Never Walk Alone.”“I’ve never seen or experienced someone who can inspire or motivate with a click of his fingers,” Alexander-Arnold told Sky. “If he told me today it was snowing outside, I’d believe him—that’s probably the best way of putting it.”Klopp famously introduced himself as “the normal one” in his first Liverpool press conference after his hiring, “but he’s definitely a special one for us for the players who played under his leadership,” the team’s Brazilian keeper Alisson Becker said.“His passion, his desire to win things, to achieve things... but he thinks about the personal side also, he wanted to do everything to make the players feel good to play for his team. I have so many good memories.”While Klopp’s departure announcement sent shock waves through the football world, the manager said he felt a sense of relief around his decision. His energy for the job was waning, he said. He could not do it on “three wheels.”He looks forward, he told Sunday’s crowd, to throwing his energy into being a fan.“Obviously I saw a lot of people crying and I will tonight too because I will miss people but change is good,” he said.“You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me. You go all in from the first day. You keep believing. You push the team. I’m one of you now. I love you to bits.”And before the final curtain came down on his time with the Merseyside club, Klopp ran the length of the Anfield pitch for one final round of fist pumps with the crowd, and then pointed with two thumbs to the back of his shirt, which read: “I’ll never walk alone again.” \nManchester City’s insatiable appetite for trophies spells bad news for any club hoping to break the stranglehold Pep Guardiola’s side continue to have on English football.Admirably, Arsenal pushed them very close this season but once again the sight of Guardiola’s players cavorting with the Premier League trophy was the abiding image of the final day.City’s 3-1 victory over West Ham United on Sunday took them to a place not even the great Liverpool side of the 1980s and Manchester United team of the late 1990s and 2000s inhabited.A fourth successive English league title is unprecedented and the big question is who will stop the City march.They have averaged 89.7 points in their last four title-winning seasons and, while Guardiola’s side again failed to threaten the 100 they amassed in 2017-2018, City proved that when the pressure is really on they are almost impregnable.Arsenal and Liverpool both headed City in the standings in the final months of the campaign, but the champions put together a blistering run of 19 wins and four draws since their last league defeat by Aston Villa on December 6.No one was really surprised because in 53-year-old Guardiola City have a manager obsessed with perfection.“It’s a bit demanding at times. It’s tough, but look what he’s done. He demands a lot every single day,” City’s Norwegian goal machine Erling Haaland said of playing for Guardiola. “If you don’t live up to what he expects you have a big problem.”The Spaniard has now won the Premier League title six times in his eight seasons at The Etihad Stadium and perhaps the only glimmer of hope is that he might decide to follow Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp and step away.“The reality is I am closer to leaving than staying. We have talked with the club—my feeling is that I want to stay now. I will stay next season and during the season we will talk,” the ex-Barcelona boss said. “But eight or nine years—we’ll see.”Incredibly, in the 152 Premier League matches City have played across the last four seasons, they have recorded 112 victories with just 17 defeats, racking up 372 goals.That is in a league regarded as the toughest in Europe, where the huge broadcasting deals mean all 20 clubs have the spending power to sign some of the world's best talent.“Pep Guardiola has designed a style of football that is being copied not just around this country, but all around Europe,” former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville told Sky Sports.“Most of all he is a winning machine that instils that in everybody who works with him.”City’s Belgian midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, who along with 23-year-old Phil Foden now has six Premier League titles to his name with City, explained that the secret was quite simple.“The manager sets the tone but this team we enjoy playing with each other. It is not a team with big egos,” he said.“We play around with each other we run like crazy and we just enjoy it. The enjoyment is lasting so that’s it.”It could yet get better for City, with next Saturday’s FA Cup final against Manchester United still to come, and there will be no slackening off until another trophy is in the bag and a double secured, hot on the heels of last year’s treble. \nSunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nIn June 2020, Nepal’s Parliament ratified a new political map of the country, including geographical territories that were and still remain under the control of India. While some areas in the new map, especially the Kalapani region, were already a subject of dispute between the two countries, the communist government under Khadga Prasad Oli used its two-third parliamentary majority to include areas as far as Limpiyadhura unilaterally. For those who care to look at historical evidence, Nepal had never asserted its claim over Limpiyadhura, which was a territory lost after the Sugauli treaty of 1816. It was only in context to the existing dispute over the origin of the Kali river, which forms an international boundary in the treaty, that Nepal has claimed the Kalapani region and Lipulekh as its territory. India is cognisant of Nepal’s claim, and there is a joint committee looking at these boundary claims, with dialogue also happening at the Foreign Ministry level.Oli’s move in 2020 was not sudden. He had advisors who clearly understood that Nepal did not fulfil the prerequisites for a sovereign claim over most of those territories under the international law, which mandates physical control of the territory with a resident population under active governance. In fact, the only claim that merits a mention, and which Nepal has strongly put across to India, is the credible evidence regarding Nepal governing the villages in the Kalapani region until a few decades back. Specifications of the evidence aside, what is clear is Nepal’s claims in the Kalapani region have been acknowledged by India and well-documented by the joint committee.Oli’s come-back politicsWhen Oli came to power after the 2017 elections, he was riding on the wave of hyper-nationalism he had managed to stoke in the aftermath of the 2015 Indian blockade. While the Madhesh-based parties had indeed initiated the border obstruction to pressure Kathmandu’s political centre into conceding to their demands on the new constitution, the Narendra Modi government that had just come to power in New Delhi was blamed for actively enforcing the blockade. This is a claim India continues to deny. Whatever the truth, the blockade provided an opportune moment for Oli, whose political career was ailing at the time. He not only managed to sideline his bête noire, Madhav Kumar Nepal, inside the party but he also struck a deal with politically insecure Pushpa Kamal Dahal to cobble up a two-thirds majority in the 2017 elections. What happened next has continued to haunt Nepal’s relationship with India. Oli, of all the communist leaders of his generation, best understands that if there is one issue that could mobilise the population across the country, it is our collective sense of insecurity against what we perceive to be India’s over-reach and micro-management of Nepali politics. An average Nepali consumes Indian products, watches Bollywood movies, and supports an IPL team, all the while disdaining what they consider Indian interference in Nepali affairs.To be fair, such a mindset is not uncommon in a relationship between two countries that are disproportionate in geography, demography, economy or military capability. The tendency of the political class to weaponise public sentiments and insecurity against a larger neighbour for domestic electoral politics is not uncommon either. Autocratic and populist regimes across the world have consolidated their hold over power by stoking hate or fear against a perceived enemy state, painting their domestic opposition as weak and incapable of defending national interests. The definition of the enemy state and the national interests, in such cases, are often dictated by those in power to suit their divisive politics.When Oli refused to concede party or government leadership, Pushpa Kamal Dahal wrecked the mighty two-thirds government with the help of the disgruntled Madhav Kumar Nepal faction. Nepali Congress had no issues cashing in on this division, allowing the party’s president, Sher Bahadur Deuba, to become the Prime Minister in July 2021. Upon becoming premier, Deuba and his coalition partner Dahal did all they could to normalise the relationship with New Delhi. There was little talk about the controversial map or the Eminent Persons’ Group (EPG) report, which had both become irritants in the bilateral relationship. After the 2022 elections, when Dahal became prime minister, New Delhi reciprocated by supporting Nepal’s ambitions to invest in large infrastructures and export power in the Indian market and potentially to Bangladesh. In doing so, New Delhi expected to regain some of the trust it had lost after the 2015 blockade. But Oli is a seasoned politician, a political maverick who can see two steps ahead of his competitors. He sensed Dahal’s distrust of his coalition partners, his personal anxieties and insecurity about the future of his party, which he felt was dealt an under-hand during the division of electoral seats. China, which had openly helped in cobbling up the previous left unity, has been more cautious this time. But there is plenty to read between frequent delegations shuttling between Kathmandu and Beijing over the past year. In any case, Oli convinced Dahal to leave the Nepali Congress coalition and continue in power with UML’s support, with a vague promise of a long-term (electoral) partnership. Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajwadi Party and the newly established Rastriya Swatantra Party were offered attractive cabinet positions in exchange for their support as well. Yadav, though, has left the coalition after the split of his party. Perilous brinkmanship If Pushpa Kamal Dahal believes that the UML chairman took all the trouble of bringing down the NC-led coalition just to watch the game from the sidelines, he needs to change his advisors. He may have generously allowed Dahal to continue on the throne, but it is clear who is setting the rules of the game. The recent decision by the current government to include Nepal’s new map in its currency note has Oli’s footprints all over it. However, his brinkmanship with India could have serious ramifications for the country. Not only will such misadventures jeopardise Nepal’s crucial economic interests, especially in the cross-border energy market where the private sector has invested billions of dollars, our ambition to access the trade route to Bangladesh and further east will not see the light of the day.As the war in Ukraine drags on and the conflict in Gaza worsens, Washington is already zooming out from the Indo-Pacific region. This could provide a much-needed conducive environment for a rapprochement between New Delhi and Beijing, something Indian Prime Minister Modi has hinted at recently. Nepali communists must read the changing geopolitical horizon and understand the days of playing one neighbour against the other may not last for long. Nepal is better off drawing complementarities in its relationship with the two neighbours, allowing them to compete for economic interests on its own terms.  \nClimate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, according to the latest survey report.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, was released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics. It paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say worse is yet to come.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades. Major economic sectors and essential services like health and education in Nepal have felt the repercussions of extreme weather events linked to climate change, the survey said.The statistics office said the sampling used the total number of households from the population census. In total, 6.66 million individual households were included in the frame. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from July to March 2023 among 6,508 households in 326 primary sampling units, encompassing all seven provinces. The statistics office said all the respondents were at least 45 years old and had lived in the survey area for 25 years, forming the sampling frame that included households meeting these criteria across Nepal.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Nepal’s agriculture sector is the mainstay of the country’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of the population. The sector is mainly rainfed and heavily dependent on rainfall.When the rain fails to fall, the GDP takes a tumble. This dependence makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain region (68.7 percent), hill region (50.3 percent), and Tarai region (46.3 percent) also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases. The survey report shows households in altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 metres reported emergingnew crop diseases (60.2 percent) over the last 25 years. This shows diverse factors influence the prevalence of crop diseases across diverse geographical and climatic domains.“The situation is alarming,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office.“The survey was intended to see people’s perception towards climate change, the most burning issue globally,” he said. Climate change literacy among people, mostly in rural areas, is shallow, but some exciting facts exist. “Most of the farmers surveyed are not clear whether climate change is bringing diseases and low yields, but at the same time, they have a coping mechanism knowingly or unknowingly,” said Regmi. For instance, farmers have changed the cropping pattern. “If they think rainfall will be below normal or drought, they switch to another crop.”The survey shows that 35.8 percent of the households surveyed were aware of climate change. Across all three geographical domains, the number of households unaware of climate change is significantly high, with the highest number being in the mountain region (70.9 percent). The sex-disaggregated data indicate that most male (61.3 precent) and female (74 percent) respondents were unaware of climate change impacts.The accessibility of early warning information among the people is weak.In urban municipalities, 16.3 percent of households received early-warning information, while 83.7 percent of the respondents did not receive any information regarding a disaster occurring shortly. Altitude-wise, households in low-altitude regions have received more early-warning information than those in the higher-altitude areas. The survey results show a significant impact of climate change on Nepal's water resources over the last 25 years. Climate change has notable implications for the country's energy transition, as it is actively pursuing a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources. According to experts, the survey report is eye-opening. Nepal plans to generate 30,000MW of electricity by 2035, and the market for Nepal's hydropower is opening up in India and Bangladesh.Many households reported adverse changes and noted their water resources dried up. This phenomenon was observed across all domains and indicates a nationwide decrease in water availability. Respondents experienced a reduction in ground and surface water, primarily attributed to insufficient rainfall and increased drought incidents. According to the survey, 78.3 percent of households observed a decline in rivulets and streams, and 55 percent observed a decrease in wells, springs, and stone spouts. Likewise, 47.7 percent observed changes in water resources due to insufficient rainfall, followed by an increase in drought (20.3 percent), road construction (3.4 percent), deforestation and urbanisation (3.2 percent). In contrast, minimal respondents observed change due to population growth, earthquakes and landslides/soil erosion over the last 25 years.The survey said that over the past 25 years, Nepal has suffered from various natural disasters. Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nProject Sambad, a platform for critical discussions on Nepali society and policymaking, held its first event in Kathmandu on March 14-15.\nThe Siddhartha Art Gallery's \"Sawari Kathahru: Art in Motion\" exhibition showcases the wit and creativity of truck poetry, featuring photographs, a documentary, interviews, and a table game that reflects Nepal's evolving political, religious, and social landscapes.\nParliamentary proceedings have been hindered by a widening rift between ruling and opposition parties over a probe into a cooperative scam, leaving the government facing the threat of issuing the budget through an ordinance if the impasse continues.\nNepali Congress questions Speaker's impartiality after a scuffle in Parliament, alleging biased orders from the ruling UML and suspicions of instigation by KP Oli, delaying the formation of a parliamentary committee over the cooperatives scam.\nA parliamentary meeting intended to resolve an impasse descended into a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers over the scope of a probe into Home Minister Lamichhane's alleged embezzlement.\nNepal's leading parties, CPN-UML and Nepali Congress, engage in heated exchanges over the recent Supreme Court ruling on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land swap controversy, with accusations of corruption and misconduct leveled against each other.\nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n\nA man, who was injured while putting out a fire at Tapeshwar community forest in Godawari Municipality-4, Badikhel, succumbed to burn injuries on Tuesday.According to Senior Superintended of Police Shekhar Khanal of Lalitpur District Police Range, Shankar Pahari died while undergoing treatment at the Kirtipur-based Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre.Another injured, Ramesh Pahari, is being treated at the hospital.Meanwhile, a fire at Ananda forest in Godawari Municipality-6, Lele is yet to be brought under control. A total of 65 patients have been moved to a safer place after the fire spread to the premises of the Anandaban Hospital. \nGlobal Dairy Private Limited has started commercial production of butter milk, known as mohi in Nepali.Mohi, known as mattha in Hindi, a popular fermented dairy drink originating in the Indian subcontinent, is the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream. The dairy plant in Imilia in ward 9 of Buddhabhumi Municipality in Kapilvastu district has been producing 1,000 litres of mohi daily since mid-April. The company said the demand for the drink, a good source of protein and calcium, has been growing.In Nepal, it is consumed especially during the summer. The producer said that traditionally the drink used to be a favourite in villages, but gradually lost its appeal to more popular beverages like Coca-Cola and Pepsi.“That is why we have started the production and branding of mohi,” said Thaneshwor Neupane, chairman of Global Dairy. “We are the first Nepali company to start the commercial production of bottled mohi and label it. We have introduced the product in the market with attractive packaging.”The company has expanded sales and distribution to six districts of Lumbini province. “This is our first phase of expansion. We have planned to go across Nepal,” said Neupane.The brand, ‘Buddhabhumi’, is named after the birthplace of Buddha. Shankar Pandey, finance chief of the company, said that the drinks give energy and refresh people. The retail price is Rs50 per litre bottle. The dairy factory said it has spent Rs15 on each bottle and its labelling, bringing the total cost to Rs38-40 per bottle, Pandey said.“We have given special focus to maintaining the standard and purity of mohi.”Mohi is made from curd recommended by the food technologist. First, the substance that turns milk into curd is tested. After that, the acidic and potential hydrogen levels are tested, and mohi is made only from consumable curd.The curd is then mixed with processed water in a machine until it reaches the right consistency for bottling. The finished product is packaged in sets of 12 bottles and is sent to the market based on demand.“Bottling is also nice, and the taste is also good,” said Punaram Aryal, a consumer from Imilia.The company said 28,000 litres of mohi have been sold so far since its production started last week. The mohi produced is consumable within 5-6 days from the date of manufacture.According to locals, mohi has become a great option to other cold beverages produced by multinational companies. “Public response to the product is positive and this has encouraged us,” Neupane said.The factory currently has been producing 3,000 litres of mohi daily, Neupane said.Rajendra Singh Lodh, a food technologist, said special attention has been given to the purity and quality of the product.In Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, it is also said that drinking mohi after meals makes the body healthy and active. Daily consumption of mohi boosts immunity and improves the digestive system, according to food technologists.Mohi is rich in potassium, calcium, and protein. It also gives the body freshness and hydrates it.Drinking mohi is also considered beneficial for people fighting long-term diseases.Global Dairy, which has been operating for a decade, has started producing mohi as a new product, with an investment of Rs500 million. The company, which has been producing 50,000 litres of milk daily, said it is planning to increase the capacity to 100,000 litres.It aims to produce powdered milk too.“If the marketing of mohi goes well, then it will also be a boon for dairy farmers who often face milk holidays,” said dairy farmer Shiva Gulam Kori of Budhhabhmi municipality.The company has 79 collection centres in Lumbini province and two in Sudurpaschim province, and it has 15,000 farmers associated with it. It sells dairy products by coordinating with around 500 collection centres across the province. The company has provided direct employment to 200 people.Dr Mukesh Chaudhary, the medical chief of Kapilvastu Hospital, said that mohi is more beneficial to health compared to other cold drinks. “It is important to drink mohi for vitamins D and calcium. It hydrates the body and balances the body's temperature.”    \nCimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, achieved a milestone by delivering 50 units of cutting-edge BYD electric vehicles (EVs) in a single day. The company said that on May 18, it sold 50 BYD EVs from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu. The event, filled with excitement and anticipation, witnessed the delivery of BYD ATTO 3 and BYD Dolphin EVs to eager customers, signalling a paradigm shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly transportation solutions in Nepal, the company said in a statement. In a gesture of commitment to customer satisfaction and safety, Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd also introduced the first generation BYD e6, dating back to 2017, as a dedicated roadside assistance vehicle during the handover event. This initiative underscores Cimex's unwavering dedication to providing comprehensive support and services to BYD EV owners, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable driving experience. \nInternet service providers say they are awaiting the full text of the Supreme Court’s ruling to pay the taxes they raised from the public.The service providers (ISPs) raised nearly Rs4 billion in rural telecommunications development fees and royalty charges on maintenance from the public since the fiscal year 2017-18 but did not transfer the amount to the government.The ISPs have been arguing that the former parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had ordered the fees’ waiver.On May 13, the top court scrapped the writ petition filed by Worldlink Communications and ordered the ISPs to pay the government taxes that they had raised from the public.“We will obey the Supreme Court’s verdict. As the writ petition has been scrapped, we are discussing with the Nepal Telecommunications Authority on the amount that ISPs owe to the government and the payment modality,” said Binay Bohra, owner of the Vianet internet service provider.The tug-of-war between the ISPs and the government deprived thousands of people of the service when the Indian vendor on which the ISPs rely for the Internet bandwidth suddenly severed the link for hours.On May 2, Airtel, a leading telecom provider of India, cut upstream services to Nepal after the dispute between the government and ISPs over the payment dispute remained unresolved for months. The disruption started at around 5 pm and the services were restored after around five hours.According to the Internet Service Providers Association of Nepal, Airtel provides around 70 percent of upstream services to Nepal.Airtel agreed to restore the service after the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the regulator, promised to sort out the payment issue ‘responsibly.’For nearly two years, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology has reiterated that unless the ISPs pay the due taxes, it will not recommend the foreign exchange to be made available by the Nepal Rastra Bank to the service providers so they can forward the payment to upstream service providers.The ISPs have not paid the charges as the erstwhile parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had a few years ago ordered the government to exempt them from taxes on non-telecom components like web service, co-location, hosted service, disaster recovery, managed service, data centre, and cloud service.Following the order, in a letter dated July 15, 2018, the licensing department of Nepal Telecommunication Authority wrote to the Inland Revenue Department requesting that internet service providers not be subjected to telecommunication charges for non-telecommunication services.The committee said that internet service providers do not have to pay royalties and Rural Telecommunications Development Fund charges for three fiscal years: 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20.But the auditor general brought the issue to light.Nepal's constitutional supreme audit body pointed out that such fees, which the ISPs have raised from the public, should not be waived and instructed recovery of the charges. Following this, the government wrote to the ISPs to clear the dues.The current Public Accounts Committee has ordered the government to recover the dues from the ISPs.Nepali ISPs owe Airtel more than $30 million (Rs4.3 billion). They defaulted on payments for upstream services a year ago.The Indian vendors also threatened to suspend services starting January 1 this year if Nepali ISPs failed to settle the outstanding dues. However, following a change in government, the issue remains unresolved.The ISPs’ annual transactions near Rs27 billion, with the government earning more than Rs9 billion in revenue under eight headers.Around 10.6 million people use the internet in Nepal through 20 ISPs in the country, including the state-owned Nepal Telecom. ISPs say they provide direct employment to more than 15,000 people. \nNepal’s food safety agency has banned the sales and imports of popular Indian spice brands MDH and Everest with an immediate effect, based on the findings from several countries that they contain ethylene oxide, a cancer-causing chemical. The quality watchdog has also decided to recall and seize products currently in the customs clearance process.The move follows bans by several countries, including Singapore, Hong Kong, and the Maldives, and scrutiny by the Australian authorities.“We decided to ban the spices of the two Indian companies with immediate effect based on scientific evidence from several other countries showing high levels of carcinogenic pesticide ethylene oxide in many spice mixes. This poses a cancer risk,” said Matina Joshi Vaidhya, director general of the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control.“We will allow their sale, imports and distribution once we get clearance from the manufacturing country that they are safe to consume.” Experts say the presence of ethylene oxide, which is a flammable colourless gas with a sweet odour, in the spices, is concerning, as varieties of the products of both companies are easily available in Nepal and are popular too.Ethylene oxide is primarily used to produce other chemicals, including antifreeze. In smaller amounts, it is also used as a pesticide and sterilising agent.Lymphoma and leukaemia are the cancers most frequently associated with occupational exposure to ethylene oxide. Stomach and breast cancers may also be linked to ethylene oxide exposure.Vaidhya said countries have their own acceptable limits for pesticide use. If products are found to exceed the limits set by the department, the department will direct relevant authorities to recall them from the market.The department accordingly issued a circular to agencies on Friday to recall the spices from the market. The quality watchdog has also directed the National Food and Feed Reference Laboratory to prioritise testing for ethylene oxide.Ganesh Agrawal, an official of Jay Ganapati Enterprises in Biratnagar, the distributor of Fish Curry Masala manufactured by Everest Food Products Pvt Limited, told the Post that they knew about the issue through news reports and had planned to stop selling the product. “The sales, however, are not significant.”Earlier this month, Hong Kong and Singapore banned the sale of MDH and Everest spice brands, citing the detection of carcinogenic pesticide ethylene oxide in several spice mixes.India is the world's largest spice producer, consumer and exporter. Zion Market Research estimates India's domestic spice market to be worth $10.44 billion in 2022, and the Spices Board said India exported products worth $4 billion during 2022-23.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 946.42 tonnes of various Everest brand spices from India and other countries, amounting to Rs120 million, in the last fiscal year ending mid-July 2023. Spice imports from India alone amounted to 478 tonnes worth Rs74.65 million. Similarly, the imports of the MDH brand spice amounted to 1,143.76 tonnes worth Rs637.21 million. From India alone, Nepal imported 1,141.96 tonnes of spice worth Rs635 million.Consumer rights activists say that authorities must take urgent action as the issue is related to public health.“As the products that were found to be hazardous to public health in Hong Kong and Singapore are widely available in Nepal too, it would be irresponsible to wait for a test report to prohibit their use,” Jyoti Baniya, chairman of the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights, told the Post in a recent interview.“It will be too late to wait for the report—we should not forget that this is directly linked to public health.”The quality watchdog said they have started inspecting the department stores and groceries to remove the banned spice. \nFor decades, cross-border trade between Nepal and India was traditionally done due to social ties spanning borders. The situation now is different. It’s now an organised commercial informal trade happening at a large scale, according to a research finding. Rice appears to be a key commodity ‘highly informally’ imported from India to Nepal. The research, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, shows that only 40 percent of rice is imported to Nepal from India through a formal channel.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, leading to a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports. In the current fiscal year, the government also introduced a 13 percent VAT on some vegetables, including onions and potatoes.With this variation, the price differences between Nepal and India become 18-20 percent, or rice in India becomes cheaper by at least 18 percent.The paper said that India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west. According to a separate report by the International Food Policy Research Institute, carrying or informally transferring goods has become a full-time profession for many poor families living close to the towns along the Nepal-India border.“Carriers,” many of them women, collect the goods on the Indian side and bring them in via the open border, escaping the formal customs entry points, sometimes on foot, sometimes on bicycles and motorbikes, and always at their own risk.Presenting the report titled ‘Insights into Informal Cross-Border Trade in Agri-Food Commodities in South Asia’, Dikshya Singh, programme coordinator at SAWTEE, a South Asian think tank based in Kathmandu, said the export duty imposed by India on rice in September 2022 followed by an export ban on non-basmati rice in July 2023, fueled the informal trade.The report said that rice, vegetables, chemical fertilisers, and seeds are other agricultural products and inputs that have been largely coming through informal channels.The study reveals that this informal trade is dominated by a small group of traders forming an oligopoly. Moreover, the study indicates that large-scale informal trade is controlled by mafia-style syndicates with political backing.Anand Bagaria, managing director of Nimbus Holdings, said Nepal needs proactive measures to deal with informal cross-border trade. “Since we cannot influence our neighbouring countries’ policies, Nepal needs to be clear about what could be the right balance between inflation, government revenue, and mitigating quality-related risks while dealing with informal trade.”Singh said Nepal heavily relies on informal trade to meet its need for agricultural inputs.The report attributes the illegal import of chemical fertiliser to the persistent shortage in Nepal and cheaper rates in India.The report showed that Nepal needs 800,000 tonnes of chemical fertiliser annually. The country has been able to import 400,000 tonnes formally, and an estimated 200,000 tonnes come through informal channels. According to the report, farmers in Nepal have been informally importing a variety of seeds that are not available locally, especially hybrid seeds of vegetables, mainly due to import restrictions and to avoid non-tariff requirements.SAWTEE conducted surveys at nine customs points, including Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Biratnagar, Nepalgunj, Kakarbhitta, Krishnanagar, Jaleshwar, Suthauli, Maheshpur, and Bhadrapur and the border crossings in their periphery.“The informal trade between Nepal and India is as big as formal trade,” said Paras Kharel, executive director of SAWTEE. Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary, said that gold and silver, areca (palm) nuts, onion and garlic, poppy seed, edible oil, and black pepper are informally exported to India from Nepal. “Informal trade is rising between Nepal and India because of the price differences caused mainly due tariff advantage and tariff differences and non-tariff barriers for formal export.”“The misdeclaration of exported goods from Nepal to India needs to be addressed,” he said. For instance, Nepal exports cabbage to India from Koshi province. As India has restricted the import of other types of vegetables from Nepal, traders are exporting other vegetables like okra, chayote, and chilli under the name of cabbage, Ojha said.Article 2 of the trade treaty between Nepal and India, and the agreement on cooperation to control unauthorised trade talks about controlling informal trade. “During the bilateral discussion, be it commerce level, inter-government committee meetings, or customs director-level meetings, either annually or bi-annually, they discuss informal trade. But there hasn’t been any serious discussion about controlling informal trade,” Ojha said.Nepal raised issues like the informal import of agricultural goods from India to Nepal, while the Indian side brought up issues like the informal import of goods including areca nuts, edible oil, poppy seeds, and black pepper, but no concrete solution has been found yet, according to Ojha. Sabnam Shivakoti, joint secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, pointed out that cross-border trade that was done traditionally due to social ties across borders is not the same as the organised commercial informal trade that is happening now on a large scale. “This has been affecting agricultural and industrial sectors as they have to compete with cheap imports.”According to Shivakoti, an import restriction on dairy products was announced in February 2024 to protect domestic farmers and the dairy industry, but that led to formal imports being diverted to informal channels.Trade experts said that as the Indian government is providing eight types of subsidies on agricultural products, as a result, Nepali products become less competitive even in the domestic market, raising the informal trade to Nepal. \nOver 600 people with respiratory illnesses seek care at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital on Tuesdays and Thursdays when the hospital runs its out-patient service. The number of patients suffering from respiratory illnesses—pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among others—has risen significantly not only in this hospital but those across the country, according to health officials. “Polluted air is the chief culprit for the rapid surge in the number of respiratory illnesses,” said Dr Niraj Bam, an associate professor at the Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University. “Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke.”Of late, polluted air has been taking a huge toll on public health, throughout the globe.A new report published on Thursday in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal, states that polluted air and high blood pressure are leading contributors to the global disease burden. The report, “Global Burden and Strength of Evidence for 88 Risk Factors in 204 Countries and 811 Subnational Locations, 1990–2021: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021,” shows that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent).Likewise, smoking accounted for 5.7 percent, low birth weight and short gestation 5.6 percent and diabetes 5.4 percent of the burden.Low birth weight, short gestation and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing (WaSH) were among the leading risk factors for the younger population up to 14 years, while for older age groups, metabolic risks such as high blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI), high blood sugar and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol had a greater impact.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis. Doctors say particulate matter emitted from construction sites, wildfires, wood burning, agriculture activities, and dusty roads worsens air quality, threatening the health of hundreds of thousands of people across the country.Most forests burn every year during the dry season. Vehicular and industrial emissions and the burning of agricultural residue make the air toxic.A recent report by Save the Children also shows critical linkages between air pollution and multi-faceted hazards for children.The report “Breathless Future: Unveiling the Impacts of Air Pollution on Children and Women in Kathmandu and Saptari” shows the systemic impact of air pollution on various aspects of children's lives. It also explores the effects of air pollution on women and underrepresented groups.“Deteriorating air quality, outdoors and indoors, has exposed children and women to many health hazards—asthma, other lung conditions, coughing, skin disease, nausea, and headache,” reads the report. “Alarmingly, these conditions have led to increased cases of pregnancy loss, child organ underdevelopment, and a general decline in life expectancy.”Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively.The reduction in life expectancy depends on where one lives—7.5 years in Mahottari, 7.4 years in Rautahat and Dhanusha, and 7.2 years in Sarlahi and Bara districts, the AQLI report said. Likewise, the pollution has been shaving 6.7 years off the lives of people residing in Siraha, and 6.2 years in Saptari and Rupandehi districts.Environment experts in Nepal said that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development. Polluted air has for long been taking a huge toll on public health in Nepal but what’s alarming is that the authorities have not taken the issue seriously.“We heard the government’s policies and programmes. There is no mention of the issue of air pollution,” said Bhusan Tuladhar, an environmental expert. “How can we mitigate the effects of air pollution, without addressing the problem?” \nNineteen-year-old Amit, who’s currently in his gap year, started vaping two years ago. He says he isn’t addicted to it—he barely experienced any withdrawal syndrome when he quit it last year, before picking it up again. Amit, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym to protect his privacy, says he vapes just because he wants to.Unlike Amit, Rita (name changed), who is 21, switched to vaping after smoking tobacco for a while. Rita says that since she hopes to quit smoking altogether, she doesn’t mind the Nepal government’s intention to put a blanket ban on e-cigarettes. But doctors say a ban may lead those who smoke vape to switch to smoking tobacco again.As debates continue around the world about the pros and cons of vaping compared to smoking tobacco, the Nepal government earlier this month announced that it was banning e-cigarettes. The National Health Education, Information, and Communication Center (NHEICC), under the Department of Health Services, says it is seeking help from other ministries to enforce the ban. While some vape users the Post talked to said that the ban would help them quit smoking altogether, there are other aspects of the ban that need a more careful consideration for youths’ health, experts say.Meanwhile, some other users said banning vapes makes little sense as tobacco cigarettes are still freely available in the market for people of all age groups. If the government is so concerned about youths’ health, they question, shouldn’t stricter measures be taken to ensure that minors, for instance, don’t purchase cigarettes?Nepal is not the only country to ban e-cigarettes of late. Most recently, the British prime minister announced a ban on all disposable cigarettes, citing risks to youth health following a significant rise in vaping.There are 33 countries that have altogether banned the sale of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), while according to a WHO report published in early 2024, around 74 countries have no regulations on the sale of e-cigarettes.Most countries in the world have a legal age to purchase traditional cigarettes, according to the WHO, while 88 countries have no minimum age limit to buy e-cigarettes.Moreover, the WHO has repeatedly urged countries around the globe to reduce the spread of e-cigarettes. A call to action was published in December last year, urging governments to strengthen regulations on e-cigarettes.Nepal, meanwhile, has no regulations on e-cigarettes. While they haven’t banned e-cigarettes outright, countries like China have imposed a number of regulations, including licensing to sell the products publicly, ban on flavoured products, and imposition of taxes.In a study on the prevalence of e-cigarette usage among undergraduate students in Kathmandu, 21.2 percent respondents said they never used e-cigarettes, while five percent said they currently used cigarettes. An estimation of global e-cigarette use put the number of its users at 82 million worldwide, 14.2 million of them in South Asia.Most countries cite e-cigarettes as a contributor to youth smoking.Nepalis do not need to produce an ID to purchase either tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Amit, for instance, was still a minor when he started vaping. That these harmful products are freely available to people of all age groups goes against the Tobacco Products (Control and Regulatory) Act, 2068 (2011), which says that it is illegal to sell tobacco products to those below the age of 18.“A stricter control on the sale of tobacco products is essential to curb smoking among youths,” says Dr Bhakta Bahadur KC, chief of Health Promotion and Tobacco Control at NHEICC. KC adds that to prevent minors and pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to the risks of smoking, from purchasing cigarettes, local governments should introduce provisions on licensing. “This is one way to control smoking in vulnerable groups,” says KC.Moreover, banning e-cigarettes fully may not be possible as they are widely sold through social media and smuggled products might still be available for purchase online. The NHEICC is currently calling on other ministries, including the Ministry of Information and Technology, and the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, to help it ban e-cigarettes as they are imported from foreign markets.“Right now, the NHEICC is focused on banning e-cigarettes as a whole due to its adverse effects on the health of young adults, and its role as a gateway to tobacco smoking,” KC says.But Dr Augraj Uprety, Doctor of Medicine at the BPKIHS Department of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine in Dharan, provides a different perspective. With the ban on vapes, youths may find themselves attracted to tobacco smoking, as a significant number of vape users, like Rita, turn to e-cigarettes, supposedly to protect themselves from the harmful impacts of tobacco cigarettes.“Banning e-cigarette is not a cure-all,” Uprety says. “It is also vital to focus on handling the nicotine-dependence syndrome which both tobacco and e-cigarette users experience.”Both tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly addictive chemical, but tobacco cigarettes contain higher amounts of toxic chemicals than e-cigarettes. But studies show that e-cigarettes are especially harmful for youths as they affect adolescent brain development due to exposure to nicotine, and the aerosol in e-cigarettes has known effects on lungs.Further, there is little knowledge about the long-term impacts of e-cigarettes as it’s a relatively new technology.“I will never say banning e-cigarettes is a bad thing. It is an important move,” Uprety says. “But we also need to conduct a pilot study to figure out the repercussions of a potential ban.” \nAs pre-monsoon rains pick up pace, concerns mount about an imminent outbreak of the dengue disease. All that is required for the disease to flare up are stagnant water and hot temperatures, both already present in various parts of the country.“Dengue vectors are already there in many places across the country,” said Professor Murari Das, an entomologist at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “With the right conditions like water and warmth required for vector breeding available now, we can expect a spike in dengue cases in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said that 57 districts, including three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur—have already reported cases of dengue infection.“On average, around 50 people across the country are becoming infected with the dengue virus every week,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “The number could rise in the coming days, as pre-monsoon rainfall activities have recently increased.”Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease throughout the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Around 1,000 people have already been infected with the deadly disease since the start of 2024, according to officials.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of people infected with the deadly virus do not show any symptoms. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus throughout the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Experts say that this is the right time to prepare and prevent possible outbreaks in the coming days.They say that it will be too late if they wait for a massive outbreak. Authorities concerned should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance and take other measures to cut the risk, according to them. Health Ministry officials said that they have alerted all agencies concerned about the risk of a dengue outbreak.“We have alerted all relevant agencies about the risk of a dengue outbreak in the coming days,’ said Dahal. Authorities and agencies at some local units have started activities to make people aware of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, including launching an awareness drive.”Dengue has become endemic in Nepal, as cases of infection are reported throughout the year. Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities are yet to take it seriously. They believe that this lackadaisical approach is responsible for the spread of the virus. What authorities concerned do most of the time is count the number of infections and deaths, according to them.They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population plans to screen pregnant women for mental health problems, which have been emerging as a leading cause of maternal deaths.Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and prompt treatment will help cut down on maternal deaths that have been rising alarmingly of late.“We plan to start screening from Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital,” said Dr Gauri Shrestha, chief of the Safe Motherhood Programme at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “As part of the pilot, all pregnant women seeking service will be screened from the first and postnatal trimesters.”A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with the majority occurring during pregnancy.The report shows that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications.Nepal had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The report showed 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. The study was carried out in 2021.Every year, hundreds of women in the country succumb to preventable deaths from excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), which have been identified as chief causes of maternal deaths in Nepal.However, the 2021 study also shows that a significant number of maternal deaths are also caused by non-obstetric complications such as intentional self-harm.Of the 611 maternal deaths on which the study was based, 67 percent occurred during and after childbirth, according to the report.The census report shows 33 percent of the total maternal deaths occurred during pregnancy, six percent died during childbirth and 61 percent during the postpartum stage.Of the total maternal deaths, nearly a half (47 percent) occurred in Lumbini and Madhesh provinces. The report shows that 10 percent of the victims were 15 to 19 years old. Fifty-seven percent of the deaths happened in health facilities and 26 percent at homes. Of the total maternal deaths, 412 women (53 per cent) went to four antenatal care visits, and of the 173 women who died between seven to 42 days, 45 percent had received postnatal care.As part of its efforts to reduce maternal deaths, the Health Ministry has made it mandatory for women to make eight antenatal care visits and three postnatal care visits.Of the total maternal deaths, six percent (37 women) had undergone abortion or suffered a miscarriage. The report shows that 62 percent of the women took maternity services at state-run health facilities whereas 38 percent gave birth at private health centres.The report shows family members of 83 percent of women who died during or after childbirth tried to get hospital care. Forty-eight percent of those who did use hospital services did not deem it necessary to seek institutional care, according to the report.Delay in finding appropriate health facilities (57 percent), delay in reaching appropriate health facilities (33 percent) and delay in getting appropriate health services (40 percent) are three major causes of maternal deaths, the study shows. Of the total maternal deaths, 17 percent were attributed to all three aforementioned causes and 74 percent to at least one of three causes.The report suggested improving the quality of services and the referral system and making ambulances available for emergency calls as possible ways for identifying the risks on time. The report also suggested carrying out maternal death surveillance regularly to reduce preventable deaths.The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes including free institutional delivery service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. The ministry has also distributed misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. “As the annual health budget does not help us carry out screening of mental health programmes in many places, we are starting the programme as a pilot from the Maternity Hospital,” said Shrestha. “This programme will be expanded in the coming years to other districts, as it is impossible to prevent suicide of pregnant women without treatment of mental health problems.”Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nArmed Police Force Club women’s dominance continued in domestic cricket as they defeated Sudurpaschim Province by two runs in a thrilling final to win their fourth consecutive title at the Lalitpur Mayor Women’s T20 Championship at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Saturday.APF have now won all four editions of the championship. They had entered the tournament as the winners of the Prime Minister Cup Women’s National T20 Cricket Tournament. APF have also terrorised the PM Cup winning six out of nine editions.For Sudurpaschim, they have now fallen short in the title match for a third time against APF after also reaching the final in 2021 and 2022. Koshi had reached the final in 2023.In fact, Sudurpaschim, who were chasing 153, almost ended APF’s stranglehold in the championship on Saturday when Kabita Joshi smashed three sixes in the 19th over to leave her side only needing six runs from the last over for a historic victory.Kabita Joshi played an unbeaten innings of 67 runs and Laxmi Saud made 29 not out to take Sudurpaschim from 49-5 in the seventh over to 150-5 (101-run partnership) before the final over, and inch closer to their first title.But the duo ran out of batteries when needed most as they could only manage three runs from the last over, thanks to a tight bowling from Rekha Rawal.Joshi’s 45-ball knock featured seven boundaries and three sixes.Captain Bindu Rawal contributed 19 off 17, while Sabitri Dhami made 12 off nine balls and Samjhana Khadka played 8-ball 10 for Sudurpaschim.Karuna Bhandari took 2-20 including the wicket of dangerous Khadka who had scored two fifties in this tournament.Earlier, APF opted to bat first and posted a big total of 155-4 with the help of half-centuries from openers Rajmati Airee and Sita Rana Magar.Airee scored 50 runs off 46 balls hitting seven fours. Captain Rana Magar cracked eight fours in her 55-ball 74. The opening duo also added 91 runs for the first wicket.National team skipper added nine, Roma Thapa contributed six and Mamta Chaudhary made 10 not out to guide APF to a huge total.Radhika Pujara, Bindu and Ritu Kanoujiya took one wicket apiece for Sudurpaschim. \nTribhuvan Army Club’s Deepak Adhikari and Nepal Police Club’s Rajpura Pachhai won the men’s and women’s half-marathon titles of the 2024 Kantipur Half Marathon on Saturday.Adhikari, who was a runner-up in the 2022 edition, timed one hour seven minutes and 15 seconds to win the men’s 21.1 km race to claim his maiden Kantipur Half Marathon title.Rajpura Pachhai defended the title of the women’s 21.1 km half marathon.

The college run was added to the event from the 2023 edition.The 21.1 km half marathon—the main event of the annual road running event—started from the Central Business Park, the office of Kantipur Publications at Thapathali, and will traverse through Maitighar Mandala, Baneshwar, Tinkune, Koteshwar, Jadibuti, Lokanthali, Ghatthaghar, Thimi, Sallaghari chowk and returned via the same route before finishing at the starting point.The winners of the men’s and women’s half-marathon will bag a purse of Rs100,000 each. The runner-up will receive Rs50,000, while the third-placed, fourth-placed, fifth-placed and sixth-placed runners will get Rs30,000, Rs20,000, Rs10,000 and Rs5,000, respectively.The winner, runner-up and the third-place finisher in the wheelchair category will earn Rs30,000, Rs20,000 and Rs10,000, respectively.The top-three finishers of corporate run and college run will also receive various prizes and gift hampers.Kantipur Media Group first organised the road-running event on February 19, 2011 to commemorate its 18th anniversary. More than 1,000 runners had participated in the first edition.The event has been continued annually since, establishing itself as one of the premier distance running events in the country. \nIsraeli planes and tanks pounded areas across the Gaza Strip, residents said, as White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday amid US calls for a more focused military campaign.Sullivan was expected to press for Israel to go after Hamas militants in a targeted way, not with a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the White House said before the discussions.Israel has been pushing into the city that it says is the last bastion of Hamas forces. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled the area that was one of their few remaining places of refuge.“Across the Gaza Strip, there is no safety,” said Majid Omran who told Reuters his family had fled Rafah and just returned to what was left of their home in the southern city of Khan Younis that they had fled nearly five months ago.“We took our children, grandchildren, and daughters and we came and lived above the rubble of our home. Because there is no place to take refuge here,” Omran told Reuters inside the wrecked property as a woman cooked over a fire.Israeli forces also pushed deeper into the narrow alleyways of Jabalia in northern Gaza overnight and into Sunday, returning to an area that they said they had cleared earlier in the conflict, residents said.The Israeli military has said its operations in Jabalia - the largest of Gaza’s eight historic refugee camps - are precise and meant to stop Hamas from reestablishing its grip there.The Israeli military said it was “operating to identify armed terrorist cells and... conducting dozens of strikes to assist the forces operating on the ground” in the Jabalia area.TALKS, TUNNELS, THREATSAhead of Sunday’s talks, an Israeli official said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his senior aides would try to reach agreement with Sullivan about the need for press ahead with the Rafah push.Past US misgivings about the feasibility of Israel’s humanitarian measures may have been allayed by the evacuation around half of the city’s Palestinians in 12 days, said the official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.“We’ve shown that this is not only necessary, but doable,” added the official.The official said Israel would also air concerns about dozens of tunnels it says its forces have found under Rafah, running into next-door Egypt - which has condemned the military sweep.“These tunnels are used by Hamas to supply itself with weapons and ammunition, and could potentially be used to smuggle out of Gaza hostages or Hamas senior operatives,” Deputy Israeli State Attorney Noam Gilad said during a hearing at The Hague on Friday, in a rare detailing of allegations that Egypt’s state information service previously dismissed as untrue.Netanyahu has said the operation in Rafah, where Israel believes that as much as a quarter of Hamas’ fighting forces are holed up, could be completed within weeks.Washington worries for the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians sheltering there, and has cited a need not just to evacuate them but also to ensure adequate alternative accommodation.At least 28 Palestinians were killed on Sunday, Gaza health officials and Hamas said, most of them in a strike on a house in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip.The Gaza Civil Emergency Service said in a statement rescue teams have so far recovered the bodies of 150 Palestinians killed by the army in recent days, and that 300 houses had been struck by Israeli aerial and ground fire.The October 7 Hamas assault on Israel that sparked the war killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. About 125 of the 253 people abducted in the raid are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza.At least 35,386 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since October 7, according to the enclave’s health ministry. Aid agencies have warned of widespread hunger and shortages of fuel and medical supplies.The US military said on Friday trucks had started moving aid ashore from a temporary pier built by its forces, the first to reach the besieged enclave by sea in weeks.The Popular Resistance Committee (PRC), an armed group that fights alongside Hamas in Gaza, released a statement saying the pier had been built to ease political pressure on Israel, and that any Israeli or US troops on its territory would be considered a legitimate target.On Saturday, Hamas also raised concerns about the pier, warned against any foreign military force in Gaza, but made no direct threats.In March, when President Joe Biden announced his country’s pier construction plans, he said: “No US boots will be on the ground.” \nA helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister crashed on Sunday as it was crossing mountain terrain in heavy fog, an Iranian official told Reuters, and rescuers were struggling to reach the site of the incident.The official said the lives of Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian were “at risk following the helicopter crash”, which happened on the way back from a visit to the border with Azerbaijan in Iran’s northwest.“We are still hopeful but information coming from the crash site is very concerning,” the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.State TV quoted an official as saying at least one passenger and one crew member had been in contact with rescuers.A Turkish drone identified a source of heat suspected to be the helicopter’s wreckage and had shared the coordinates of the possible crash site with Iranian authorities, Anadolu news agency said on X.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran’s nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.Iranian state media said bad weather caused the crash and was complicating rescue efforts. State news agency IRNA said Raisi was flying in a US-made Bell 212 helicopter.The chief of staff of Iran’s army ordered all resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guards to be put to use in search and rescue operations.Earlier, the national broadcaster had stopped all regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country.In the early hours of Monday, it showed a rescue team, wearing bright jackets and head torches, huddled around a GPS device as they searched a pitch-black mountainside on foot amid a snowy blizzard.“We are thoroughly searching every inch of the general area of the crash,” state media quoted a regional army commander as saying. “The area has very cold, rainy, and foggy weather conditions. The rain is gradually turning into snow.”Neighbouring countries expressed concern and offered assistance in any rescue. The White House said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on reports about the crash. Turkey said it had assigned a drone, a helicopter, vehicles and a rescue team after a request by Iranian authorities. The European Union offered emergency satellite mapping technology.HARDLINER, POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR TO KHAMENEIThe crash comes at a time of growing dissent within Iran over an array of political, social and economic crises. Iran’s clerical rulers face international pressure over Tehran’s disputed nuclear programme and its deepening military ties with Russia during the war in Ukraine.Since Iran’s ally Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, provoking Israel’s assault on Gaza, conflagrations involving Iran-aligned groups have erupted throughout the Middle East.Raisi, 63, was elected president in 2021, and since taking office has ordered a tightening of morality laws, overseen a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests and pushed hard in nuclear talks with world powers.In Iran’s dual political system, split between the clerical establishment and the government, it is Raisi’s 85-year-old mentor Khamenei, supreme leader since 1989, who holds decision-making power on all major policies.For years many have seen Raisi as a strong contender to succeed Khamenei, who has endorsed Raisi's main policies.Raisi’s victory in a closely managed election in 2021 brought all branches of power under the control of hardliners, after eight years when the presidency had been held by pragmatist Hassan Rouhani and a nuclear deal negotiated with powers including Washington.However, Raisi’s standing may have been dented by widespread protests against clerical rule and a failure to turn around Iran's economy, hamstrung by Western sanctions.Raisi had been at the Azerbaijani border on Sunday to inaugurate the Qiz-Qalasi Dam, a joint project. Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev, who said he had bid a “friendly farewell” to Raisi earlier in the day, offered assistance in the rescue. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nFrom historical myths to modern femtech apps, the focus of medical products aimed at women is often profit, not well-being. For centuries, women have been bombarded with a relentless marketing push for unnecessary medical products and services that often have questionable benefits for their health.From Victorian-era manuals promising control over a baby's sex to the booming modern-day female technology or femtech app market, the focus seems to be on creating a market of \"worried well\" women rather than addressing genuine health concerns.Women are known to spend far more on health compared to men, with more of women's health services subject to higher out-of-pocket expense—a healthcare cost gap that exacerbates gender-based pay inequalities. Scare-mongering medical marketing may be contributing to this problem by driving more women to unnecessary tests or treatments.Historically, doctors viewed women as the \"sicker sex,\" leading to a surge in medical advice manuals—many focusing on female reproductive health—as early as the 1820s. These manuals, often rife with misinformation, were a prime example of capitalising on women's anxieties. One of the most commercially successful popular medical books of the 19th century gave medical advice to women about how to influence the sex of their child through specific foods and conceptive practices.Another book in the late 20th century sold even more copies with a focus on this same topic. Even as numerous medical experts and research studies had long debunked the notion that the sex of infants could be influenced, products and services purporting to assist women in this flourished.Today this is still the case but in a different form: IVF clinics in some countries provide for women and couples who wish to have a child of a specific sex, by selecting embryos on this basis. It's a costly process: US fertility clinics charge around $4,500 for sex selection—on top of the cost of IVF, which sets patients back around $12,000-$14,000 per cycle.Menopause is another area heavily targeted by marketers. This natural life stage has long been a major focus of gendered commercial targeting—through advice manuals, hormonal balancing programmes and coaching services, and especially through hormonal and pseudo-hormonal products. In 2024, the market for menopause medical products was valued at around $758.5 million, outstripping other medical products marketed at women worldwide by more than double. In Australia, a major 2023 study found there are strong financial incentives to \"catastrophise\" menopause to drive women to purchase treatments. The authors from the Australasian Menopause Society, the Women's Health Research Program at Monash University and Jean Hailes for Women's Health, welcomed the fact \"that perimenopause and menopause are now being discussed publicly\"—but cautioned medical marketers to avoid \"catastrophising\" menopause, \"particularly in the advertising of goods and services, as it could have the unintended consequences of eroding women's resilience and stigmatising women as they approach midlife.\"While there is no doubt that some women suffer disruptive hot flashes and other symptoms in menopause, many do not at all, and known menopause symptoms are claimed to be found only in Western cultures. The globalisation of menopause marketing is therefore creating new markets of \"worried well\" women who otherwise might not consider they needed medicating. Researchers have referred to this as \"disease-mongering\". In the case of menopause products, it may be deeply problematic given the emerging evidence that hormone products taken by midlife women may influence their later risk of diseases of ageing such as dementia and stroke.The rapidly growing femtech industry is another area where some companies are cashing in on women's health—in a way that may not always benefit women as promised. Femtech is a form of women's health technology that has been rapidly growing since 2018. In 2023, the femtech app market was valued at approximately $30 billion and is projected to reach $135 billion by 2032—that is an expected compound annual growth rate of 16 percent.The rise of femtech apps seems like a step forward, offering support for issues like reproductive health or general wellness, which are often overlooked by traditional medicine. Femtech may provide support for some women's health issues that are currently underserved by medical services, such as endometriosis, women's ADHD, and seronegative chronic diseases that often result in women's \"medical gaslighting\".However, the huge profits generated by the femtech industry's expansion raise questions about whether such projects are primarily aimed at improving women's well-being or rather at maximising the potential of women's health concerns as an extractable market. There is growing concern that many women's health apps have inadequate privacy and security practices. Fertility apps, for example, often collect sensitive data about pregnancies and menstrual cycles—and sometimes then share it with others, exposing it to \"re-identification\" and data breach risks. These apps are not always transparent about the data they trade with and collect from other companies.-360info \nThe aspirations of multiple generations are tied to a nation’s development through experience, expertise, skill, new ideas and innovation. This lays the groundwork for a thriving society where each individual plays a vital role. For such a vision to come to fruition, it is essential to effectively utilise human resources. However, the question persists: How can a nation tap into the potential of its young workforce, ambitious achievers, learners, experienced retirees, migrant returnees and vulnerable populations primed for empowerment through education?Consider the management of police and military personnel on the verge of retirement, mainly those retiring in five years. In the past fiscal year, 5,961 police personnel chose voluntary retirement. One wonders what happens to their preparedness for combat and mindset regarding deployment after retirement and when retirement time approaches. The security mindset ingrained in police forces and militaries demands perpetual vigilance, rigorous training and an unwavering commitment to upholding public safety through proactive assessment and decisive action when required. There is a need to balance the seasoned and disciplined attributes they hone over the years.Comprehending the present challenges faced by students in Nepal is another aspect worth considering, as it can offer valuable perspectives on the employment scenario. Recent findings from the first-ever textbook audit report conducted by Education in Every Home, an organisation working on the education sector in Nepal, paint a stark picture: Only 75 percent children complete 8th grade, with a mere 27 percent advancing to 12th grade. How can the diverse youth receive the support they need from the government and society to enhance their thought processes and effectively utilise their potential when they don’t complete their education? Enhancing human resource management for those on the brink of retirement and promoting youth employment demands more than abstract notions. Practical steps are required to unite people of all ages. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and mentorship programmes is paramount. Moreover, it’s imperative to foster connections among eager learners, individuals seeking guidance and those who derive fulfilment from careers like police and military service. By valuing these professions and harnessing the spirit of youth, we can create a more dynamic and impactful community. Yet, beyond these efforts, we must explore innovative strategies to effectively manage human resources and combat unemployment. Tackling unemploymentThe unemployment problem can be tackled in two ways. First, the government can emulate the historical approach of Franklin D Roosevelt, who galvanised the “lost generation” to pioneer civilian conservation corps initiatives in forestry, flood control and infrastructure enhancements in the United States. As Homraj Acharya, a seasoned policy expert with extensive experience in US government and development projects in South Asia, contends, the Roosevelt approach left an indelible mark on the physical, psychological and employability facets of three million individuals enrolled in the programme. Their involvement in economic relief and conservation efforts offers a blueprint for modern initiatives tackling poverty and environmental concerns. Enrollees resided in camps, engaged in various projects and underwent rigorous training and education within the corps. This precedent offers a compelling model for addressing unemployment, poverty and environmental conservation.Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt’s visionary approach, Nepal could mobilise individuals nearing retirement age to establish a development brigade. This could enlist 50,000 individuals with approximately five years left until retirement, comprising 5,000 from the police force, 5,000 from the military and 40,000 from civilian sectors. The government can allocate additional funds to boost the salaries of police and military officers nearing retirement for joining the development brigade. These individuals can undertake infrastructure development, community enhancement, park innovation, river and lake clean up and conservation, road construction, solar panel installations, reforestation, herbs production and processing and unused productive land utilisation. This strategic initiative addresses unemployment and capitalises on valuable skills and expertise for national advancement. By offering meaningful employment opportunities in these sectors, Nepal can harness their skills and experience, reducing unemployment rates. This targeted approach would ensure continued workforce contribution and alleviate the financial burden on social welfare programmes, ultimately promoting more excellent economic stability and societal resilience.Second, to actively engage youth and students in meaningful work, introducing service learning—an educational approach—can inspire them to participate in community-based projects, nurturing awareness, empathy, critical thinking skills, leadership abilities, teamwork, cultural competence, communication skill and a sense of social responsibility. The mandatory service-learning project for high school students can be easily connected to the development brigade initiative, suggests Acharya. The programme, also known as community learning or experiential learning, can foster collaboration between universities, businesses, nonprofits and government entities, benefiting the local community. Through service-learning courses, students earn credits while undertaking hands-on experiences such as office work, fieldwork, journaling and reflection papers. They can expand professional networks, cultivate friendships, enhance well-being, build confidence, confirm career interests, and explore new fields of study. Introducing the concept of service learning, which can later evolve into the digital literacy brigade, can facilitate a smooth transition from acquiring practical skills to addressing unemployment for the youth and students of Nepal. As students engage in hands-on experiences during service-learning courses, they cultivate crucial skills for navigating the generational realm, enhancing employability and contributing to workforce readiness. This will ultimately benefit the country through a more skilled and capable workforce fostering economic improvement. Such initiatives provide practical solutions and promote a unified responsibility for societal progress. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and meaningful employment opportunities shall ensure that everyone, regardless of age or background, can meaningfully contribute to the nation’s advancement. By grasping the importance of intelligent human resource management and investing in the growth of citizens, Nepal can build a rock-solid base for a vibrant and challenging society.

While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nPeople lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. \nThe third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit starts today. At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepal’s political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investors—from India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Group—were interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Let’s invest in Nepal. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nOur attention has been drawn to a news report published by The Kathmandu Post regarding our operations in Helambu (‘Helambu administration says Melamchi project didn’t pay promised tax’, March 31).Quoting the rural municipality, the paper writes, ‘Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, the Chinese contractor company of the project, has not paid for the resources—slates, stones, soils and other riverbed materials—used while constructing Ambathan dam and other infrastructures in Helambu Rural Municipality Ward No 1.’ Our main objection goes with this sentence of the news. Sinohydro began completing the uncompleted infrastructures of the Melamchi Water Supply Project after making a formal agreement with the concerned agencies of the Government of Nepal. We have signed the terms and conditions and we assure you that we abide by the clauses mentioned in the agreement. As a construction company, we managed construction materials from different legal sources. Some materials were imported from foreign countries while some of them were purchased locally and also some of them is recycling of discarded bulk rock and soil from the tunnel or dam excavation period. As mentioned in the news, the company used slates, stones, soil and other riverbed materials in the infrastructure, but all these materials were used under construction for three major purposes. The first one is aggregate used for mixing concrete and backfill work which were legally bought from local vendors and suppliers with fully paid taxes. The second one is backfill stone used for gabion wall work. The last one is the hard stone used for laying weir lining. The latter two were recycled excavated mucking rock heaped up in the construction field rather than the river bed materials. For the aggregate, the company has paid all the vendors and suppliers for the materials they supplied and we believe that all of the vendors and suppliers are satisfied with the company. The entire bill, invoices, payment receipts, dispatches and all other documents of transactions and payments concerning the local and the foreign vendors and suppliers are transparent, and are kept safely in the company’s office. The news report is misleading, and should be amended.Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, via email \nWe understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019. Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal \nI am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25). I would like to add that much of what we achieved at SOAS University of London would not have been possible without the contribution of my colleague Krishna Pradhan. Pradhan taught Nepali at SOAS for 15 years until his own early retirement in 2019, and was greatly admired by the many students who learned so much from him. His presence at SOAS also enabled me to develop courses in Nepali literature, history and culture alongside the essential language courses. Sadly, none of this will be available to future generations of students in the UK.Michael Hutt,Emeritus Professor of Nepali and Himalayan Studies,SOAS, University of London \nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.

In the story cover all the events as much as possible, try to weave them together, making a beautiful story.\n    Be elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings. Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe ruling and opposition parties seem to be drifting further apart over the issue of investigating the cooperatives scam as leaders from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Nepali Congress compete in making personal accusations against each other.A meeting of the top leaders of the major ruling and opposition parties on Saturday evening had in principle agreed to constitute a parliamentary panel to investigate the scam. As per their agreement, a four-member committee led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, who also is a CPN-UML leader, was formed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the parliamentary probe. The committee also includes Jeevan Pariyar from the Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the UML, and Shishir Khanal of the RSP. However, marathon meetings by the Giri-led panel starting Sunday morning could not agree on the ToR as the ruling parties stuck to their guns. The main opposition insisted that the investigation against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the primary focus of the probe panel. The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the RSP chair.“We don’t want the committee just for the sake of forming one. It needs to investigate what we are pressing for,” said Ramesh Lekhak, Nepali Congress chief whip. “The ruling parties want a probe panel with a broader objective, without investigating the home minister.” The ruling party leaders, however, say the Congress wants to form the committee with the objective of implicating a particular person (Lamichhane). “The sole objective of the Congress is to target an individual, which is not acceptable. Their demand has nothing to do with resolving the problems in the cooperative sector but only with implicating the home minister,” said the UML’s Bartaula.RSP leaders say they were even flexible about including (Lamichhane-linked) Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation, but only if the Congress agrees to allow the probe committee to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden. “However, the Congress leaders didn’t agree. They backtracked from Saturday's agreement,” said the RSP’s Khanal. As the parties were in negotiations to finalise the ToR, a meeting of the House of Representatives called for 11 in the morning was postponed to 2 pm, which was again postponed to 4 pm. With no agreement in sight, the House meeting finally commenced at 6 in the evening with the single agenda of allowing Lamichhane to clarify the accusations against him.A meeting of the opposition parties held earlier in the morning had agreed to allow the home minister to answer questions raised against him, a chance he had long been asking for. The meeting called by the Congress was attended by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The opposition parties, particularly the Congress, which had been barring Lamichhane from addressing the House and presenting bills, had agreed to allow him to clarify the matter. Addressing the House after more than two months, Lamichhane not only defended himself, but also launched a personal attacks on several Congress leaders. Daring anyone to present concrete evidence of fraud, he said, “I challenge anyone to show evidence that any decision was made to acquire a loan from cooperatives, that I submitted any loan applications or signatures during the loan process, or that any funds were deposited into my account during my tenure at Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd.” He claimed that fake loan statements were prepared in the cooperatives in his name, for which he is not responsible. “I haven’t signed any documents nor have I been on their boards or served in official capacity in any of the cooperatives. Never ever did the Gorkha Media decide to take loans from cooperatives,” he said. “I am not responsible to clear the filth created by [then Gorkha Media chair] GB Rai.” He said he has been hounded based on the sensational media headlines targeting him. Lamichhane also lashed out at the Nepali Congress, revealing that the party had offered him the prime ministerial position for a term of a year and a half. He questioned the party's moral stance, wondering why they considered him unfit for the role of home minister yet found him suitable for prime minister.“If I am ineligible to serve as home minister, with what moral justification do I assume the post of prime minister? I wish to raise this question in the House today. Is the offer for the prime ministerial position still valid, or has it lapsed?” said Lamichhane.He asked if the Congress was ready to constitute a probe panel against everyone the media has linked with corruption. Without naming Gagan Thapa, the Congress general secretary, Lamichhane accused him of selling the country's secret information to foreigners. Citing media reports, he also claimed that Thapa had embezzled millions of rupees in the name of constructing a park at Tri-Chandra College and had misused agricultural grants. He also asked whether the main opposition would want a probe panel against those who have been accused of grabbing the land of Bansbari Leather and Shoe Factory, illegally registering public land in Tikapur under individuals’ name, and stealing luxury watches, or selling diplomatic passports. “Not just those who hold two or three citizenship, the agents and assets of the foreigners who hold one citizenship and one passport but sell the country’s secret information must be ousted as the lawmaker,” he said.In response, the Congress leaders said Lamichhane was rattled by the demands to investigate him. Holding a press meet after the House meeting, Congress leader Thapa said not just Lamichhane but his larger team is also involved in the embezzlement of savings from cooperatives. “It seems they [Lamichhane and other RSP leaders] are trying their luck at running a political party having already operated cooperatives and a media company,” he said. Stating that such committees have been constituted in the past, Thapa said if Ram Sharan Mahat, Bharat Mohan Adhikari or Janardan Sharma can be investigated, why not Lamichhane. He also challenged the home minister to uncover any wrongdoing on his part. “If I am guilty, I need to face legal action. If he is guilty he has to go through the same process,” he said asking Lamichhane why he fears investigations.Thapa challenged the home minister to investigate his entire life, starting from his birth in Prasuti Griha [maternity hospital] in Kathmandu. “Look at the kinds of allegations he [Lamichhane] has levelled against me. I request him: Please form a committee to probe me… Such a committee to probe Gagan Thapa can be formed even within the RSP. Please do it.”Thapa said his party primarily wants an investigation into the embezzlement of money in the cooperatives with Lamichhane’s involvement as they believe that police have been barred from investigating them.“We are clear the House cannot function until a probe committee is formed as per our demand. The vote of trust motion will also not move ahead so long as the committee is not formed,\" said Thapa.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take a vote of trust from the lower house on Monday. However, lack of agreement among the parties has put it into uncertainty. “We will try to agree on the ToR on Monday morning. Even if we can’t come to an agreement, the Congress should allow the vote on the trust motion as it is being done as per a constitutional obligation,” said Bartaula. \nJanata Samajbadi Party (JSP) Nepal President Upendra Yadav filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court on Sunday demanding that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s vote of confidence motion be stopped.The main opposition Nepali Congress permitting, Dahal is set to seek a floor test on Monday for the fourth time since becoming prime minister on December 25, 2022. Govinda Prasad Ghimire, the Supreme Court’s information officer, said JSP-Nepal chair Yadav filed a petition against the trust motion in Parliament. “In his petition, Yadav claims that holding a vote of confidence in Parliament will not be valid at a time when the dispute between his party and the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party has not been resolved,” Ghimire told the Post.Yadav, in his petition, also claimed that the seven lawmakers who defected to the Rai-led JSP are ineligible to vote in Parliament, arguing that they are partyless. The court has scheduled a hearing on the petition for Monday.Yadav also submitted an application to Speaker Devraj Ghimire on Sunday urging him not to include the seven lawmakers in the process to conduct the vote of confidence.Earlier, the JSP-Nepal moved the Supreme Court against the Election Commission’s decision to register the splinter group. Hearing the petition, the top court on May 15 ordered that the new party registration process be put on hold. A hearing on whether to issue an interim order will be decided in the hearing scheduled for Tuesday.The Election Commission registered the Ashok Rai-led group as Janata Samajbadi Party on May 6. On May 5, Rai, along with six other lawmakers and 30 central committee members of the party, quit the JSP-Nepal to form the new party.Officials at the election body said that the Rai-led party was recognised in accordance with the Political Parties Act 2017 and registered according to Section 33 of the Act and Rule 5 of the Regulations on Political Parties 2017. However, an ordinance had nullified the Act three years ago. “The party was recognised based on the regulations related to the Political Parties Act, a regulation that has already been withdrawn. Thus the party lawmakers cannot give the vote of confidence in Parliament,” Tejman Shrestha, assistant professor of Nepal Law Campus, told the Post. “As the Supreme Court has also ordered to maintain the status quo in the party, lawmakers of the new party will be obliged to follow the whip of the mother party should they vote in Parliament.”However, former attorney general Mukti Pradhan said the court’s order to maintain the status quo in the party’s division does not necessarily mean the lawmakers should follow the whip issued by the Yadav-led party.“The court has not questioned the legitimacy of the lawmakers,” Pradhan told the Post. “Lawmakers of the splinter faction have a right to vote for the prime minister if they want.”JSP-Nepal, led by Yadav, withdrew its support to the Dahal government on May 13, accusing the major coalition partner of engineering the party’s split. Before pulling the plug on the government, party chief Yadav was the deputy prime minister and minister for health and population. Prime Minister Dahal decided to seek a vote of confidence in the House after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support. Without the splinter faction, the JSP-Nepal commands five lawmakers in the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Dahal, chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), on March 4 broke the year-long alliance with the Nepali Congress and joined hands with the CPN-UML. He also brought the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal), and the CPN (Unified Socialist) Party on board. Dahal earlier tested the floor on March 13, and got 157 votes in his favour.However, legal experts have differing interpretations of the prime minister’s decision to seek a trust vote. “When a prime minister commands the majority in Parliament even after a coalition partner withdraws support, it is not necessary to seek a vote of confidence,” former attorney general Raman Shrestha, who is close to the Maoist Centre, told the Post. But assistant professor Tejman Shrestha disagrees. “The constitution has a clear provision that the prime minister must seek a vote of confidence when a coalition partner withdraws its support,” he told the Post. Article 100 (2) of the constitution states that “if the political party which the prime minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition government withdraws its support, the prime minister shall table a motion in the House of Representatives for a vote of confidence within 30 days.”The Supreme Court's verdict regarding the split in the JSP-Nepal may turn out to be in favour of the government or against it. Therefore, the prime minister is seeking a vote of confidence before the verdict, says Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science. “If the prime minister wins the vote of trust on Monday, he will get another 30 days for political manoeuvring even if he needs to win a vote of confidence yet again,” Pokharel told the Post. But political analyst Jhalak Subedi doesn’t buy the argument. “If the prime minister loses support in Parliament, he will still have 30 days to show his majority,” Subedi told the Post. “So the ruling coalition’s possible concern is not only a Supreme Court verdict on the JSP-Nepal split.”Subedi said the ruling coalition may be looking to present the budget through an ordinance as the main opposition has been obstructing the parliamentary proceedings.“A prime minister who has just secured the vote of trust from Parliament will have more political capital to bring the budget through an ordinance,” Subedi added. “This might also be the reason for his haste.”Manish Kumar Suman, the JSP-Nepal spokesperson, said his party will vote against the prime minister. “Our party will not vote for a leader who engineered our party’s split,” he told the Post.Pradeep Yadav, a leader of the splinter faction and newly appointed minister for health and population in the Dahal Cabinet, said that the seven lawmakers of the new outfit will vote for the prime minister on Monday.“Upendra Yadav has challenged our legitimacy as lawmakers. We will also challenge him in court on Monday morning, but his challenge will not prevent us from voting for the prime minister.”Political analyst Pokharel also interpreted the prime minister’s decision to go for the floor test again as a strategic move.“It would be difficult for the Congress, the party that claims to be the champion of parliamentary practice in Nepal, to obstruct Parliament when the prime minister wants a floor test,” Pokharel said.The Congress on May 14 had lifted its obstruction of Parliament for a day to allow President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes.  \nBindra Devi Pariyar, a 45-year-old woman from ward 1 of Birendranagar Municipality in Surkhet, still remembers the pain and suffering she received seven years ago while working abroad.Pariyar’s life took a drastic turn after a flood in the Dhodekhali stream swept away her house in the monsoon of 2014.Pariyar said that her whole life turned upside down after the flood, resulting in her family being buried in debt.“After the flood, my husband, two daughters, a son, and my mother-in-law started living in a rented apartment with no money or valuables. Due to the disaster, we were unable to pay our home loan. Also, my husband and mother-in-law were struggling with illnesses. So I decided to go abroad,” said Pariyar.Under the false promises of an agent, she was convinced of lucrative prospects in Kuwait, although it is banned for Nepali women workers for employment. She had a loan of Rs1.5 million including the money she borrowed from loan sharks to go abroad.In June 2016, Pariyar was taken to Jhapa and from there to New Delhi (India), Bahrain, Dubai (UAE), and then to Kuwait illegally. Due to continued travel, jet lag, and other health issues, she was unable to eat or sleep for days upon reaching Kuwait, but she continued working there.“In Kuwait, I was tortured physically and mentally to the point that I even contemplated killing myself, but the thought of my family back home kept me going. I worked there for some two months, but they did not pay me,” said Pariyar.After some time, she fell seriously ill and was unable to work. Her employers kicked her out without paying and handed her back to the agent.When she was unable to work, the employers used to even pour hot, boiling water on her and lock her in a cage.The agent demanded some Rs400,000 to let her return home to Nepal.“I managed to get in touch with some other women who had gone to Kuwait illegally, and along with them, we contacted the Nepali embassy, and we were rescued. After completing the legal procedures, I and two other women spent ten days in Kuwaiti prison before returning to Nepal,” Pariyar added.Pariyar, who went abroad in June 2016, only came back to Nepal in March 2017 and is still struggling to repay the loans. Her husband died, and her mother-in-law is paralysed. Now her 19-year-old son is supporting the family by quitting his studies.Pariyar further added that nobody, especially women, should go abroad illegally. If anything goes wrong, they will find themselves helpless in a foreign land with nobody to help.Basanti Pant Karki, a 45-year-old woman from ward 9 of Birendranagar Municipality, legally went to Saudi Arabia in April 2016 and worked there for five years. Karki still vividly recalls the trauma and suffering she suffered in Saudi Arabia.“I used to work as a cleaner in a hospital there, and the job was also good, but the agent who took me there was an evil man; he would force me to work extra hours without any pay and frequently threatened me,” said Karki.After a year, Karki’s husband died in Nepal. When she got the news, she wanted to come back, but the agent did not allow her to leave. Later, she contacted the Nepal embassy in Saudi Arabia and requested assistance to return, but that also did not work.Karki could return home only after a year of her husband’s death.“The agent did not pay my dues but only handed me two tickets—one to go to Nepal and another to return to Saudi Arabia. He threatened me that I would not receive my payment unless I returned to Saudi Arabia. So I returned, after spending two months in Birendranagar,” said Karki. “Even those women who go to Gulf countries legally face physical and mental abuse. I advise all women planning to go to Gulf countries to find a job in Nepal itself, because those countries are not safe for foreign women,” Karki added. According to the Labour and Employment Office, Karnali Province, 4,587 women in the province have received work permits for foreign employment in the last three years.The office has no data on the number of women from the province who went to India and third countries for employment. \nAt Shanti Vatika, Ratnapark, underneath a tent barely keeping out the midday summer sun, people with disabilities are seen huddled together. It’s been 20 days since the protesters asked for a few simple things—mainly that personal assistant services be provided to those who need them.Personal assistant services involve help for people with disabilities in their day-to-day activities. From helping them to shower and dress-up, to driving them around—these services play a vital role in improving the quality of life of people with disabilities.In the ongoing protests at Ratnapark, people with all kinds of disability—wheelchair users, deafblind people, visually and hearing impaired individuals—have made their appearance. And things are looking bleak, especially after the police used excessive force on those coming out on the streets to demonstrate. Bhojraj Shrestha, a wheelchair user, has been part of the protest since day one. Everyday he wonders when he’ll get adequate help to perform simple day-to-day activities. Once he wakes up, he needs to get in his wheelchair, shower, and go out of the house to work. To do all that, he needs help and care. But that help has not been coming, at least not from the government.“Our rights are already enshrined in the law, but what’s the point when there is no implementation?” says Shrestha. The protesters’ demands include provision of personal assistant services in the upcoming fiscal budget to meet the needs and requirements of persons with disabilities. According to Chapter 3, section 9(2) of the Act relating to the rights of Persons with Disabilities, “The persons with disabilities shall have the right to obtain assistive materials and community assistance in order to earn the living respectfully.”The protesters want this right honoured. Lhakpa Nuru Sherpa is the father to a 15-year-old deafblind boy. The family looks after their son, but it isn’t always easy. The son has the right to education as any other child, but when getting him ready for school is so difficult, how is he supposed to enjoy that basic right?“If the government gives us a helper, my son can go to school more easily and enjoy his other rights. A personal caregiver and assistance is all we ask for, which would make a world of difference,” says Sherpa.To make matters worse, on May 15, the police used excessive force on the protesters as they marched from Ratnapark to Maitighar.Bhojraj Shrestha, the wheelchair user, was present that day amid the heckling police officers. The fact that the police had to use force against protesters who were only asking for the fulfilment of their rights enshrined in the constitution confounds him.Sherpa was among the protesters hounded by the police on May 15. Gashes line his arms and hands.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) condemned the excess use of force while trying to crowd control and manage traffic. Among the protesters, 20 were arrested, and seven hospitalised. Ramesh Khadka, a hearing and speech impaired person, needed a CT scan after his neck was bruised, a police constable kicked a woman with disability in her stomach, while the police heckled a 15-year-old deafblind boy on the assumption that he was faking his disability.SSP Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for the Nepal Police, said crowd control and management is part of police duty but the goal is to lead the protesters through certain routes to prevent trouble for passerby and vehicles.“The problems that occurred were the result of trying to control the crowd during the protest. The police don't use such violence especially against people with disabilities,” Karki said.However, protesters, as well as the NHRC, spoke of unwanted police violence.Bikash Thapa, an organiser of the Disability Rights Implementation Street Movement Struggle Committee, says all the protesters are looking for is for their rights enshrined in the constitution to be honoured.“Why are the police preventing us from exercising our right to protest?” says Thapa.Despite what happened that day, the protesters are prepared to continue their fight for justice.The Ministry of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens says the protesters’ demands have already been processed and sent to the Ministry of Finance. The proposal requires the finance ministry’s nod as personal assistance providers for people with disabilities have to be paid.Sherpa believes that with adequate opportunities, and means to exercise them, people with disabilities can excel in life. “The government needs to stop viewing people with disabilities as a burden,” Sherpa says. “After all, we will use the care provided by the government to improve our personal lives and to contribute to the country as a whole.” On May 20, the protesters are preparing for a huge rally with expected participation of people with disabilities from all over Nepal. \nAs India reports an outbreak of West Nile virus, Nepal’s Ministry of Health and Population said it has been assessing the risk of the deadly disease in the country.Nepal is facing a high risk of several vector-borne diseases, including the outbreak of West Nile fever, due to rising temperatures, looming monsoon, the presence of virus-spreading vectors in the country, and free movement of people between the two countries, officials said.“We are aware of the outbreak of West Nile fever in India,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “International Health Regulations also require us to increase our vigilance against the disease.”West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted to humans and animals through the bite of an infected Culex mosquito. The same vector also spreads elephantiasis or filariasis and Japanese encephalitis.Experts say mosquitoes become infected after feeding on infected birds, especially crows. When the infected mosquitoes bite humans and animals, they spread the virus, which can cause neurological problems and death in infected persons. India has reported a death from the West Nile virus in Kerala and six other cases of infections in Thrissur, Malappuram and Kozhikode districts in recent days. Ojha said that Nepal is a member state of the World Health Organisation and receives every alert issued under the International Health Regulations. “Nepal is in the high-risk zone for an outbreak of the West Nile Virus due to its climate, presence of virus spreading vector, and mobility of people to and from the high-risk zones,” said Ojha. At least two cases of West Nile Virus infection were reported in a study carried out in Nepal in 2009-2010. Of 2,046 serum samples tested to examine the virus, two samples contained fragments of the genome resembling virus lineage 1.Experts say there is no specific treatment for West Nile virus. They suggest drinking plenty of water and fluids, resting, and taking medicine for fever in mild cases. “Those experiencing severe headache, high fever, weakness and confusion should see the doctor at the earliest,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “As mosquito breeding season has started, one should also take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.”Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis, as multiple studies have pointed out. The United Nations’s report “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases affected by climate drivers have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also reveals that the warming climate has caused the Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes mosquitos to move to altitudes above 2,000 metres in Nepal. This shift in their distribution has serious implications, as over 100 species of Anopheles transmit malaria, more than 950 species of Aedes spread diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile virus, and over 1,000 species of Culex transmit Japanese encephalitis, filariasis, and West Nile virus.Vector-borne diseases, or VBDs, are spread by carriers like mosquitoes, sandflies, kissing bugs, and ticks. The report says that viruses like dengue, chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal's hilly and mountainous areas.Experts say frequent movement of people is also a reason diseases are detected in new areas. When disease vectors bite an infected person, they transmit the disease, and the vectors’ entire generation gets infected.The Ministry of Health has reported over 1,000 cases of dengue infection since January, this year. \nNepali Congress Vice President and lawmaker Dhanraj Gurung wrote to Speaker Devraj Ghimire on Monday, demanding action against Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane for contempt of parliament.Gurung accused Lamichhane of attempting to defame Congress lawmakers by making false and baseless allegations and failing to adhere to the House rules.“The home minister attempted to defame Congress lawmakers by making false and baseless statements in the House of Representatives meeting on Sunday. He exaggerated issues to mislead the general public and attacked the court’s verdict,” Gurung said in the letter.“He distorted the issue of red passports, which had already been settled by the court, to create confusion among the public.”Gurung said the Minister’s ‘unethical and baseless remarks’ are tantamount to contempt of parliament. Challenging Lamichhane to substantiate his statements, Gurung demanded that action be taken against him if he failed to provide evidence.“I demand the home minister be held accountable for contempt of parliament as he failed to adhere to the conduct of a member of the House in accordance with Rule 219 of the Rules of the House of Representatives,” said Gurung.During his speech on Sunday, Home Minister Lamichhane said the media have reported on ‘misdeeds’ by Nepali Congress leaders and questioned whether parliamentary investigation committees can be formed in each of the cases made public by the media.  \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2018 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition. \nBright blue bookshelves, a sunny courtyard, and a friendly librarian—Junkiri: The Feminist Library is a vibrant and welcoming communal space located in Dhokatole, Kathmandu. Currently, it houses more than 2,500 books and has over 700 members.This library is an initiative of VOW (Voices of Women) Media that aims to increase feminist education by providing easy access to feminist literature, tools and resources to women and girls.The library initially opened on March 8, 2020, but unfortunately, due to lockdown, it had to close down just two weeks later, on March 23. However, in August 2022, the library resumed its operations, welcoming readers back once again.Libraries have never been a neutral space. They have always, in some ways, reflected the various biases, values and power structures of their communities. Not only is there a bias in the selection of library material, but there is also a bias in cataloguing and categorisation. Most notably, the Decimal Dewy System is known to have significant biases against marginalised communities. For example, pregnancy, quite outrageously, is categorised in the disease section through this system. Historically, male authors have dominated intellectual life, which is why it is so crucial to amplify the voices of women through literature and libraries that promote works written by women. Education is a site for social change and transformation, and access to feminist education is crucial in increasing feminist consciousness. In Nepal, the urgency for a feminist library is greater than ever. While progress has been made in areas such as legal reforms and women’s representation in politics, it is still difficult for many people to understand basic concepts like consent and recognition when a minor has been groomed. The victim-blaming culture has also significantly hindered progress.A feminist library serves as a beacon of change against society’s regressions that disproportionately look down on women. Junkiri, as well as VOW media, have played pivotal roles in promoting feminist pedagogy. As a free library, they promote a collaborative and participatory learning environment that values personal narratives. As a community, Junkiri not only educates young girls on topics like consent and raises awareness on feminist issues but also serves as a supportive and guiding community for its members.The library’s collection is divided into three sections: children, young adults, and adults. The children’s section features bright, colourful, and engaging graphic books that educate children about essential topics such as consent, diversity, and empathy. The young adult and adult sections also feature a diverse range of literature, including novels, research books and a selection of queer literature. At first, the library relied on door-to-door marketing around its community to secure members, but it has since expanded through word of mouth. Jenisha Niroula, a library member, says, “I love going to Junkiri because of its jolly environment, especially when they organise children’s reading circles, encouraging young minds to read. I also find many books from female writers that I cannot find elsewhere.” The library organises a reading circle featuring various children's books with around 15-20 children in the community. This fosters a reading culture and helps children bond over books.Junkiri recently organised a Feminist Writing Workshop, encouraging participants to adopt a feminist perspective in their reading analysis and writing. Sam, a library member and a workshop participant, says, “I loved the workshop experience. It was helpful to learn about the ways of critiquing articles and practising writing as a feminist. I also love spending time in the library because of its welcoming librarian and reading space at such a low price.”“A communal space where children of different class groups inter-mingle is becoming increasingly important to foster empathy and bring down the divide between the rich and poor,” says Pooja Panta, the founder of VOW Media. The lack of community spaces in Kathmandu has brought about numerous challenges, and Junkiri plays a crucial role in filling this void by not only offering a communal space but also by supporting feminist literature and amplifying the voices of female and queer authors.Junkiri also serves as an archive. Editions of decade-old Asmita Magazine stored in a box can transport readers into various times in Nepali history when feminists tirelessly advocated for rights and articulated their challenges. “It is sometimes sad to think how very little has changed, and the challenges that women face have remained the same,” says Shashikala Khadka, the librarian.Books and magazines from various time periods serve as valuable resources for young feminists. They offer insights into the nuanced challenges faced by feminists throughout history. By studying these materials, they can better understand their role in disseminating feminist knowledge in the present day.“The best thing about Junkiri is that I don’t have to explain my beliefs as it is a safe space that promotes sisterhood and supports women,” says the librarian. She also recounts instances of individuals on Twitter who resist the feminist movement in general. “Being a feminist has become increasingly villainised, with its meaning being twisted, leading many people to hesitate in identifying with the term,” she adds.Shashikala also helps curate the library. Initially, the books were sourced from donations, but the library has recently begun purchasing to add to its collection. She also stresses the need for more Nepali graphic novels for children and Nepali novels for young adults.“Change is a relay race, it does not happen overnight, but you have to lay the groundwork for the future generation to carry it forward,” Shashikala emphasises.Junkiri is changing existing structures to improve access to feminist resources and information. It stands as the go-to destination for readers seeking thought-provoking literary works while also fostering a community centred on sisterhood and empathy.Junkiri is open Tuesday through Friday (1:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.) and Saturday (10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.). The membership fee is Rs100. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Monday secured the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives.Dahal received 157 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives. One member abstained while none voted against the motion.Members of the main opposition Nepali Congress, which is the largest party in the lower house, did not participate in the voting as they were staging protests in the House. Soon after Speaker Devraj Ghimire announced commencement of the House proceedings, Congress lawmakers gathered around the well and chanted slogans demanding a probe against Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane for his alleged involvement in cooperative scam. A total of 158 lawmakers took part in the voting. The prime minister required at least 138 votes to prove majority in favour of the trust motion. The prime minister had sought the vote of confidence as per Article 100 (2) of the constitution after the Janata Samajbadi Party, Nepal withdrew its support to the government following a split on May 5.This is the fourth time Dahal secured a vote of trust in the parliament after he became prime minister in December 2022 with the support of the CPN-UML, among other parties.Dahal had gone for the floor test for the first time on January 10, 2023. He had received 268 votes then.The prime minister won the trust motion for the second time only three months later as he broke ties with the CPN-UML and forged an alliance with the Nepali Congress. He secured the support of 172 lawmakers at the time.He had to seek the vote of confidence for a third time after Congress withdrew its support to the government after Dahal again broke the alliance with Congress and joined hands with the CPN-UML and other parties on March 4.He had received 157 votes then.The next meeting of the House of Representatives has been scheduled for 11 am on Tuesday. \nDespite federalism's establishment, provinces in Nepal face challenges in governance, as evidenced by the lack of their own police forces, civil servants, and responsive national government, leading to the degradation of natural resources like the Chure region, highlighting the persistence of corrupt practices hindering trickle-down development.\nExtreme weather events, including unprecedented droughts and floods, are severely impacting Nepal's agriculture, hydropower, and water resources, threatening economic growth and poverty reduction goals.\nYoung lawyers face challenges including barriers to entry into the Bar and a lack of mentorship; the Nepal Bar Association must prioritize their needs and foster their development during its upcoming conference.\nDespite minimal government prioritization, media literacy is gradually being fostered in Nepal through efforts by NGOs, journalists, and school curricula, seeking to empower citizens with critical media analysis skills for informed decision-making and active societal engagement.\nICC prosecutor requests arrest warrants for Israeli PM Netanyahu, defense minister, and three Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes in Gaza conflict.\nNepali Congress calls for a joint party meeting to discuss latest political events, including ongoing parliamentary obstruction over the cooperative fraud case and allegations against the Speaker.\nMUMBAI/BHUBANESWAR, May 20 (Reuters) - Indians voted on Monday in the fifth phase of mammoth general elections, with film actors and sports celebrities among the thousands who turned out early in a bid to avoid scorching afternoon heat in the financial hub of Mumbai.Three hours before voting closed, about 48% of voters had cast ballots in Monday’s phase of the world’s largest election, which began on April 19, as weather officials warned of more days of heatwaves than usual through the torrid summer.Votes will be counted on June 4, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to win a rare third consecutive term.Voters at a polling station in a tiny lane in central Mumbai waited for hours in snaking queues that advanced slowly.“It is claustrophobic and people are falling sick,” said housewife Shalini Pawar, 42, who queued for three hours. One woman nearly fainted in the heat, she added, calling for authorities to provide drinking water to those waiting.Nearly a billion people are eligible to vote in India’s election, but after poor initial turnout in early phases, more exercised the franchise to take the average of the first four rounds to 66.95%, with 69% voting in the fourth phase on May 13.Monday’s phase has the fewest constituencies going to the polls, with 89.5 million voters in 49 seats.High-profile candidates in the fray included trade minister Piyush Goyal, standing from one of six seats in Mumbai, and defence minister Rajnath Singh from Lucknow, both cities where there has been poor voter turnout in the past.On Sunday, the Election Commission specifically urged residents of both cities “to erase the stigma” of urban apathy.Mumbai is also home to the Hindi film industry, popularly called Bollywood, where the voters included film stars such as Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Ranveer Singh.Still, with three hours left to the end of voting, just 36% to 39% of eligible voters had turned out across the city’s six constituencies.Gandhi family bastionsTwo boroughs of the opposition Congress party’s Nehru-Gandhi dynasty are also going to the polls in the large politically crucial northern state of Uttar Pradesh.Family scion Rahul Gandhi is contesting the seat of Raebareli, in addition to Wayanad in the south, which has already voted.Smriti Irani, Modi’s minister for women and child development, is contesting from Amethi, where she defeated Gandhi in 2019.Former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir state Omar Abdullah is contesting from Baramulla, one of three seats in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley that neighbouring Pakistan has claimed for decades and was roiled by an insurgency.Voters wanted change, said Gulzar Ahmad Naikoo, 25.“There are cases registered against them and their lives mostly revolve around police-stations,” he added. “They are in trauma and want the cases withdrawn so that they can live a normal life.”Poor voter turnout became a concern for the ruling BJP initially, and analysts believe the low numbers cast doubts on the landslide victory sought by the party and its allies.But queues lengthened outside polling booths in Mumbai and Bolangir in the eastern state of Odisha after the weather department forecast maximum temperatures to rise between 2 degrees and 4 degrees Celsius.“The BJP has not fielded the right candidate for the Lok Sabha, but we are voting ... with Modi in mind,” said 55-year-old Odisha farmer Girish Mishra, referring to the lower house of parliament.Modi, accused by opponents of targeting minority Muslims to please hardline voters, resolved in a television interview after the fourth phase to “not do Hindu-Muslim (in politics)”.He has repeatedly accused the Congress of plans to extend welfare benefits to Muslims at the expense of disadvantaged tribal groups and Hindu castes, a claim the opposition party has denied. \nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi, a hardliner long seen as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was killed in a helicopter crash in mountainous terrain near the Azerbaijan border, officials and state media said on Monday.The charred wreckage of the helicopter which crashed on Sunday carrying Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian was found early on Monday after an overnight search in blizzard conditions.“President Raisi, the foreign minister and all the passengers in the helicopter were killed in the crash,” a senior Iranian official told Reuters, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.Raisi’s death was later confirmed in a statement on social media by Vice President Mohsen Mansouri and on state television.State TV reported that images from the site showed the aircraft slammed into a mountain peak, although there was no official word on the cause of the crash.State news agency IRNA said Raisi was flying in a US-made Bell 212 helicopter.Raisi, 63, was elected president in 2021, and since taking office has ordered a tightening of morality laws, overseen a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests and pushed hard in nuclear talks with world powers.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran’s nuclear programme, had earlier sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.PRAYERS, SEARCHESRescue teams fought blizzards and difficult terrain through the night to reach the wreckage in the early hours of Monday.“With the discovery of the crash site, no signs of life have been detected among the helicopter’s passengers,” the head of Iran’s Red Crescent, Pirhossein Kolivand, told state TV.Earlier, the national broadcaster had stopped all regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country.Video showed a rescue team, wearing bright jackets and head torches, huddled around a GPS device as they searched a pitch-black mountainside on foot in a blizzard.Several countries had expressed concern and offered assistance.The White House said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on reports about the crash. China said it was deeply concerned. The European Union offered emergency satellite mapping technology.HARDLINER, POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR TO KHAMENEIThe crash comes at a time of growing dissent within Iran over an array of political, social and economic crises. Iran’s clerical rulers face international pressure over Tehran’s disputed nuclear programme and its deepening military ties with Russia during the war in Ukraine.Since Iran’s ally Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, provoking Israel’s assault on Gaza, conflagrations involving Iran-aligned groups have erupted throughout the Middle East.In Iran’s dual political system, split between the clerical establishment and the government, it is Raisi’s 85-year-old mentor Khamenei, supreme leader since 1989, who holds decision-making power on all major policies.For years many have seen Raisi as a strong contender to succeed Khamenei, who has endorsed Raisi’s main policies.Raisi’s victory in a closely managed election in 2021 brought all branches of power under the control of hardliners, after eight years when the presidency had been held by pragmatist Hassan Rouhani and a nuclear deal negotiated with powers including Washington.However, Raisi’s standing may have been dented by widespread protests against clerical rule and a failure to turn around Iran's economy, hamstrung by Western sanctions.Raisi had been at the Azerbaijani border on Sunday to inaugurate the Qiz-Qalasi Dam, a joint project. Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev, who said he had bid a “friendly farewell” to Raisi earlier in the day, offered assistance in the rescue. \nMoments after the final whistle blew on Juergen Klopp’s managerial career at Liverpool, the much-loved German encouraged the Anfield faithful to celebrate the moment, but embrace the future.Klopp flashed his huge smile throughout a long address to fans after Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in Sunday’s emotional Premier League season finale, and even led the crowd in a song for incoming manager Arne Slot, who has enormous shoes to fill.“Change is good,” the 56-year-old Klopp told the crowd. “And you never know exactly what to expect, but if you go with the right attitude into that, then everything will be fine.“What I want you to sing, I have an idea,” he added, then launched loudly into: “Arne Slot! Na, na, na, na, na!” The crowd sang along.On a day Liverpool fans had been dreading since Klopp announced in late-January he would leave at season’s end, the manager sounded genuinely happy rather than heartbroken.“It doesn’t feel like an end. It just feels like the start, because I saw today a football team playing full of talent, youth, creativity, desire, greed,” he said.“In these few weeks where I have had too much attention, I realised a lot of things. People say I turned them from doubters into believers. That’s not true.“I just said we have to. You did it. Nobody tells you to stop believing. This club is in a better moment than a long time. We have this wonderful stadium, training centre and you — the superpower of world football. Wow.”Klopp’s team, who were on course to give their manager a fairytale ending before a string of bad results last month derailed their title challenge, finished the season third in the table on 82 points, nine behind winners Manchester City and seven behind second-placed Arsenal.Klopp bade farewell to the Anfield faithful having won 305 matches, including penalty shootouts, since joining the Reds in 2015, plus seven trophies including the Champions League in 2019 and a first English League title in three decades in 2020.But he was loved as much for his charisma and passion as his on-field success and it was on full display on Sunday. He was saluted with a guard of honour in the post-game celebrations, and after pausing to wrap an emotional captain Virgil van Dijk in a bear hug, he turned and ran through it again.“It’s a very emotional day,” Van Dijk told Sky Sports. “(Klopp) deserves every bit of love that he’s getting.”Tears rolled down defender Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cheeks while the team stood arm-in-arm and the fans serenaded them with “You’ll Never Walk Alone.”“I’ve never seen or experienced someone who can inspire or motivate with a click of his fingers,” Alexander-Arnold told Sky. “If he told me today it was snowing outside, I’d believe him—that’s probably the best way of putting it.”Klopp famously introduced himself as “the normal one” in his first Liverpool press conference after his hiring, “but he’s definitely a special one for us for the players who played under his leadership,” the team’s Brazilian keeper Alisson Becker said.“His passion, his desire to win things, to achieve things... but he thinks about the personal side also, he wanted to do everything to make the players feel good to play for his team. I have so many good memories.”While Klopp’s departure announcement sent shock waves through the football world, the manager said he felt a sense of relief around his decision. His energy for the job was waning, he said. He could not do it on “three wheels.”He looks forward, he told Sunday’s crowd, to throwing his energy into being a fan.“Obviously I saw a lot of people crying and I will tonight too because I will miss people but change is good,” he said.“You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me. You go all in from the first day. You keep believing. You push the team. I’m one of you now. I love you to bits.”And before the final curtain came down on his time with the Merseyside club, Klopp ran the length of the Anfield pitch for one final round of fist pumps with the crowd, and then pointed with two thumbs to the back of his shirt, which read: “I’ll never walk alone again.” \nManchester City’s insatiable appetite for trophies spells bad news for any club hoping to break the stranglehold Pep Guardiola’s side continue to have on English football.Admirably, Arsenal pushed them very close this season but once again the sight of Guardiola’s players cavorting with the Premier League trophy was the abiding image of the final day.City’s 3-1 victory over West Ham United on Sunday took them to a place not even the great Liverpool side of the 1980s and Manchester United team of the late 1990s and 2000s inhabited.A fourth successive English league title is unprecedented and the big question is who will stop the City march.They have averaged 89.7 points in their last four title-winning seasons and, while Guardiola’s side again failed to threaten the 100 they amassed in 2017-2018, City proved that when the pressure is really on they are almost impregnable.Arsenal and Liverpool both headed City in the standings in the final months of the campaign, but the champions put together a blistering run of 19 wins and four draws since their last league defeat by Aston Villa on December 6.No one was really surprised because in 53-year-old Guardiola City have a manager obsessed with perfection.“It’s a bit demanding at times. It’s tough, but look what he’s done. He demands a lot every single day,” City’s Norwegian goal machine Erling Haaland said of playing for Guardiola. “If you don’t live up to what he expects you have a big problem.”The Spaniard has now won the Premier League title six times in his eight seasons at The Etihad Stadium and perhaps the only glimmer of hope is that he might decide to follow Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp and step away.“The reality is I am closer to leaving than staying. We have talked with the club—my feeling is that I want to stay now. I will stay next season and during the season we will talk,” the ex-Barcelona boss said. “But eight or nine years—we’ll see.”Incredibly, in the 152 Premier League matches City have played across the last four seasons, they have recorded 112 victories with just 17 defeats, racking up 372 goals.That is in a league regarded as the toughest in Europe, where the huge broadcasting deals mean all 20 clubs have the spending power to sign some of the world's best talent.“Pep Guardiola has designed a style of football that is being copied not just around this country, but all around Europe,” former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville told Sky Sports.“Most of all he is a winning machine that instils that in everybody who works with him.”City’s Belgian midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, who along with 23-year-old Phil Foden now has six Premier League titles to his name with City, explained that the secret was quite simple.“The manager sets the tone but this team we enjoy playing with each other. It is not a team with big egos,” he said.“We play around with each other we run like crazy and we just enjoy it. The enjoyment is lasting so that’s it.”It could yet get better for City, with next Saturday’s FA Cup final against Manchester United still to come, and there will be no slackening off until another trophy is in the bag and a double secured, hot on the heels of last year’s treble. \nSunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nIn June 2020, Nepal’s Parliament ratified a new political map of the country, including geographical territories that were and still remain under the control of India. While some areas in the new map, especially the Kalapani region, were already a subject of dispute between the two countries, the communist government under Khadga Prasad Oli used its two-third parliamentary majority to include areas as far as Limpiyadhura unilaterally. For those who care to look at historical evidence, Nepal had never asserted its claim over Limpiyadhura, which was a territory lost after the Sugauli treaty of 1816. It was only in context to the existing dispute over the origin of the Kali river, which forms an international boundary in the treaty, that Nepal has claimed the Kalapani region and Lipulekh as its territory. India is cognisant of Nepal’s claim, and there is a joint committee looking at these boundary claims, with dialogue also happening at the Foreign Ministry level.Oli’s move in 2020 was not sudden. He had advisors who clearly understood that Nepal did not fulfil the prerequisites for a sovereign claim over most of those territories under the international law, which mandates physical control of the territory with a resident population under active governance. In fact, the only claim that merits a mention, and which Nepal has strongly put across to India, is the credible evidence regarding Nepal governing the villages in the Kalapani region until a few decades back. Specifications of the evidence aside, what is clear is Nepal’s claims in the Kalapani region have been acknowledged by India and well-documented by the joint committee.Oli’s come-back politicsWhen Oli came to power after the 2017 elections, he was riding on the wave of hyper-nationalism he had managed to stoke in the aftermath of the 2015 Indian blockade. While the Madhesh-based parties had indeed initiated the border obstruction to pressure Kathmandu’s political centre into conceding to their demands on the new constitution, the Narendra Modi government that had just come to power in New Delhi was blamed for actively enforcing the blockade. This is a claim India continues to deny. Whatever the truth, the blockade provided an opportune moment for Oli, whose political career was ailing at the time. He not only managed to sideline his bête noire, Madhav Kumar Nepal, inside the party but he also struck a deal with politically insecure Pushpa Kamal Dahal to cobble up a two-thirds majority in the 2017 elections. What happened next has continued to haunt Nepal’s relationship with India. Oli, of all the communist leaders of his generation, best understands that if there is one issue that could mobilise the population across the country, it is our collective sense of insecurity against what we perceive to be India’s over-reach and micro-management of Nepali politics. An average Nepali consumes Indian products, watches Bollywood movies, and supports an IPL team, all the while disdaining what they consider Indian interference in Nepali affairs.To be fair, such a mindset is not uncommon in a relationship between two countries that are disproportionate in geography, demography, economy or military capability. The tendency of the political class to weaponise public sentiments and insecurity against a larger neighbour for domestic electoral politics is not uncommon either. Autocratic and populist regimes across the world have consolidated their hold over power by stoking hate or fear against a perceived enemy state, painting their domestic opposition as weak and incapable of defending national interests. The definition of the enemy state and the national interests, in such cases, are often dictated by those in power to suit their divisive politics.When Oli refused to concede party or government leadership, Pushpa Kamal Dahal wrecked the mighty two-thirds government with the help of the disgruntled Madhav Kumar Nepal faction. Nepali Congress had no issues cashing in on this division, allowing the party’s president, Sher Bahadur Deuba, to become the Prime Minister in July 2021. Upon becoming premier, Deuba and his coalition partner Dahal did all they could to normalise the relationship with New Delhi. There was little talk about the controversial map or the Eminent Persons’ Group (EPG) report, which had both become irritants in the bilateral relationship. After the 2022 elections, when Dahal became prime minister, New Delhi reciprocated by supporting Nepal’s ambitions to invest in large infrastructures and export power in the Indian market and potentially to Bangladesh. In doing so, New Delhi expected to regain some of the trust it had lost after the 2015 blockade. But Oli is a seasoned politician, a political maverick who can see two steps ahead of his competitors. He sensed Dahal’s distrust of his coalition partners, his personal anxieties and insecurity about the future of his party, which he felt was dealt an under-hand during the division of electoral seats. China, which had openly helped in cobbling up the previous left unity, has been more cautious this time. But there is plenty to read between frequent delegations shuttling between Kathmandu and Beijing over the past year. In any case, Oli convinced Dahal to leave the Nepali Congress coalition and continue in power with UML’s support, with a vague promise of a long-term (electoral) partnership. Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajwadi Party and the newly established Rastriya Swatantra Party were offered attractive cabinet positions in exchange for their support as well. Yadav, though, has left the coalition after the split of his party. Perilous brinkmanship If Pushpa Kamal Dahal believes that the UML chairman took all the trouble of bringing down the NC-led coalition just to watch the game from the sidelines, he needs to change his advisors. He may have generously allowed Dahal to continue on the throne, but it is clear who is setting the rules of the game. The recent decision by the current government to include Nepal’s new map in its currency note has Oli’s footprints all over it. However, his brinkmanship with India could have serious ramifications for the country. Not only will such misadventures jeopardise Nepal’s crucial economic interests, especially in the cross-border energy market where the private sector has invested billions of dollars, our ambition to access the trade route to Bangladesh and further east will not see the light of the day.As the war in Ukraine drags on and the conflict in Gaza worsens, Washington is already zooming out from the Indo-Pacific region. This could provide a much-needed conducive environment for a rapprochement between New Delhi and Beijing, something Indian Prime Minister Modi has hinted at recently. Nepali communists must read the changing geopolitical horizon and understand the days of playing one neighbour against the other may not last for long. Nepal is better off drawing complementarities in its relationship with the two neighbours, allowing them to compete for economic interests on its own terms.  \nClimate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, according to the latest survey report.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, was released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics. It paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say worse is yet to come.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades. Major economic sectors and essential services like health and education in Nepal have felt the repercussions of extreme weather events linked to climate change, the survey said.The statistics office said the sampling used the total number of households from the population census. In total, 6.66 million individual households were included in the frame. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from July to March 2023 among 6,508 households in 326 primary sampling units, encompassing all seven provinces. The statistics office said all the respondents were at least 45 years old and had lived in the survey area for 25 years, forming the sampling frame that included households meeting these criteria across Nepal.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Nepal’s agriculture sector is the mainstay of the country’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of the population. The sector is mainly rainfed and heavily dependent on rainfall.When the rain fails to fall, the GDP takes a tumble. This dependence makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain region (68.7 percent), hill region (50.3 percent), and Tarai region (46.3 percent) also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases. The survey report shows households in altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 metres reported emergingnew crop diseases (60.2 percent) over the last 25 years. This shows diverse factors influence the prevalence of crop diseases across diverse geographical and climatic domains.“The situation is alarming,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office.“The survey was intended to see people’s perception towards climate change, the most burning issue globally,” he said. Climate change literacy among people, mostly in rural areas, is shallow, but some exciting facts exist. “Most of the farmers surveyed are not clear whether climate change is bringing diseases and low yields, but at the same time, they have a coping mechanism knowingly or unknowingly,” said Regmi. For instance, farmers have changed the cropping pattern. “If they think rainfall will be below normal or drought, they switch to another crop.”The survey shows that 35.8 percent of the households surveyed were aware of climate change. Across all three geographical domains, the number of households unaware of climate change is significantly high, with the highest number being in the mountain region (70.9 percent). The sex-disaggregated data indicate that most male (61.3 precent) and female (74 percent) respondents were unaware of climate change impacts.The accessibility of early warning information among the people is weak.In urban municipalities, 16.3 percent of households received early-warning information, while 83.7 percent of the respondents did not receive any information regarding a disaster occurring shortly. Altitude-wise, households in low-altitude regions have received more early-warning information than those in the higher-altitude areas. The survey results show a significant impact of climate change on Nepal's water resources over the last 25 years. Climate change has notable implications for the country's energy transition, as it is actively pursuing a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources. According to experts, the survey report is eye-opening. Nepal plans to generate 30,000MW of electricity by 2035, and the market for Nepal's hydropower is opening up in India and Bangladesh.Many households reported adverse changes and noted their water resources dried up. This phenomenon was observed across all domains and indicates a nationwide decrease in water availability. Respondents experienced a reduction in ground and surface water, primarily attributed to insufficient rainfall and increased drought incidents. According to the survey, 78.3 percent of households observed a decline in rivulets and streams, and 55 percent observed a decrease in wells, springs, and stone spouts. Likewise, 47.7 percent observed changes in water resources due to insufficient rainfall, followed by an increase in drought (20.3 percent), road construction (3.4 percent), deforestation and urbanisation (3.2 percent). In contrast, minimal respondents observed change due to population growth, earthquakes and landslides/soil erosion over the last 25 years.The survey said that over the past 25 years, Nepal has suffered from various natural disasters. Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nProject Sambad, a platform for critical discussions on Nepali society and policymaking, held its first event in Kathmandu on March 14-15.\nThe Siddhartha Art Gallery's \"Sawari Kathahru: Art in Motion\" exhibition showcases the wit and creativity of truck poetry, featuring photographs, a documentary, interviews, and a table game that reflects Nepal's evolving political, religious, and social landscapes.\nParliamentary proceedings have been hindered by a widening rift between ruling and opposition parties over a probe into a cooperative scam, leaving the government facing the threat of issuing the budget through an ordinance if the impasse continues.\nNepali Congress questions Speaker's impartiality after a scuffle in Parliament, alleging biased orders from the ruling UML and suspicions of instigation by KP Oli, delaying the formation of a parliamentary committee over the cooperatives scam.\nA parliamentary meeting intended to resolve an impasse descended into a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers over the scope of a probe into Home Minister Lamichhane's alleged embezzlement.\nNepal's leading parties, CPN-UML and Nepali Congress, engage in heated exchanges over the recent Supreme Court ruling on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land swap controversy, with accusations of corruption and misconduct leveled against each other.\nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n\nA man, who was injured while putting out a fire at Tapeshwar community forest in Godawari Municipality-4, Badikhel, succumbed to burn injuries on Tuesday.According to Senior Superintended of Police Shekhar Khanal of Lalitpur District Police Range, Shankar Pahari died while undergoing treatment at the Kirtipur-based Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre.Another injured, Ramesh Pahari, is being treated at the hospital.Meanwhile, a fire at Ananda forest in Godawari Municipality-6, Lele is yet to be brought under control. A total of 65 patients have been moved to a safer place after the fire spread to the premises of the Anandaban Hospital. \nGlobal Dairy Private Limited has started commercial production of butter milk, known as mohi in Nepali.Mohi, known as mattha in Hindi, a popular fermented dairy drink originating in the Indian subcontinent, is the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream. The dairy plant in Imilia in ward 9 of Buddhabhumi Municipality in Kapilvastu district has been producing 1,000 litres of mohi daily since mid-April. The company said the demand for the drink, a good source of protein and calcium, has been growing.In Nepal, it is consumed especially during the summer. The producer said that traditionally the drink used to be a favourite in villages, but gradually lost its appeal to more popular beverages like Coca-Cola and Pepsi.“That is why we have started the production and branding of mohi,” said Thaneshwor Neupane, chairman of Global Dairy. “We are the first Nepali company to start the commercial production of bottled mohi and label it. We have introduced the product in the market with attractive packaging.”The company has expanded sales and distribution to six districts of Lumbini province. “This is our first phase of expansion. We have planned to go across Nepal,” said Neupane.The brand, ‘Buddhabhumi’, is named after the birthplace of Buddha. Shankar Pandey, finance chief of the company, said that the drinks give energy and refresh people. The retail price is Rs50 per litre bottle. The dairy factory said it has spent Rs15 on each bottle and its labelling, bringing the total cost to Rs38-40 per bottle, Pandey said.“We have given special focus to maintaining the standard and purity of mohi.”Mohi is made from curd recommended by the food technologist. First, the substance that turns milk into curd is tested. After that, the acidic and potential hydrogen levels are tested, and mohi is made only from consumable curd.The curd is then mixed with processed water in a machine until it reaches the right consistency for bottling. The finished product is packaged in sets of 12 bottles and is sent to the market based on demand.“Bottling is also nice, and the taste is also good,” said Punaram Aryal, a consumer from Imilia.The company said 28,000 litres of mohi have been sold so far since its production started last week. The mohi produced is consumable within 5-6 days from the date of manufacture.According to locals, mohi has become a great option to other cold beverages produced by multinational companies. “Public response to the product is positive and this has encouraged us,” Neupane said.The factory currently has been producing 3,000 litres of mohi daily, Neupane said.Rajendra Singh Lodh, a food technologist, said special attention has been given to the purity and quality of the product.In Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, it is also said that drinking mohi after meals makes the body healthy and active. Daily consumption of mohi boosts immunity and improves the digestive system, according to food technologists.Mohi is rich in potassium, calcium, and protein. It also gives the body freshness and hydrates it.Drinking mohi is also considered beneficial for people fighting long-term diseases.Global Dairy, which has been operating for a decade, has started producing mohi as a new product, with an investment of Rs500 million. The company, which has been producing 50,000 litres of milk daily, said it is planning to increase the capacity to 100,000 litres.It aims to produce powdered milk too.“If the marketing of mohi goes well, then it will also be a boon for dairy farmers who often face milk holidays,” said dairy farmer Shiva Gulam Kori of Budhhabhmi municipality.The company has 79 collection centres in Lumbini province and two in Sudurpaschim province, and it has 15,000 farmers associated with it. It sells dairy products by coordinating with around 500 collection centres across the province. The company has provided direct employment to 200 people.Dr Mukesh Chaudhary, the medical chief of Kapilvastu Hospital, said that mohi is more beneficial to health compared to other cold drinks. “It is important to drink mohi for vitamins D and calcium. It hydrates the body and balances the body's temperature.”    \nCimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, achieved a milestone by delivering 50 units of cutting-edge BYD electric vehicles (EVs) in a single day. The company said that on May 18, it sold 50 BYD EVs from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu. The event, filled with excitement and anticipation, witnessed the delivery of BYD ATTO 3 and BYD Dolphin EVs to eager customers, signalling a paradigm shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly transportation solutions in Nepal, the company said in a statement. In a gesture of commitment to customer satisfaction and safety, Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd also introduced the first generation BYD e6, dating back to 2017, as a dedicated roadside assistance vehicle during the handover event. This initiative underscores Cimex's unwavering dedication to providing comprehensive support and services to BYD EV owners, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable driving experience. \nInternet service providers say they are awaiting the full text of the Supreme Court’s ruling to pay the taxes they raised from the public.The service providers (ISPs) raised nearly Rs4 billion in rural telecommunications development fees and royalty charges on maintenance from the public since the fiscal year 2017-18 but did not transfer the amount to the government.The ISPs have been arguing that the former parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had ordered the fees’ waiver.On May 13, the top court scrapped the writ petition filed by Worldlink Communications and ordered the ISPs to pay the government taxes that they had raised from the public.“We will obey the Supreme Court’s verdict. As the writ petition has been scrapped, we are discussing with the Nepal Telecommunications Authority on the amount that ISPs owe to the government and the payment modality,” said Binay Bohra, owner of the Vianet internet service provider.The tug-of-war between the ISPs and the government deprived thousands of people of the service when the Indian vendor on which the ISPs rely for the Internet bandwidth suddenly severed the link for hours.On May 2, Airtel, a leading telecom provider of India, cut upstream services to Nepal after the dispute between the government and ISPs over the payment dispute remained unresolved for months. The disruption started at around 5 pm and the services were restored after around five hours.According to the Internet Service Providers Association of Nepal, Airtel provides around 70 percent of upstream services to Nepal.Airtel agreed to restore the service after the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the regulator, promised to sort out the payment issue ‘responsibly.’For nearly two years, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology has reiterated that unless the ISPs pay the due taxes, it will not recommend the foreign exchange to be made available by the Nepal Rastra Bank to the service providers so they can forward the payment to upstream service providers.The ISPs have not paid the charges as the erstwhile parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had a few years ago ordered the government to exempt them from taxes on non-telecom components like web service, co-location, hosted service, disaster recovery, managed service, data centre, and cloud service.Following the order, in a letter dated July 15, 2018, the licensing department of Nepal Telecommunication Authority wrote to the Inland Revenue Department requesting that internet service providers not be subjected to telecommunication charges for non-telecommunication services.The committee said that internet service providers do not have to pay royalties and Rural Telecommunications Development Fund charges for three fiscal years: 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20.But the auditor general brought the issue to light.Nepal's constitutional supreme audit body pointed out that such fees, which the ISPs have raised from the public, should not be waived and instructed recovery of the charges. Following this, the government wrote to the ISPs to clear the dues.The current Public Accounts Committee has ordered the government to recover the dues from the ISPs.Nepali ISPs owe Airtel more than $30 million (Rs4.3 billion). They defaulted on payments for upstream services a year ago.The Indian vendors also threatened to suspend services starting January 1 this year if Nepali ISPs failed to settle the outstanding dues. However, following a change in government, the issue remains unresolved.The ISPs’ annual transactions near Rs27 billion, with the government earning more than Rs9 billion in revenue under eight headers.Around 10.6 million people use the internet in Nepal through 20 ISPs in the country, including the state-owned Nepal Telecom. ISPs say they provide direct employment to more than 15,000 people. \nNepal’s food safety agency has banned the sales and imports of popular Indian spice brands MDH and Everest with an immediate effect, based on the findings from several countries that they contain ethylene oxide, a cancer-causing chemical. The quality watchdog has also decided to recall and seize products currently in the customs clearance process.The move follows bans by several countries, including Singapore, Hong Kong, and the Maldives, and scrutiny by the Australian authorities.“We decided to ban the spices of the two Indian companies with immediate effect based on scientific evidence from several other countries showing high levels of carcinogenic pesticide ethylene oxide in many spice mixes. This poses a cancer risk,” said Matina Joshi Vaidhya, director general of the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control.“We will allow their sale, imports and distribution once we get clearance from the manufacturing country that they are safe to consume.” Experts say the presence of ethylene oxide, which is a flammable colourless gas with a sweet odour, in the spices, is concerning, as varieties of the products of both companies are easily available in Nepal and are popular too.Ethylene oxide is primarily used to produce other chemicals, including antifreeze. In smaller amounts, it is also used as a pesticide and sterilising agent.Lymphoma and leukaemia are the cancers most frequently associated with occupational exposure to ethylene oxide. Stomach and breast cancers may also be linked to ethylene oxide exposure.Vaidhya said countries have their own acceptable limits for pesticide use. If products are found to exceed the limits set by the department, the department will direct relevant authorities to recall them from the market.The department accordingly issued a circular to agencies on Friday to recall the spices from the market. The quality watchdog has also directed the National Food and Feed Reference Laboratory to prioritise testing for ethylene oxide.Ganesh Agrawal, an official of Jay Ganapati Enterprises in Biratnagar, the distributor of Fish Curry Masala manufactured by Everest Food Products Pvt Limited, told the Post that they knew about the issue through news reports and had planned to stop selling the product. “The sales, however, are not significant.”Earlier this month, Hong Kong and Singapore banned the sale of MDH and Everest spice brands, citing the detection of carcinogenic pesticide ethylene oxide in several spice mixes.India is the world's largest spice producer, consumer and exporter. Zion Market Research estimates India's domestic spice market to be worth $10.44 billion in 2022, and the Spices Board said India exported products worth $4 billion during 2022-23.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 946.42 tonnes of various Everest brand spices from India and other countries, amounting to Rs120 million, in the last fiscal year ending mid-July 2023. Spice imports from India alone amounted to 478 tonnes worth Rs74.65 million. Similarly, the imports of the MDH brand spice amounted to 1,143.76 tonnes worth Rs637.21 million. From India alone, Nepal imported 1,141.96 tonnes of spice worth Rs635 million.Consumer rights activists say that authorities must take urgent action as the issue is related to public health.“As the products that were found to be hazardous to public health in Hong Kong and Singapore are widely available in Nepal too, it would be irresponsible to wait for a test report to prohibit their use,” Jyoti Baniya, chairman of the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights, told the Post in a recent interview.“It will be too late to wait for the report—we should not forget that this is directly linked to public health.”The quality watchdog said they have started inspecting the department stores and groceries to remove the banned spice. \nFor decades, cross-border trade between Nepal and India was traditionally done due to social ties spanning borders. The situation now is different. It’s now an organised commercial informal trade happening at a large scale, according to a research finding. Rice appears to be a key commodity ‘highly informally’ imported from India to Nepal. The research, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, shows that only 40 percent of rice is imported to Nepal from India through a formal channel.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, leading to a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports. In the current fiscal year, the government also introduced a 13 percent VAT on some vegetables, including onions and potatoes.With this variation, the price differences between Nepal and India become 18-20 percent, or rice in India becomes cheaper by at least 18 percent.The paper said that India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west. According to a separate report by the International Food Policy Research Institute, carrying or informally transferring goods has become a full-time profession for many poor families living close to the towns along the Nepal-India border.“Carriers,” many of them women, collect the goods on the Indian side and bring them in via the open border, escaping the formal customs entry points, sometimes on foot, sometimes on bicycles and motorbikes, and always at their own risk.Presenting the report titled ‘Insights into Informal Cross-Border Trade in Agri-Food Commodities in South Asia’, Dikshya Singh, programme coordinator at SAWTEE, a South Asian think tank based in Kathmandu, said the export duty imposed by India on rice in September 2022 followed by an export ban on non-basmati rice in July 2023, fueled the informal trade.The report said that rice, vegetables, chemical fertilisers, and seeds are other agricultural products and inputs that have been largely coming through informal channels.The study reveals that this informal trade is dominated by a small group of traders forming an oligopoly. Moreover, the study indicates that large-scale informal trade is controlled by mafia-style syndicates with political backing.Anand Bagaria, managing director of Nimbus Holdings, said Nepal needs proactive measures to deal with informal cross-border trade. “Since we cannot influence our neighbouring countries’ policies, Nepal needs to be clear about what could be the right balance between inflation, government revenue, and mitigating quality-related risks while dealing with informal trade.”Singh said Nepal heavily relies on informal trade to meet its need for agricultural inputs.The report attributes the illegal import of chemical fertiliser to the persistent shortage in Nepal and cheaper rates in India.The report showed that Nepal needs 800,000 tonnes of chemical fertiliser annually. The country has been able to import 400,000 tonnes formally, and an estimated 200,000 tonnes come through informal channels. According to the report, farmers in Nepal have been informally importing a variety of seeds that are not available locally, especially hybrid seeds of vegetables, mainly due to import restrictions and to avoid non-tariff requirements.SAWTEE conducted surveys at nine customs points, including Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Biratnagar, Nepalgunj, Kakarbhitta, Krishnanagar, Jaleshwar, Suthauli, Maheshpur, and Bhadrapur and the border crossings in their periphery.“The informal trade between Nepal and India is as big as formal trade,” said Paras Kharel, executive director of SAWTEE. Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary, said that gold and silver, areca (palm) nuts, onion and garlic, poppy seed, edible oil, and black pepper are informally exported to India from Nepal. “Informal trade is rising between Nepal and India because of the price differences caused mainly due tariff advantage and tariff differences and non-tariff barriers for formal export.”“The misdeclaration of exported goods from Nepal to India needs to be addressed,” he said. For instance, Nepal exports cabbage to India from Koshi province. As India has restricted the import of other types of vegetables from Nepal, traders are exporting other vegetables like okra, chayote, and chilli under the name of cabbage, Ojha said.Article 2 of the trade treaty between Nepal and India, and the agreement on cooperation to control unauthorised trade talks about controlling informal trade. “During the bilateral discussion, be it commerce level, inter-government committee meetings, or customs director-level meetings, either annually or bi-annually, they discuss informal trade. But there hasn’t been any serious discussion about controlling informal trade,” Ojha said.Nepal raised issues like the informal import of agricultural goods from India to Nepal, while the Indian side brought up issues like the informal import of goods including areca nuts, edible oil, poppy seeds, and black pepper, but no concrete solution has been found yet, according to Ojha. Sabnam Shivakoti, joint secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, pointed out that cross-border trade that was done traditionally due to social ties across borders is not the same as the organised commercial informal trade that is happening now on a large scale. “This has been affecting agricultural and industrial sectors as they have to compete with cheap imports.”According to Shivakoti, an import restriction on dairy products was announced in February 2024 to protect domestic farmers and the dairy industry, but that led to formal imports being diverted to informal channels.Trade experts said that as the Indian government is providing eight types of subsidies on agricultural products, as a result, Nepali products become less competitive even in the domestic market, raising the informal trade to Nepal. \nOver 600 people with respiratory illnesses seek care at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital on Tuesdays and Thursdays when the hospital runs its out-patient service. The number of patients suffering from respiratory illnesses—pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among others—has risen significantly not only in this hospital but those across the country, according to health officials. “Polluted air is the chief culprit for the rapid surge in the number of respiratory illnesses,” said Dr Niraj Bam, an associate professor at the Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University. “Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke.”Of late, polluted air has been taking a huge toll on public health, throughout the globe.A new report published on Thursday in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal, states that polluted air and high blood pressure are leading contributors to the global disease burden. The report, “Global Burden and Strength of Evidence for 88 Risk Factors in 204 Countries and 811 Subnational Locations, 1990–2021: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021,” shows that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent).Likewise, smoking accounted for 5.7 percent, low birth weight and short gestation 5.6 percent and diabetes 5.4 percent of the burden.Low birth weight, short gestation and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing (WaSH) were among the leading risk factors for the younger population up to 14 years, while for older age groups, metabolic risks such as high blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI), high blood sugar and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol had a greater impact.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis. Doctors say particulate matter emitted from construction sites, wildfires, wood burning, agriculture activities, and dusty roads worsens air quality, threatening the health of hundreds of thousands of people across the country.Most forests burn every year during the dry season. Vehicular and industrial emissions and the burning of agricultural residue make the air toxic.A recent report by Save the Children also shows critical linkages between air pollution and multi-faceted hazards for children.The report “Breathless Future: Unveiling the Impacts of Air Pollution on Children and Women in Kathmandu and Saptari” shows the systemic impact of air pollution on various aspects of children's lives. It also explores the effects of air pollution on women and underrepresented groups.“Deteriorating air quality, outdoors and indoors, has exposed children and women to many health hazards—asthma, other lung conditions, coughing, skin disease, nausea, and headache,” reads the report. “Alarmingly, these conditions have led to increased cases of pregnancy loss, child organ underdevelopment, and a general decline in life expectancy.”Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively.The reduction in life expectancy depends on where one lives—7.5 years in Mahottari, 7.4 years in Rautahat and Dhanusha, and 7.2 years in Sarlahi and Bara districts, the AQLI report said. Likewise, the pollution has been shaving 6.7 years off the lives of people residing in Siraha, and 6.2 years in Saptari and Rupandehi districts.Environment experts in Nepal said that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development. Polluted air has for long been taking a huge toll on public health in Nepal but what’s alarming is that the authorities have not taken the issue seriously.“We heard the government’s policies and programmes. There is no mention of the issue of air pollution,” said Bhusan Tuladhar, an environmental expert. “How can we mitigate the effects of air pollution, without addressing the problem?” \nNineteen-year-old Amit, who’s currently in his gap year, started vaping two years ago. He says he isn’t addicted to it—he barely experienced any withdrawal syndrome when he quit it last year, before picking it up again. Amit, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym to protect his privacy, says he vapes just because he wants to.Unlike Amit, Rita (name changed), who is 21, switched to vaping after smoking tobacco for a while. Rita says that since she hopes to quit smoking altogether, she doesn’t mind the Nepal government’s intention to put a blanket ban on e-cigarettes. But doctors say a ban may lead those who smoke vape to switch to smoking tobacco again.As debates continue around the world about the pros and cons of vaping compared to smoking tobacco, the Nepal government earlier this month announced that it was banning e-cigarettes. The National Health Education, Information, and Communication Center (NHEICC), under the Department of Health Services, says it is seeking help from other ministries to enforce the ban. While some vape users the Post talked to said that the ban would help them quit smoking altogether, there are other aspects of the ban that need a more careful consideration for youths’ health, experts say.Meanwhile, some other users said banning vapes makes little sense as tobacco cigarettes are still freely available in the market for people of all age groups. If the government is so concerned about youths’ health, they question, shouldn’t stricter measures be taken to ensure that minors, for instance, don’t purchase cigarettes?Nepal is not the only country to ban e-cigarettes of late. Most recently, the British prime minister announced a ban on all disposable cigarettes, citing risks to youth health following a significant rise in vaping.There are 33 countries that have altogether banned the sale of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), while according to a WHO report published in early 2024, around 74 countries have no regulations on the sale of e-cigarettes.Most countries in the world have a legal age to purchase traditional cigarettes, according to the WHO, while 88 countries have no minimum age limit to buy e-cigarettes.Moreover, the WHO has repeatedly urged countries around the globe to reduce the spread of e-cigarettes. A call to action was published in December last year, urging governments to strengthen regulations on e-cigarettes.Nepal, meanwhile, has no regulations on e-cigarettes. While they haven’t banned e-cigarettes outright, countries like China have imposed a number of regulations, including licensing to sell the products publicly, ban on flavoured products, and imposition of taxes.In a study on the prevalence of e-cigarette usage among undergraduate students in Kathmandu, 21.2 percent respondents said they never used e-cigarettes, while five percent said they currently used cigarettes. An estimation of global e-cigarette use put the number of its users at 82 million worldwide, 14.2 million of them in South Asia.Most countries cite e-cigarettes as a contributor to youth smoking.Nepalis do not need to produce an ID to purchase either tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Amit, for instance, was still a minor when he started vaping. That these harmful products are freely available to people of all age groups goes against the Tobacco Products (Control and Regulatory) Act, 2068 (2011), which says that it is illegal to sell tobacco products to those below the age of 18.“A stricter control on the sale of tobacco products is essential to curb smoking among youths,” says Dr Bhakta Bahadur KC, chief of Health Promotion and Tobacco Control at NHEICC. KC adds that to prevent minors and pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to the risks of smoking, from purchasing cigarettes, local governments should introduce provisions on licensing. “This is one way to control smoking in vulnerable groups,” says KC.Moreover, banning e-cigarettes fully may not be possible as they are widely sold through social media and smuggled products might still be available for purchase online. The NHEICC is currently calling on other ministries, including the Ministry of Information and Technology, and the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, to help it ban e-cigarettes as they are imported from foreign markets.“Right now, the NHEICC is focused on banning e-cigarettes as a whole due to its adverse effects on the health of young adults, and its role as a gateway to tobacco smoking,” KC says.But Dr Augraj Uprety, Doctor of Medicine at the BPKIHS Department of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine in Dharan, provides a different perspective. With the ban on vapes, youths may find themselves attracted to tobacco smoking, as a significant number of vape users, like Rita, turn to e-cigarettes, supposedly to protect themselves from the harmful impacts of tobacco cigarettes.“Banning e-cigarette is not a cure-all,” Uprety says. “It is also vital to focus on handling the nicotine-dependence syndrome which both tobacco and e-cigarette users experience.”Both tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly addictive chemical, but tobacco cigarettes contain higher amounts of toxic chemicals than e-cigarettes. But studies show that e-cigarettes are especially harmful for youths as they affect adolescent brain development due to exposure to nicotine, and the aerosol in e-cigarettes has known effects on lungs.Further, there is little knowledge about the long-term impacts of e-cigarettes as it’s a relatively new technology.“I will never say banning e-cigarettes is a bad thing. It is an important move,” Uprety says. “But we also need to conduct a pilot study to figure out the repercussions of a potential ban.” \nAs pre-monsoon rains pick up pace, concerns mount about an imminent outbreak of the dengue disease. All that is required for the disease to flare up are stagnant water and hot temperatures, both already present in various parts of the country.“Dengue vectors are already there in many places across the country,” said Professor Murari Das, an entomologist at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “With the right conditions like water and warmth required for vector breeding available now, we can expect a spike in dengue cases in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said that 57 districts, including three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur—have already reported cases of dengue infection.“On average, around 50 people across the country are becoming infected with the dengue virus every week,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “The number could rise in the coming days, as pre-monsoon rainfall activities have recently increased.”Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease throughout the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Around 1,000 people have already been infected with the deadly disease since the start of 2024, according to officials.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of people infected with the deadly virus do not show any symptoms. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus throughout the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Experts say that this is the right time to prepare and prevent possible outbreaks in the coming days.They say that it will be too late if they wait for a massive outbreak. Authorities concerned should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance and take other measures to cut the risk, according to them. Health Ministry officials said that they have alerted all agencies concerned about the risk of a dengue outbreak.“We have alerted all relevant agencies about the risk of a dengue outbreak in the coming days,’ said Dahal. Authorities and agencies at some local units have started activities to make people aware of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, including launching an awareness drive.”Dengue has become endemic in Nepal, as cases of infection are reported throughout the year. Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities are yet to take it seriously. They believe that this lackadaisical approach is responsible for the spread of the virus. What authorities concerned do most of the time is count the number of infections and deaths, according to them.They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population plans to screen pregnant women for mental health problems, which have been emerging as a leading cause of maternal deaths.Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and prompt treatment will help cut down on maternal deaths that have been rising alarmingly of late.“We plan to start screening from Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital,” said Dr Gauri Shrestha, chief of the Safe Motherhood Programme at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “As part of the pilot, all pregnant women seeking service will be screened from the first and postnatal trimesters.”A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with the majority occurring during pregnancy.The report shows that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications.Nepal had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The report showed 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. The study was carried out in 2021.Every year, hundreds of women in the country succumb to preventable deaths from excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), which have been identified as chief causes of maternal deaths in Nepal.However, the 2021 study also shows that a significant number of maternal deaths are also caused by non-obstetric complications such as intentional self-harm.Of the 611 maternal deaths on which the study was based, 67 percent occurred during and after childbirth, according to the report.The census report shows 33 percent of the total maternal deaths occurred during pregnancy, six percent died during childbirth and 61 percent during the postpartum stage.Of the total maternal deaths, nearly a half (47 percent) occurred in Lumbini and Madhesh provinces. The report shows that 10 percent of the victims were 15 to 19 years old. Fifty-seven percent of the deaths happened in health facilities and 26 percent at homes. Of the total maternal deaths, 412 women (53 per cent) went to four antenatal care visits, and of the 173 women who died between seven to 42 days, 45 percent had received postnatal care.As part of its efforts to reduce maternal deaths, the Health Ministry has made it mandatory for women to make eight antenatal care visits and three postnatal care visits.Of the total maternal deaths, six percent (37 women) had undergone abortion or suffered a miscarriage. The report shows that 62 percent of the women took maternity services at state-run health facilities whereas 38 percent gave birth at private health centres.The report shows family members of 83 percent of women who died during or after childbirth tried to get hospital care. Forty-eight percent of those who did use hospital services did not deem it necessary to seek institutional care, according to the report.Delay in finding appropriate health facilities (57 percent), delay in reaching appropriate health facilities (33 percent) and delay in getting appropriate health services (40 percent) are three major causes of maternal deaths, the study shows. Of the total maternal deaths, 17 percent were attributed to all three aforementioned causes and 74 percent to at least one of three causes.The report suggested improving the quality of services and the referral system and making ambulances available for emergency calls as possible ways for identifying the risks on time. The report also suggested carrying out maternal death surveillance regularly to reduce preventable deaths.The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes including free institutional delivery service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. The ministry has also distributed misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. “As the annual health budget does not help us carry out screening of mental health programmes in many places, we are starting the programme as a pilot from the Maternity Hospital,” said Shrestha. “This programme will be expanded in the coming years to other districts, as it is impossible to prevent suicide of pregnant women without treatment of mental health problems.”Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nArmed Police Force Club women’s dominance continued in domestic cricket as they defeated Sudurpaschim Province by two runs in a thrilling final to win their fourth consecutive title at the Lalitpur Mayor Women’s T20 Championship at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Saturday.APF have now won all four editions of the championship. They had entered the tournament as the winners of the Prime Minister Cup Women’s National T20 Cricket Tournament. APF have also terrorised the PM Cup winning six out of nine editions.For Sudurpaschim, they have now fallen short in the title match for a third time against APF after also reaching the final in 2021 and 2022. Koshi had reached the final in 2023.In fact, Sudurpaschim, who were chasing 153, almost ended APF’s stranglehold in the championship on Saturday when Kabita Joshi smashed three sixes in the 19th over to leave her side only needing six runs from the last over for a historic victory.Kabita Joshi played an unbeaten innings of 67 runs and Laxmi Saud made 29 not out to take Sudurpaschim from 49-5 in the seventh over to 150-5 (101-run partnership) before the final over, and inch closer to their first title.But the duo ran out of batteries when needed most as they could only manage three runs from the last over, thanks to a tight bowling from Rekha Rawal.Joshi’s 45-ball knock featured seven boundaries and three sixes.Captain Bindu Rawal contributed 19 off 17, while Sabitri Dhami made 12 off nine balls and Samjhana Khadka played 8-ball 10 for Sudurpaschim.Karuna Bhandari took 2-20 including the wicket of dangerous Khadka who had scored two fifties in this tournament.Earlier, APF opted to bat first and posted a big total of 155-4 with the help of half-centuries from openers Rajmati Airee and Sita Rana Magar.Airee scored 50 runs off 46 balls hitting seven fours. Captain Rana Magar cracked eight fours in her 55-ball 74. The opening duo also added 91 runs for the first wicket.National team skipper added nine, Roma Thapa contributed six and Mamta Chaudhary made 10 not out to guide APF to a huge total.Radhika Pujara, Bindu and Ritu Kanoujiya took one wicket apiece for Sudurpaschim. \nTribhuvan Army Club’s Deepak Adhikari and Nepal Police Club’s Rajpura Pachhai won the men’s and women’s half-marathon titles of the 2024 Kantipur Half Marathon on Saturday.Adhikari, who was a runner-up in the 2022 edition, timed one hour seven minutes and 15 seconds to win the men’s 21.1 km race to claim his maiden Kantipur Half Marathon title.Rajpura Pachhai defended the title of the women’s 21.1 km half marathon.

The college run was added to the event from the 2023 edition.The 21.1 km half marathon—the main event of the annual road running event—started from the Central Business Park, the office of Kantipur Publications at Thapathali, and will traverse through Maitighar Mandala, Baneshwar, Tinkune, Koteshwar, Jadibuti, Lokanthali, Ghatthaghar, Thimi, Sallaghari chowk and returned via the same route before finishing at the starting point.The winners of the men’s and women’s half-marathon will bag a purse of Rs100,000 each. The runner-up will receive Rs50,000, while the third-placed, fourth-placed, fifth-placed and sixth-placed runners will get Rs30,000, Rs20,000, Rs10,000 and Rs5,000, respectively.The winner, runner-up and the third-place finisher in the wheelchair category will earn Rs30,000, Rs20,000 and Rs10,000, respectively.The top-three finishers of corporate run and college run will also receive various prizes and gift hampers.Kantipur Media Group first organised the road-running event on February 19, 2011 to commemorate its 18th anniversary. More than 1,000 runners had participated in the first edition.The event has been continued annually since, establishing itself as one of the premier distance running events in the country. \nIsraeli planes and tanks pounded areas across the Gaza Strip, residents said, as White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday amid US calls for a more focused military campaign.Sullivan was expected to press for Israel to go after Hamas militants in a targeted way, not with a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the White House said before the discussions.Israel has been pushing into the city that it says is the last bastion of Hamas forces. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled the area that was one of their few remaining places of refuge.“Across the Gaza Strip, there is no safety,” said Majid Omran who told Reuters his family had fled Rafah and just returned to what was left of their home in the southern city of Khan Younis that they had fled nearly five months ago.“We took our children, grandchildren, and daughters and we came and lived above the rubble of our home. Because there is no place to take refuge here,” Omran told Reuters inside the wrecked property as a woman cooked over a fire.Israeli forces also pushed deeper into the narrow alleyways of Jabalia in northern Gaza overnight and into Sunday, returning to an area that they said they had cleared earlier in the conflict, residents said.The Israeli military has said its operations in Jabalia - the largest of Gaza’s eight historic refugee camps - are precise and meant to stop Hamas from reestablishing its grip there.The Israeli military said it was “operating to identify armed terrorist cells and... conducting dozens of strikes to assist the forces operating on the ground” in the Jabalia area.TALKS, TUNNELS, THREATSAhead of Sunday’s talks, an Israeli official said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his senior aides would try to reach agreement with Sullivan about the need for press ahead with the Rafah push.Past US misgivings about the feasibility of Israel’s humanitarian measures may have been allayed by the evacuation around half of the city’s Palestinians in 12 days, said the official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.“We’ve shown that this is not only necessary, but doable,” added the official.The official said Israel would also air concerns about dozens of tunnels it says its forces have found under Rafah, running into next-door Egypt - which has condemned the military sweep.“These tunnels are used by Hamas to supply itself with weapons and ammunition, and could potentially be used to smuggle out of Gaza hostages or Hamas senior operatives,” Deputy Israeli State Attorney Noam Gilad said during a hearing at The Hague on Friday, in a rare detailing of allegations that Egypt’s state information service previously dismissed as untrue.Netanyahu has said the operation in Rafah, where Israel believes that as much as a quarter of Hamas’ fighting forces are holed up, could be completed within weeks.Washington worries for the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians sheltering there, and has cited a need not just to evacuate them but also to ensure adequate alternative accommodation.At least 28 Palestinians were killed on Sunday, Gaza health officials and Hamas said, most of them in a strike on a house in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip.The Gaza Civil Emergency Service said in a statement rescue teams have so far recovered the bodies of 150 Palestinians killed by the army in recent days, and that 300 houses had been struck by Israeli aerial and ground fire.The October 7 Hamas assault on Israel that sparked the war killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. About 125 of the 253 people abducted in the raid are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza.At least 35,386 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since October 7, according to the enclave’s health ministry. Aid agencies have warned of widespread hunger and shortages of fuel and medical supplies.The US military said on Friday trucks had started moving aid ashore from a temporary pier built by its forces, the first to reach the besieged enclave by sea in weeks.The Popular Resistance Committee (PRC), an armed group that fights alongside Hamas in Gaza, released a statement saying the pier had been built to ease political pressure on Israel, and that any Israeli or US troops on its territory would be considered a legitimate target.On Saturday, Hamas also raised concerns about the pier, warned against any foreign military force in Gaza, but made no direct threats.In March, when President Joe Biden announced his country’s pier construction plans, he said: “No US boots will be on the ground.” \nA helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister crashed on Sunday as it was crossing mountain terrain in heavy fog, an Iranian official told Reuters, and rescuers were struggling to reach the site of the incident.The official said the lives of Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian were “at risk following the helicopter crash”, which happened on the way back from a visit to the border with Azerbaijan in Iran’s northwest.“We are still hopeful but information coming from the crash site is very concerning,” the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.State TV quoted an official as saying at least one passenger and one crew member had been in contact with rescuers.A Turkish drone identified a source of heat suspected to be the helicopter’s wreckage and had shared the coordinates of the possible crash site with Iranian authorities, Anadolu news agency said on X.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran’s nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.Iranian state media said bad weather caused the crash and was complicating rescue efforts. State news agency IRNA said Raisi was flying in a US-made Bell 212 helicopter.The chief of staff of Iran’s army ordered all resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guards to be put to use in search and rescue operations.Earlier, the national broadcaster had stopped all regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country.In the early hours of Monday, it showed a rescue team, wearing bright jackets and head torches, huddled around a GPS device as they searched a pitch-black mountainside on foot amid a snowy blizzard.“We are thoroughly searching every inch of the general area of the crash,” state media quoted a regional army commander as saying. “The area has very cold, rainy, and foggy weather conditions. The rain is gradually turning into snow.”Neighbouring countries expressed concern and offered assistance in any rescue. The White House said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on reports about the crash. Turkey said it had assigned a drone, a helicopter, vehicles and a rescue team after a request by Iranian authorities. The European Union offered emergency satellite mapping technology.HARDLINER, POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR TO KHAMENEIThe crash comes at a time of growing dissent within Iran over an array of political, social and economic crises. Iran’s clerical rulers face international pressure over Tehran’s disputed nuclear programme and its deepening military ties with Russia during the war in Ukraine.Since Iran’s ally Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, provoking Israel’s assault on Gaza, conflagrations involving Iran-aligned groups have erupted throughout the Middle East.Raisi, 63, was elected president in 2021, and since taking office has ordered a tightening of morality laws, overseen a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests and pushed hard in nuclear talks with world powers.In Iran’s dual political system, split between the clerical establishment and the government, it is Raisi’s 85-year-old mentor Khamenei, supreme leader since 1989, who holds decision-making power on all major policies.For years many have seen Raisi as a strong contender to succeed Khamenei, who has endorsed Raisi's main policies.Raisi’s victory in a closely managed election in 2021 brought all branches of power under the control of hardliners, after eight years when the presidency had been held by pragmatist Hassan Rouhani and a nuclear deal negotiated with powers including Washington.However, Raisi’s standing may have been dented by widespread protests against clerical rule and a failure to turn around Iran's economy, hamstrung by Western sanctions.Raisi had been at the Azerbaijani border on Sunday to inaugurate the Qiz-Qalasi Dam, a joint project. Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev, who said he had bid a “friendly farewell” to Raisi earlier in the day, offered assistance in the rescue. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nFrom historical myths to modern femtech apps, the focus of medical products aimed at women is often profit, not well-being. For centuries, women have been bombarded with a relentless marketing push for unnecessary medical products and services that often have questionable benefits for their health.From Victorian-era manuals promising control over a baby's sex to the booming modern-day female technology or femtech app market, the focus seems to be on creating a market of \"worried well\" women rather than addressing genuine health concerns.Women are known to spend far more on health compared to men, with more of women's health services subject to higher out-of-pocket expense—a healthcare cost gap that exacerbates gender-based pay inequalities. Scare-mongering medical marketing may be contributing to this problem by driving more women to unnecessary tests or treatments.Historically, doctors viewed women as the \"sicker sex,\" leading to a surge in medical advice manuals—many focusing on female reproductive health—as early as the 1820s. These manuals, often rife with misinformation, were a prime example of capitalising on women's anxieties. One of the most commercially successful popular medical books of the 19th century gave medical advice to women about how to influence the sex of their child through specific foods and conceptive practices.Another book in the late 20th century sold even more copies with a focus on this same topic. Even as numerous medical experts and research studies had long debunked the notion that the sex of infants could be influenced, products and services purporting to assist women in this flourished.Today this is still the case but in a different form: IVF clinics in some countries provide for women and couples who wish to have a child of a specific sex, by selecting embryos on this basis. It's a costly process: US fertility clinics charge around $4,500 for sex selection—on top of the cost of IVF, which sets patients back around $12,000-$14,000 per cycle.Menopause is another area heavily targeted by marketers. This natural life stage has long been a major focus of gendered commercial targeting—through advice manuals, hormonal balancing programmes and coaching services, and especially through hormonal and pseudo-hormonal products. In 2024, the market for menopause medical products was valued at around $758.5 million, outstripping other medical products marketed at women worldwide by more than double. In Australia, a major 2023 study found there are strong financial incentives to \"catastrophise\" menopause to drive women to purchase treatments. The authors from the Australasian Menopause Society, the Women's Health Research Program at Monash University and Jean Hailes for Women's Health, welcomed the fact \"that perimenopause and menopause are now being discussed publicly\"—but cautioned medical marketers to avoid \"catastrophising\" menopause, \"particularly in the advertising of goods and services, as it could have the unintended consequences of eroding women's resilience and stigmatising women as they approach midlife.\"While there is no doubt that some women suffer disruptive hot flashes and other symptoms in menopause, many do not at all, and known menopause symptoms are claimed to be found only in Western cultures. The globalisation of menopause marketing is therefore creating new markets of \"worried well\" women who otherwise might not consider they needed medicating. Researchers have referred to this as \"disease-mongering\". In the case of menopause products, it may be deeply problematic given the emerging evidence that hormone products taken by midlife women may influence their later risk of diseases of ageing such as dementia and stroke.The rapidly growing femtech industry is another area where some companies are cashing in on women's health—in a way that may not always benefit women as promised. Femtech is a form of women's health technology that has been rapidly growing since 2018. In 2023, the femtech app market was valued at approximately $30 billion and is projected to reach $135 billion by 2032—that is an expected compound annual growth rate of 16 percent.The rise of femtech apps seems like a step forward, offering support for issues like reproductive health or general wellness, which are often overlooked by traditional medicine. Femtech may provide support for some women's health issues that are currently underserved by medical services, such as endometriosis, women's ADHD, and seronegative chronic diseases that often result in women's \"medical gaslighting\".However, the huge profits generated by the femtech industry's expansion raise questions about whether such projects are primarily aimed at improving women's well-being or rather at maximising the potential of women's health concerns as an extractable market. There is growing concern that many women's health apps have inadequate privacy and security practices. Fertility apps, for example, often collect sensitive data about pregnancies and menstrual cycles—and sometimes then share it with others, exposing it to \"re-identification\" and data breach risks. These apps are not always transparent about the data they trade with and collect from other companies.-360info \nThe aspirations of multiple generations are tied to a nation’s development through experience, expertise, skill, new ideas and innovation. This lays the groundwork for a thriving society where each individual plays a vital role. For such a vision to come to fruition, it is essential to effectively utilise human resources. However, the question persists: How can a nation tap into the potential of its young workforce, ambitious achievers, learners, experienced retirees, migrant returnees and vulnerable populations primed for empowerment through education?Consider the management of police and military personnel on the verge of retirement, mainly those retiring in five years. In the past fiscal year, 5,961 police personnel chose voluntary retirement. One wonders what happens to their preparedness for combat and mindset regarding deployment after retirement and when retirement time approaches. The security mindset ingrained in police forces and militaries demands perpetual vigilance, rigorous training and an unwavering commitment to upholding public safety through proactive assessment and decisive action when required. There is a need to balance the seasoned and disciplined attributes they hone over the years.Comprehending the present challenges faced by students in Nepal is another aspect worth considering, as it can offer valuable perspectives on the employment scenario. Recent findings from the first-ever textbook audit report conducted by Education in Every Home, an organisation working on the education sector in Nepal, paint a stark picture: Only 75 percent children complete 8th grade, with a mere 27 percent advancing to 12th grade. How can the diverse youth receive the support they need from the government and society to enhance their thought processes and effectively utilise their potential when they don’t complete their education? Enhancing human resource management for those on the brink of retirement and promoting youth employment demands more than abstract notions. Practical steps are required to unite people of all ages. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and mentorship programmes is paramount. Moreover, it’s imperative to foster connections among eager learners, individuals seeking guidance and those who derive fulfilment from careers like police and military service. By valuing these professions and harnessing the spirit of youth, we can create a more dynamic and impactful community. Yet, beyond these efforts, we must explore innovative strategies to effectively manage human resources and combat unemployment. Tackling unemploymentThe unemployment problem can be tackled in two ways. First, the government can emulate the historical approach of Franklin D Roosevelt, who galvanised the “lost generation” to pioneer civilian conservation corps initiatives in forestry, flood control and infrastructure enhancements in the United States. As Homraj Acharya, a seasoned policy expert with extensive experience in US government and development projects in South Asia, contends, the Roosevelt approach left an indelible mark on the physical, psychological and employability facets of three million individuals enrolled in the programme. Their involvement in economic relief and conservation efforts offers a blueprint for modern initiatives tackling poverty and environmental concerns. Enrollees resided in camps, engaged in various projects and underwent rigorous training and education within the corps. This precedent offers a compelling model for addressing unemployment, poverty and environmental conservation.Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt’s visionary approach, Nepal could mobilise individuals nearing retirement age to establish a development brigade. This could enlist 50,000 individuals with approximately five years left until retirement, comprising 5,000 from the police force, 5,000 from the military and 40,000 from civilian sectors. The government can allocate additional funds to boost the salaries of police and military officers nearing retirement for joining the development brigade. These individuals can undertake infrastructure development, community enhancement, park innovation, river and lake clean up and conservation, road construction, solar panel installations, reforestation, herbs production and processing and unused productive land utilisation. This strategic initiative addresses unemployment and capitalises on valuable skills and expertise for national advancement. By offering meaningful employment opportunities in these sectors, Nepal can harness their skills and experience, reducing unemployment rates. This targeted approach would ensure continued workforce contribution and alleviate the financial burden on social welfare programmes, ultimately promoting more excellent economic stability and societal resilience.Second, to actively engage youth and students in meaningful work, introducing service learning—an educational approach—can inspire them to participate in community-based projects, nurturing awareness, empathy, critical thinking skills, leadership abilities, teamwork, cultural competence, communication skill and a sense of social responsibility. The mandatory service-learning project for high school students can be easily connected to the development brigade initiative, suggests Acharya. The programme, also known as community learning or experiential learning, can foster collaboration between universities, businesses, nonprofits and government entities, benefiting the local community. Through service-learning courses, students earn credits while undertaking hands-on experiences such as office work, fieldwork, journaling and reflection papers. They can expand professional networks, cultivate friendships, enhance well-being, build confidence, confirm career interests, and explore new fields of study. Introducing the concept of service learning, which can later evolve into the digital literacy brigade, can facilitate a smooth transition from acquiring practical skills to addressing unemployment for the youth and students of Nepal. As students engage in hands-on experiences during service-learning courses, they cultivate crucial skills for navigating the generational realm, enhancing employability and contributing to workforce readiness. This will ultimately benefit the country through a more skilled and capable workforce fostering economic improvement. Such initiatives provide practical solutions and promote a unified responsibility for societal progress. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and meaningful employment opportunities shall ensure that everyone, regardless of age or background, can meaningfully contribute to the nation’s advancement. By grasping the importance of intelligent human resource management and investing in the growth of citizens, Nepal can build a rock-solid base for a vibrant and challenging society.

While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nPeople lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. \nThe third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit starts today. At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepal’s political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investors—from India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Group—were interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Let’s invest in Nepal. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nOur attention has been drawn to a news report published by The Kathmandu Post regarding our operations in Helambu (‘Helambu administration says Melamchi project didn’t pay promised tax’, March 31).Quoting the rural municipality, the paper writes, ‘Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, the Chinese contractor company of the project, has not paid for the resources—slates, stones, soils and other riverbed materials—used while constructing Ambathan dam and other infrastructures in Helambu Rural Municipality Ward No 1.’ Our main objection goes with this sentence of the news. Sinohydro began completing the uncompleted infrastructures of the Melamchi Water Supply Project after making a formal agreement with the concerned agencies of the Government of Nepal. We have signed the terms and conditions and we assure you that we abide by the clauses mentioned in the agreement. As a construction company, we managed construction materials from different legal sources. Some materials were imported from foreign countries while some of them were purchased locally and also some of them is recycling of discarded bulk rock and soil from the tunnel or dam excavation period. As mentioned in the news, the company used slates, stones, soil and other riverbed materials in the infrastructure, but all these materials were used under construction for three major purposes. The first one is aggregate used for mixing concrete and backfill work which were legally bought from local vendors and suppliers with fully paid taxes. The second one is backfill stone used for gabion wall work. The last one is the hard stone used for laying weir lining. The latter two were recycled excavated mucking rock heaped up in the construction field rather than the river bed materials. For the aggregate, the company has paid all the vendors and suppliers for the materials they supplied and we believe that all of the vendors and suppliers are satisfied with the company. The entire bill, invoices, payment receipts, dispatches and all other documents of transactions and payments concerning the local and the foreign vendors and suppliers are transparent, and are kept safely in the company’s office. The news report is misleading, and should be amended.Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, via email \nWe understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019. Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal \nI am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25). I would like to add that much of what we achieved at SOAS University of London would not have been possible without the contribution of my colleague Krishna Pradhan. Pradhan taught Nepali at SOAS for 15 years until his own early retirement in 2019, and was greatly admired by the many students who learned so much from him. His presence at SOAS also enabled me to develop courses in Nepali literature, history and culture alongside the essential language courses. Sadly, none of this will be available to future generations of students in the UK.Michael Hutt,Emeritus Professor of Nepali and Himalayan Studies,SOAS, University of London \nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.
