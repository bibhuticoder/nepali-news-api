Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAt least 140 people have died and 2,268 families have been affected by floods and landslides since the June 10 onset of the monsoon this year. Among the affected families, hundreds have been displaced from their homes. Owing to the government’s apathy, those who have been taking refuge in schools, community homes and in barns of the neighbours and relatives have been deprived of immediate relief money to build temporary shelters.“We don’t have the budget even to provide an immediate relief amount to those displaced in various disasters,” said Anil Pokhrel, chief executive officer of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). “Hundreds of families are still waiting for relief money so that they can build makeshift shelters.”Living in schools, community homes and cattle sheds for a long time is not easy. School administrations often ask the displaced people to vacate, as their presence disrupts regular classes. Officials concede that displaced people make daily rounds of the local authorities and homes of elected representatives, hoping to get the first tranche of relief amounts, but they return disappointed.“We have asked for Rs250 million to provide immediate relief to the displaced, so that they can start building temporary shelters, but the Ministry of Finance has released only Rs30 million. This is insufficient to meet the needs of hundreds of victims,” said an official at the authority, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Officials admit that the authority is unable to release relief money not only for those displaced during the ongoing monsoon, but also for the victims of the rain-related disasters from 2020.They say the number of disaster victims, who have been waiting for relief amounts, is in the thousands.“There are over 1,700 displaced families in our district,” said Rabiraj Dhital, Information officer at District Administration Office, Sindhupalchok. “Of the total number of displaced, around 1,000 have received the first tranche to begin building houses, and 400 have received the second tranche. The reality is that most victims’ homes remain unfinished due to the authorities’ failure to offer timely relief, leaving them in pitiable conditions.”The government has decided to provide Rs550,000 to the disaster victims. Of this amount, 15 percent will come from the respective local units, 30 percent from the provincial government, and 55 percent from the federal government.“Had the federal and provincial government agencies told us that they would not provide anything, we would have made a decision on the relief amount ourselves,” said Aitaman Tamang, chairman of Melamchi Municipality. “Every day, displaced people come to my office and even to my home asking for relief, but I can’t make any decisions.”Officials at the NDRRMA said that the delay by the Cabinet in approving recent changes in relief-related guidelines is the main reason displaced people haven’t received relief money. “Those displaced by the Jajarkot earthquakes got Rs50,000 in immediate relief to start building temporary shelters,” said chief executive officer Pokhrel. “The guidelines’s approval would allow similar support for families affected by other disasters, particularly floods, fire, and landslides.”Pokhrel said that the guidelines have now been submitted for the Cabinet’s approval, and once approved, the authority will be able to provide similar support to families affected by floods and landslides.Nepal is highly vulnerable to natural disasters like earthquakes, landslides and floods. The country, however, struggles to effectively manage large-scale disasters, experts say. They say the reactive approach of the authorities concerned is responsible for the loss of lives and property.The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has forecast above-normal rains and above-average temperatures the monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Several districts have already experienced incidents of landslides, floods and lightning since the monsoon season began.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, at least 1,140 people have died, while 120 others are missing due to landslides, floods, and lightning since June 10.Officials at the authority said 86 people—41 males and 40 females—have been killed in landslides, 26 in floods—11 males and 15 females—and 23 more in lightning strikes. Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.The NDRRMA estimates that 1.81 million people and 412,000 households will be affected by monsoon this year. Of them, 83,000 households will be directly hit, and 18,000 families will require rescue from monsoon-related disasters. \nMPs have raised serious concerns over the delays in implementing air safety measures, blaming the government for making Nepal’s civil aviation notorious worldwide. Sunday’s parliamentary deliberation comes in response to the July 24 crash of Saurya Airlines CRJ-200 that killed 18 people. The flight captain miraculously survived the crash as the cockpit broke off upon impact.The clips circulating on social media sites show that a minute after takeoff, the plane went out of control just a few hundred feet off the ground.The aircraft tilted to the right, with its wing tip hitting the ground in seconds before the plane swerved to its left and hit a container. By the time the plane came to rest in the ravine, it had already been engulfed in a huge ball of fire.“120 people have been killed in the past two years in air disasters. How can anyone forget the pain?” questioned Nepali Congress lawmaker Sanjay Kumar Gautam.He questioned the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal's role. “What is it? A regulator or a service provider? What's its role?“Where are the civil aviation bills? We need to bring the bills to Parliament immediately.”Two long-pending aviation bills—the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Bill and the Air Service Authority of Nepal Bill—envisage splitting Nepal’s aviation body into two entities—service provider and regulator, a condition for Nepal to be struck off the European Commission’s air safety list.The government first announced the proposal in its Three Year Interim Plan 2007-08 to 2009-10, which stated, “In the context of the completion of the study on the institutional strengthening of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, which has been working as the service provider in civil aviation, airport operator and regulator; implementation of doable recommendations suggested by the report are being considered.”Since then, every periodic plan and policy, including the annual budget, has prioritised separating the civil aviation body. But the idea has never been implemented.Nepali Congress Lawmaker Rajendra Bajgain informed the House that there have been seven air accidents in the past two years alone. He said the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has asked to separate regulatory and service work in Nepal’s air service. “But that has not been done.”“Look at the situation of the airport of Nepal’s capital city. Nepal’s tourism is in a coma due to the frequent crashes. Corruption has plagued the aviation industry,” he told Parliament, demanding immediate reform measures so that people would not have to die while flying.Lawmaker Sunita Baral, the whip of the CPN-UML Parliamentary Party, said that the risk to Nepal’s air safety is increasing. “The crashes have been taking place one after another. This will seriously affect the tourism industry.”“A flight comes down within a minute of take-off. How does that happen?”She said that Nepal has seen tourism as a catalyst for economic prosperity. “But if air travel is unsafe, it sends a bad message.”Baral said that the investigation commission should probe the matter seriously.However, as MPs have expected, a probe commission cannot blame a person or to prosecute them even if it finds them guilty. Experts say that under ICAO Annex 13 to the International Civil Aviation Convention, states must investigate an air accident and incident or delegate the responsibility of looking into accidents in their territory to another entity.However, the sole objective of an Annex 13 investigation is to prevent accidents and incidents and generate safety data and information to avoid similar accidents or incidents in the future. Therefore, Annex 13 investigations do not concern themselves with apportioning blame or liability.Any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability will be separate. In Nepal, there is no single example of a judicial or criminal proceeding in 108 air incidents spanning the country’s 71-year-old aviation history. The civil aviation service started in Nepal in 1953 with three old American-made DC-3 Dakotas belonging to an Indian company. After five years, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation was established.House members on Sunday wanted an investigation so that those responsible for such disastrous incidents are punished. However, that’s possible only when the court or the government pursues criminal charges for operators and regulators for failing to comply with the rules. In a recent example, Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a US criminal fraud charge stemming from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners, angering the families of the hundreds of passengers killed who had wanted the case to go to trial.In October 2018, 189 people were killed when Lion Air Flight 610 fell into the Java Sea off Indonesia. In March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa airport, claiming 157 lives.Another lawmaker, Purna Bahadur Gharti, also demanded a fair investigation into the crash. Lawmaker Rajendra Lingden questioned how non-technicians were allowed to board the ferry flight. The plane was scheduled to fly to Pokhara for C-check, heavy maintenance. “It looks like even the regulator was unaware of who was on board.”He pointed to the regulator’s negligence. “We have also heard that the civil aviation body hastily allowed the operation of the new Pokhara International Airport in January last year.”On January 15, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed while approaching the airport. The Post, too, had reported that flight calibration, which tests all equipment at the new airport, had not recommended landing from the west, the path followed by the Yeti flight.Experts at that time had pointed out how the flight procedure was not published. Airlines had very little information on airport procedures and data.No evaluation was carried out as required by the ‘safety management system’, neither by the civil aviation regulator, as an airport service provider, nor by the airlines.“The civil aviation body misused its regulator role to operate the airport, neglecting safety requirements. It was a serious crime and mass murder, and subject to criminal investigation,” one aviation expert had said at the time.Speaking in the House on Sunday, Lawmaker Prabhu Sah said that the frequent crashes have sent a message that Nepal’s air safety is poor. “The relevant agencies should be held responsible and accountable for this.” \nFive people, including three members of a family, are missing in a landslide at Gumda in ward 5 of Dharche Rural Municipality in Gorkha district, on Sunday.The landslide triggered by heavy rains swept away an agricultural farm and a house at around 3am. The landslide started from the Nansen Community Forest just above the settlement.According to the District Police Office in Gorkha, farm owner Jit Bahadur Gurung (37), his wife Kanchhi Gurung (35), his father Sulal Kanchha Gurung (60), Ramesh Gurung (33) and tractor driver Ramesh Pariyar are missing in the nature’s fury. Two others were injured.“Search is on for the missing people with the help of an excavator. But the rescuers could not locate them till the evening,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Ramesh Kumar Shrestha on Sunday. He said police teams were dispatched from the Barpak and Machakhola police posts to the incident site.The local people and the security personnel of the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army have been searching for the victims. “The search has been difficult as the debris buried a large area,” said Shrestha.According to the locals, they heard a bang apparently of the landslide that instantly buried the agricultural farm and another house. “My house is near the landslide. I was woken up by the sounds of some stones hitting the tin roof, and saw that the mudslide had already buried the farm and another house,” said Sanjaya Gurung, a local. “Some workers working at a local hydropower project had been staying in Jit Bahadur’s house. Some of them survived as they could flee on time,” he added.Thirty-year-old Dilip Gurung and 27-year-old Chham Bahadur Gurung were injured in the incident and were found only in the morning. They sustained injuries while attempting to flee the landslide.“It is suspected that the people staying upstairs ran away while those staying on the ground floor went missing in the incident,” said Raj Gurung, a local involved in the search operation.The injured duo were flown to Kathmandu for further treatment. According to DSP Shrestha, the injured were taken to Kathmandu by a chopper of Kailash Helicopter Services. Dilip Gurung, who has multiple injuries, is in critical condition, while Chham’s condition has been reported to be stable. They are receiving treatment at Grande Hospital in Kathmandu, said police.Meanwhile, landslides and floods disrupted vehicular movements on various roads in different parts of the country on Sunday.The Dumre-Besisahar and Besisahar-Chame road sections in Lamjung district were blocked for hours. A landslide at ward 6 of Besisahar Municipality blocked the Besisahar-Chame road, which is the only route connecting Lamjung with Manang district and leads to the northern parts of the district.Transportation resumed in the late afternoon after the security personnel cleared the debris in both the Dumre-Besisahar and the Besisahar-Chame road sections. “Vehicular movement began after repairing the damaged roads,” said Police Inspector Meghnath Chapagain.Landslides erupted in multiple locations, including Dalal Kshetra, Udipur Bazar, Andheri Khola, and near the Nepali Army Gate along the Dumre-Besisahar road section.According to the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, heavy rainfall was recorded in Besisahar, Khudi Bazar, Kunchha, Gharedhunga, and several other areas of Lamjung for three hours starting from 4:30am on Sunday.Similarly, landslides disrupted two routes connecting Hetauda with Kathmandu. According to the police, the Kanti Highway was obstructed in several areas due to the landslides.Deputy Superintendent of Police Lakshmi Bhandari of the District Police Office, Makawanpur, said they are coordinating with the roads department to resume traffic along the road.Similarly, the Hetauda-Bhimphedi-Kulekhani road section was also obstructed due to a landslide in ward 4 of Bhimphedi Rural Municipality.Likewise, the Charikot-Singati road section was blocked due to damage from heavy rainfall.The Area Police Office at Singati, said parts of the road collapsed and were washed away by landslides. With the obstruction in vehicular movement, communication with the northern region has also been disrupted.The police said alternative routes in the rural parts are also blocked due to rain, creating difficulties in transportation. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nNepal’s swimmer Duana Lama failed to progress beyond the Heat in the women’s 200 m freestyle event at the Paris Olympics 2024 on Sunday.Lama took 2 minutes 20.74 seconds to complete the distance, finishing last in the Heat 1 and in the 30th position overall at the Paris Aquatics Centre. A total of 31 swimmers representing 27 countries had entered the event.Players with top 16 times in the Heat qualified for the semi-finals.Lama’s timing in Paris could not even beat her previous best of 2 minutes 12.46 seconds.Gaurika Singh holds the national record in the women’s 200 m freestyle with 2:11.94 seconds.Coach Nayana Shakya said Lama was suffering an ankle injury which affected her performance in the pool.“She arrived at the pool following a three-day treatment and physiotherapy. But she bravely did it,” said Shakya.Lama’s exit from the Heat is not surprising however. Since making a debut in Atlanta 1996, a total of 13 swimmers have now represented Nepal in the Olympics swimming pool but none have succeeded in progressing past the Heat.Alexander Shah, who is competing in the men’s 100 m freestyle, is in action on Tuesday.-Nepal finish 42nd in shooting-Shooter Sushmita Nepal also could not do much as she finished in the 42nd position in the women’s 10 m air rifle qualification event.Nepal scored 104.2 in the first series, 101.7 in the second, 100.7 in the third, 99.9 in the fourth, 102.2 in the fifth and 98.8 in the sixth for a total score of 607.8 at the National Shooting Centre in Chateauroux.Only Luna Solomon of the Refugee Olympic Team finished below her with a score of 601.2.Only the top eight shooters reached the final round.Shooter Nepal holds the national record of 619.1 in the event which she set during the selection tournament of the 19th Asian Games. Nepal has regularly participated in shooting at the Olympics since Seoul 1988—except for Rio 2016. The country has sent women’s shooters in the 10 m air rifle event to all the Olympics except for Rio 2016 and Athens 2004—Nepal did not participate in shooting in Rio and sent men’s athletes in the 10 m air rifle event in Athens— but none has made it to the finals.-Prince Dahal lose to world number two Axelson-Nepal’s badminton star Prince Dahal lost his opening match of the Group P to Tokyo 2020 gold medallist and Rio 2016 bronze medallist Viktor Axelson of Denmark.Dahal, who is ranked 172 in the Badminton World Federation’s men’s singles rankings, lost the game 21-8, 21-6 to the Danish world number two at the Porte de la Chapelle Arena in Paris.Dahal, who entered the Paris 2024 on universality spot, will meet Ireland’s 43rd seed Nhat Nguyen on Monday and Israel’s 58th seed Misha Zilberman on Tuesday.A total of 41 players (from 36 countries)—split into 13 groups of three or four—are competing in the men’s singles badminton.

On the one hand, there is international and national excitement over the rising number of tigers, on the other, people are still dying from tiger attacks. The latest tiger census in Nepal conducted in 2022, counted 355 tigers. After people continue to die in tiger attacks in Bardiya and Banke, the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC) has started a behavior change campaign in late 2021 to educate residents of Banke and Bardia national parks, Khata Protected Area, and the surrounding buffer zone. There are 19 youths spearheading the campaign in Bardiya, while nine local youths are involved in Banke. They are training the local residents on how to coexist with tigers and fostering behavior change. Similarly, five youths are leading the campaign in the Khata Protected area of Bardiya. The work and activities of the youth can also be followed on the Facebook page titled 'Behavior Change Campaign'.Behavior change campaigns in Banke and Bardiya serve as important bridges to mitigate the risks posed by tigers to local communities. Since 2021, a youth-led poaching control mobilization campaign has been active in these two districts. Youth who do well in the campaign are also included in the behavior change campaign. One such participant is 35-year-old Kamal Khadka. Khadka, a youth leader of the 'Behavior Change Campaign' started in Bardiya from 2021, educated the people of Auri in ward 8 of Barbardiya Municipality about tigers. Using photos for his lessons, he showed a photograph of a tiger to more than 50 locals, from children to the elderly, gathered in the 'buffer zone' area of Sompur forest in Auri. “Look, our lives are intertwined with the forest. We cannot survive without it. These tigers and other wild animals are not like us. They don't change their ways. So we need to change our daily activities. Rather than confronting these animals, we should learn to coexist. We need to change our behavior accordingly,” he told them.Umesh Paudel, assistant natural resource conservator of NTNC's Bardiya National Park, says that the reason for starting the behavior change campaign is to prevent tiger attacks. “If you look at the statistics, the number of deaths due to tiger attacks increased in 2019 (post-Covid) in Banke and Bardiya. That year nine people died and three were injured. In 2020, six people died and eight were injured. In 2021, thirteen people died and one person was injured. What this indicates is that locals who had gone elsewhere or abroad for work returned home during the Covid pandemic. And more people entered the forest, leading to a rise in tiger attacks and deaths and injuries,” he said.Paudel believes that the behavior change campaign, supported by local youths, has been effective in mitigating human-wildlife conflicts. Over the past four years, hundreds of locals have been trained on how to coexist with tigers and other animals. In 2022, nine people died and 14 were injured in tiger attacks. In 2023, five people died, and this number dropped to just one in 2024.Paudel said, “It is not that the number of deaths due to tiger attacks has stopped completely, but the behavior change campaign has proven effective in reducing incidents. It educates people living in and around Banke and Bardiya on how to avoid tiger attacks, safely enter the forest, and respond if they encounter a tiger.” If we look at the data of the last six fiscal years, tiger attacks have killed 68 people nationwide. According to the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, 10 people were killed by tiger attacks in the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, 12 people died in 2022-23; 21 in 2021-22; 13 in 2020-21; eight in 2019-20; and four in 2018-19.“With the increase in the number of deaths due to tiger attacks, managing the situation has become a major challenge. The statistics are alarming, but efforts are being made to reduce incidents by raising awareness in Banke and Bardiya areas,” says Ajit Tumbahanphe, conservation officer in the Bardiya conservation program. “The behavior change campaign is proving very effective. The campaign was launched post Covid to ensure that tigers and humans can coexist, and so far more than 10,000 local residents have benefited from it,” he added. After Khadka's interaction with the locals, 76-year-old Pradeep Kumar KC remarked that such a programme has greatly benefited the communities. He said educating the younger generation alongside will help prevent future incidents. “We have a habit of going to the forest alone, not exercising restraint when entering the forest, and doing things on our own accord. This interaction has taught us how we can coexist with animals, including tigers, in the forest.” Sita Rani, who is also a tiger-attack victim, is one of the participants in the campaign. A tiger killed her two goats. After the interaction, she said, “Now I know what to do when I go to the forest or see a tiger.” Member-Secretary of NTNC Naresh Subedi believes that the conflict between tigers and humans can be reduced if the necessary and preferred prey species for tigers are available in reserves and parks. This, he claims, will significantly reduce tiger-human conflicts. “Our plan is to implement science-based conservation in Nepal.” “The conflict between tigers and humans is how to change it into coexistence,” Subedi said. The National Trust for Nature Conservation helps in managing potentially problematic tigers through a proactive monitoring system.’ END  \nA new bird species has been spotted in Nepal. A Spotted Flycatcher (Muscicapa striata) was discovered at an altitude of 3,650 meters in Upper Mustang on July 12.Wildlife photographer Sanjay Tha Shrestha and nature guide Shankar Tiwari first sighted the bird and reported it to ornithologists with photographs. A team of national and international ornithologists confirmed that the bird is a new species for Nepal, according to Hathan Chaudhary, president of the Nepalese Ornithological Union.Shrestha and Tiwari spotted the bird at 8:58 am on July 12 near Lo Manthang in the Annapurna Conservation Area, Mustang district. They provided detailed information and photographs of the new bird to the Nepal Bird Record Committee, which tracks new bird species in Nepal. After consulting with the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and both national and international bird experts, the committee concluded that the bird is a new species for Nepal, according to committee chair Tulsi Subedi.The committee has named the bird ‘Taludharse Arjunak’ in Nepali, based on its English name, Spotted Flycatcher. This name was chosen due to the distinctive head markings that make it easier to identify. With this addition, the total number of bird species recorded in Nepal has now reached 996.The Spotted Flycatcher is a migratory species. This bird is found in Mongolia, China, Afghanistan, and Pakistan and regularly migrates to the south during the winter.Wildlife photographer Shrestha expressed satisfaction at identifying a new bird. “This has added enthusiasm for bird tourism,” Shrestha said. \nThe Nepali political class is by and large considered immune to public criticism. Even as the amount of flak they face mounts by the day, they appear determined to continue on their own merry way. Otherwise, how can they justify appointing certified criminals and gangsters as ministers? Or picking someone charged with sexual exploitation to a top constitutional post? And how does the public trust a government packed with such tainted figures? In the latest instance of shamelessness, Nepali Congress has picked Badshah Kurmi, someone who is being investigated in a grave crime of the disappearance of a woman, as a minister in Lumbini province. This, just a month after protestors asking for justice signed a five-point deal with the erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, whereby the government promised to investigate Nirmala Kurmi’s mysterious 2010 disappearance and Badshah’s supposed hand in it. An earlier government committee formed to look into the matter had recommended that eight people, including Badshah, be apprehended and investigated in the case. The seven others were arrested, but not Badshah. Over in Gandaki province, Rajeev Gurung who is better known as Deepak Manange, a gangster who has been repeatedly jailed, is the minister for physical infrastructure, in what is his fourth stint as a provincial minister. On Saturday, a photo of Manange seated at his office chair in a vest went viral online. Reportedly, he had gathered his friends there, where they proceeded to drink till midnight. Likewise, Saroj Thapa, another person who is being investigated for human trafficking, has been made a minister in Lumbini province. Then, over in Bagmati province, Min Krishna Maharjan, a gun-loving thug, has been given the post of the minister for sports. The country’s two biggest political parties are now in power together, promising political stability and clean governance. Yet neither the Nepali Congress nor the CPN-UML seems much interested in controlling the criminalisation of politics. In fact, they are encouraging it. The two parties have nearly two-thirds majority in the federal lower house and hold the keys to all seven provincial governments as well. But even as their power grows, their sense of responsibility towards the society seems to be diminishing.Again, the country’s two biggest and best established political parties are openly promoting criminals and gangsters. Criminals of all persuasions in Nepal are known to join politics just to evade arrest. Not only do they ward off arrest, they even get lucrative positions. The country’s politics has become a pure numbers game, where getting to power is worth any cost. Our current prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, once said that criminals should get to shed their tainted past and serve the people by joining politics. He has over the years cultivated more than a handful of goons in his party. Oli’s current main partner-in-crime in the government, Sher Bahadur Deuba, has also over the years been tone-deaf to the criticism of his generosity towards politicians of baser characters. It is thanks to an attitude like this that people see the whole political class as a crime syndicate. Is the self-image of our mananiyas and ministers that of protectors and promoters of criminals, people wonder.  \nPolitical news from Nepal often feels like a glitch in the matrix: A repetitive play of events from 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. One could blindly pick newspapers from old archives, and the chances of events reading eerily similar to today’s political ‘developments’ are very high.Even politicians admit their abject failure to deliver, yet they are accountable to the same old ways. Voters are stuck between old parties that are different only in name and upstart smaller parties yet to prove their value. As Janan Ganesh put it in his brilliant article in the Financial Times, every country is seeing its own version of the “doom loop of modern politics.” There is a consensus that politicians are generally untrustworthy. Hence, people with strong competence or prospects in other fields avoid jumping into this muck for fear of sullying their names for uncertain outcomes. This leaves the field open to family members and princelings of the old guard—and others with fewer prospects elsewhere.With ‘professional’ politicians crowding this space, public service has become the first casualty. Governance has suffered, and groups with narrow individual interests disproportionately influence policy formulation. In an increasingly complex world where results are expected almost in real-time and with high frequency, failure to deliver feeds another cycle of cynicism among voters. This further discourages ‘good and competent’ people from jumping into the fray.Those entering Nepali politics, until now, have primarily been people who claim some sort of sacrifice made during democratic or republican movements. While this is not to belittle their hard work and sacrifice, it can no longer be the only criterion for seeking party positions or tickets. With internal democracy so weak among all parties, there is no scope for professionals from other fields to provide public service through politics. Our traditional political class is so scared of new entrants that they have erected many restrictive structures within the old parties, making it difficult for fresh joiners to succeed. This leads many to eventually quit or join others. Swarnim Wagle is one of many examples of how this restrictive political system plays out.This issue is equally prevalent in the civil service. Instead of opening up provisions for lateral hiring to infuse fresh talent, every effort is made to keep the bureaucracy incompetent and pliant. The traditional parties have not made any serious efforts to reform the bureaucracy, a topic that deserves a separate discussion.The only route available now is newer disruptive parties winning elections. The competition would help internal party politics as it would put pressure on choosing good candidates and may ultimately lead to party primaries that empower voters to choose who will be on the party ballot. This would help strengthen Nepali democracy.The recent uncharacteristic joining of hands by the Nepali Congress and the Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML)—equivalent to US Republicans and Democrats uniting—to form the government is largely a response to the pressure being felt by the old guards. When this experiment fails and voters punish one or both parties for ditching the fictitious ideological line, the party leadership will be forced to adopt more measures that could, by default, strengthen internal democracy. The hope is that this will create an enabling internal ecosystem within the old parties for young and comparatively more competent leaders to assert themselves. It is depressing to see that the young “Turks” who weren’t once afraid to challenge the monarch from the streets during royal rule have been forced to cower in silence, or worse, to defend the shenanigans of their party leadership.Silver liningNot everything is doom and gloom. The recent success of upstart parties like the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Janamat Party and the Nagarik Unmukti Party, as well as independent mayors like Balendra Shah, Harka Sampang and Gopal Hamal, is a testament to changing voting behaviour. There is much more willingness to break out of the mould and vote for hope. In traditional party strongholds, voters are voting in refreshing patterns. Even party cadres seem much more willing to vote against their candidates if they think those from rival parties would be better for their local area. Take, for instance, anecdotal evidence from Bharatpur and Damak mayoral vote counts in the last election. In Damak, out of the 10 wards, the UML won seven ward chair positions yet lost to the Rastriya Prajatantra Party in the mayoral election. The RPP only won one ward chair position. The story is similar in Bharatpur. The Maoists only won three ward chair positions out of 29, and in most of the wards, the party was not even a distant third in the vote tally, yet Renu Dahal won by a wide margin to be the mayor. Voters were clearly rewarding Renu for her delivery. Her father, being the prime minister, may have helped, but that is beside the point.We must encourage and support this disruption in politics. Political pundits should stop being cynical about the early lacklustre performance, occasional bad apples and missteps of the new parties barely two years into the process. Ultimately, Nepal needs much more direct democracy, not less, which means more choices for the voters. The old guards, who benefit from the current process that gives them a stranglehold over government formation and party selections, are making a last-ditch effort to maintain the status quo. It is a tragedy that traditional opinion makers and gatekeepers fail to recognise this misdirection and continue to be swayed by the knee-jerk reactions of the old guard.Political communication takes place very differently in this social media age. Mainstream media’s failure to reimagine its role only reinforces mistrust of institutions, feeding a frenzy within self-perpetuating social media echo chambers and further eroding trust in the democratic system. \nCompared to other countries in the world, Nepal is neither small nor devoid of the huge potential of being strong. Among the four state elements—sovereignty, territory, population and government—Nepal fares well in three but governance. Its strength lies in its capacity to endure overbearing upheavals that occasionally occur. Since the Anglo-Nepal War (1814-15), which led to the signing of the Sugauli Treaty, Nepal has not compromised its territory. This has been possible through timely, realistic foreign policy within the parameters of bilateral treaties with India and China. Such trends continue even today, despite the extension and diversification of policies. Popular movements have overthrown regimes ranging from Rana autocracy to monarchy; power has transferred smoothly from traditional monarchy to republic. The Nepali state thus remains unruffled by the general belief that monarchy and Nepal’s existence were coterminous or that one could not survive without the other. The Nepal Army, considered the mainstay of power and had served the Ranas and the Shahs, changed its status by supporting the new democratic republic. The Nepali state did not realise any threat to its existence during the 10-year-long Maoist insurgency or later in the wake of instabilities triggered by political parties. But it must be admitted that political parties have acted in unison while facing major political crises or defending the cause of democracy. They steadfastly proclaimed the republican constitution in 2015, resisting outside pressure to defer its announcement to make it more inclusive by addressing the demands of Madhesh parties. Nevertheless, a common feeling is that major political parties have failed to deliver on the minimum aspirations of the public as they are excessively indulged in petty personal and party interests. As a result, the governance crisis, fraught with dangers to other state elements, persists. Since sovereignty and fixed territory are the major elements, the Nepali state has a solid border stretching from the Mechi River in the east to the Mahakali River in the west, Tibet (China) to the north and India to the south (on three sides). Nepal has maintained a fixed boundary with its neighbours for over 200 years. It is highly unlikely that the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity will be jeopardised in the future because of geopolitical limitations that prevent us from being cavalier in handling foreign policy. Moreover, strategic autonomy, often used as a cliché in international relations, is a relative term employed only when allowed to do so in the given political context. All powers, big or small, strong or weak, have limitations and cannot always independently act as they want. The United States, China, Russia, or any other power cannot impose their respective decisions in the face of counter-actions to be undertaken by other hostile powers. For instance, the Russian invasion of Ukraine or China’s restraint on taking strong action against Taiwan, despite displaying aggressive postures, are some examples of limited autonomy of powers. Russia is badly entangled in its invasion of Ukraine, as the Western powers and a few others have not only condemned the Russian aggression but also taken countermeasures to foil its mission. The sovereignty of the state can be preserved only by relying more on prudent domestic and foreign policy, not on arming the state to the teeth. It is particularly so in Nepal’s context, whose very location does not allow it to be indifferent to the sensitivities of its neighbours, China and India. Such limitations have helped maintain Nepal’s long civilisational tradition and history of an independent sovereign nation-state. Fixed territory, recognition of independence and sovereignty buttressed by sound external policy are the country’s strengths. Recurring issues of minor territorial disputes with neighbours do not amount to the loss of settled international borders. Interestingly, in Jhapa, there are two places, Satighatta and Kechana Kawal, where Nepal’s border extends across the Mechi River, creating enclaves like those found in other countries. Surprisingly, no territorial disputes concerning these enclaves have arisen between Nepal and India, but the grudges of local Nepali citizens for being ignored by the state haunt the rulers. People who constitute an element of the state can be described according to the nature of the regime. In traditional monarchical regimes, as were prevalent in many countries of the world, people were/are treated as raiti or praja (subject), having no freedom of expression against the rulers. In such regimes, subject political culture prevails, thus forcing the people to be indoctrinated accordingly. Contrarily, in a democracy, people participate in the political process, which makes the government responsible for them. Popular legitimacy is, therefore, the essence of democratic governance. When such legitimate rights are denied, people revolt against the regimes, as happened in Nepal in 1990 and 2006. Legitimacy has different dimensions that transcend economic, political, social and international. It can be broadly called performance legitimacy, which is concerned with governability. If the system fails to cater to the minimum needs of the general public or fails to reduce socio-economic disparities, then the system begins to face mounting challenges that sometimes turn into rebellion. So, governance and legitimacy are inextricably linked. Today, liberal democracies or authoritarian regimes with limited pluralism seem to confront the crises of performance legitimacy and are increasingly becoming vulnerable to uncertain developments. Nepal’s social structure is solid, as the people live in peace and harmony amid socio-political degradation and despair. Social scientists prefer to call such a matrix as syncretic and synthetic. Religious bigotries are little known to Nepalis. Nevertheless, since the primacy of politics is well accepted, political parties have invariably failed to set an example by demonstrating their governability. Yet, Nepal’s exercises are not as alarming as many pundits tend to present. The country has been able to manage crises that creep into the body politic. The elected leaders are expected to be more sensible in consolidating the gains of the new democratic order. \nWe often hear about the importance of the human microbiome—the vast collection of bacteria and fungi that live on and inside us—when it comes to our health. But there’s another, equally important part of this microbial community that remains far less known: the virome.The virome consists of all the viruses that inhabit our bodies. This includes those that infect humans cells, bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and the viruses we aquire from our diet and environment. Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, with an estimated 10³¹ viral particles globally and about 10¹³ in each human being. For centuries, viruses have been seen mainly as causes of disease. But research suggests that viruses influence our health in important ways.Bacteriophages, for instance, play a crucial role in regulating the bacterial populations in our gut. By keeping harmful bacteria in check, they help prevent conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and obesity.Certain bacteriophages can also enhance the immune system’s ability to combat bacterial infections. They do this by breaking down the outer membranes of harmful bacteria—releasing antigens that stimulate immune responses.Some viruses that interact directly with our immune system even help maintain its balance—potentially protecting us from illnesses. For instance, herpesvirus, which causes cold sores and mononucleosis (mono), can alter immune responses. It does this in many ways—such as by promoting the production of specialised immune cells, altering the gene expression of cells and even suppressing anti-inflammatory responses. These changes may potentially reduce risk of developing secondary infections and allergic responses later in life.Conversely, some viruses might contribute to chronic inflammation by persistently activating immune pathways. The balance of these interactions is critical. A healthy virome helps fend off infections and support overall health. But an imbalanced virome may contribute to poor health and disease.Recent discoveriesThe field of virome research has advanced rapidly thanks to innovations in DNA sequencing. Techniques like shotgun sequencing allow scientists to analyse entire viral communities. This has revealed a wealth of previously unknown viruses and deepening our understanding of their roles in health and disease.Improved methods for isolating viral particles have also made it possible to analyse samples. Bioinformatics tools and databases, such as ViromeQC and the Gut Virome Database, may further support the identification and classification of viral sequences—making it easier to explore these complex communities.These innovations also mean researchers better understand the complexity of the virome and its role in human health.For example, research published earlier this year which tracked infants and their mothers found significant differences in their viromes. This indicates that an infant’s virome is shaped by factors such as diet and environment, rather than being inherited from the mother.Another study showed that newborns typically have no detectable virome at birth, but quickly acquire a diverse array of viruses, mainly bacteriophages, shortly after birth. These viruses are probably picked up from their environment, diet and the people they’re in close contact with.Alterations in the virome have been linked to various diseases, as well. For instance, changes in gut viral populations have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Patients with IBD often have higher levels of certain bacteriophages, suggesting these viruses may play a role in the disease’s development.Understanding the virome could revolutionise medicine and public health. One exciting possibility is phage therapy, where bacteriophages are used to target and destroy harmful bacteria. This approach could offer a powerful tool against antibiotic-resistant infections. Identifying specific virome changes could also lead to new diagnostic markers for diseases—possibly enabling earlier and more accurate interventions.The virome’s interaction with the immune system could hold promise for new vaccines and immune therapies, as well. By studying how certain viruses modulate immune responses, scientists could develop vaccines that better protect against infections.Personalised medicine could also benefit from virome research. Since each person’s virome is unique, treatments tailored to a person’s unique viral composition could enhance the effectiveness of therapies for a range of conditions, from gastrointestinal disorders to autoimmune diseases.The virome represents an exciting new frontier in our understanding of human health. As research continues to unveil the intricate interactions between viruses and their hosts, we can expect significant advances in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases.Read the original article here.-The Conversation \nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has won a third term with 51% of the vote, the country’s electoral authority said just after midnight on Monday, despite multiple exit polls which pointed to an opposition win.The authority said opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez won 44% of the vote, though the opposition had earlier said it had “reasons to celebrate” and asked supporters to continue monitoring vote counts.“The results cannot be hidden. The country has peacefully chosen a change,” Gonzalez said in a post on X at around 11 p.m. local time, before the results were announced.Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado reiterated a call for the country’s military to uphold the results of the vote.“A message for the military. The people of Venezuela have spoken: they don’t want Maduro,” she said earlier on X. “It is time to put yourselves on the right side of history. You have a chance and it’s now.”Venezuela’s military has always supported Maduro, a 61-year-old former bus driver and foreign minister, and there have been no public signs that leaders of the armed forces are breaking from the government.A poll from Edison Research, known for its polling of U.S. elections, had predicted in an exit poll that Gonzalez would win 65% of the vote, while Maduro would win 31%.Local firm Meganalisis predicted a 65% vote for Gonzalez and just under 14% for Maduro.About 80% of ballot boxes have been counted, said national electoral council (CNE) president Elvis Amoroso in a televised statement, adding results had been delayed because of an “aggression” against the electoral data transmission system. \nIsrael’s security cabinet on Sunday authorised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to decide on the “manner and timing” of a response to a rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 teenagers and children, and which Israel and the United States blamed on Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.Hezbollah denied responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams on Saturday, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since Palestinian militant group Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault sparked the war in Gaza. That conflict has spread to several fronts and risks spilling into a wider regional conflict.Israel has vowed retaliation against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Israeli jets hit targets in southern Lebanon during the day on Sunday.But there were expectations a stronger response could follow the security cabinet meeting convened by Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.After the meeting ended, Netanyahu’s office said the cabinet “authorized the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister to decide on the manner and timing of the response.”The White House on Sunday also blamed Hezbollah for the Majdal Shams strike. “This attack was conducted by Lebanese Hezbollah. It was their rocket, and launched from an area they control,” it said in a statement. US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said through her national security adviser that her “support for Israel’s security is ironclad,”The US said Washington has been in discussions with Israeli and Lebanese counterparts since Saturday’s “horrific” attack and that it was working on a diplomatic solution. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington did not want further escalation of the conflict, which has seen daily exchanges of fire between the Israeli military and Hezbollah along the border.Britain expressed concern at further escalation while Egypt said the attack could spill “into a comprehensive regional war.”On the ground, thousands of people gathered for funerals in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.Members of the Druze faith, which is related to Islam, Christianity and Judaism, make up more than half the 40,000-strong population of the Golan Heights. Large crowds of mourners, many in traditional high white and red Druze headwear, surrounded the caskets as they were carried through the village.“A heavy tragedy, a dark day has come to Majdal Shams,” said Dolan Abu Saleh, head of the Majdal Shams local council, in comments broadcast on Israeli television.Hezbollah initially announced it fired rockets at Israeli military sites in the Golan Heights, but said it had “absolutely nothing” to do with the attack on Majdal Shams.Israel says rocket Iranian-madeHowever, Israel said the rocket was an Iranian-made missile fired from an area north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon, placing the blame squarely on Iranian-backed Hezbollah.It was not immediately clear if the children and teenagers killed were Israeli citizens.“The rocket that murdered our boys and girls was an Iranian rocket and Hezbollah is the only terror organization which has those in its arsenal,” Israel’s foreign ministry said.Two security sources told Reuters that Hezbollah was on high alert and had cleared some key sites in both Lebanon’s south and the eastern Bekaa Valley in case of an Israeli attack.Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines said it was delaying the arrival of some flights from Sunday night to Monday morning, without stating why.Israeli forces have been exchanging fire for months with Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon, but both sides have appeared to be avoiding an escalation that could lead to all-out war, potentially dragging in other powers including the United States and Iran.However, Saturday’s strike threatened to tip the standoff into a more dangerous phase. United Nations officials urged maximum restraint from both sides, warning that escalation could “engulf the entire region in a catastrophe beyond belief.”Lebanon has asked the U.S to urge restraint by Israel, Lebanon’s foreign minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, told Reuters. Bou Habib said the US had asked Lebanon’s government to pass on a message to Hezbollah to show restraint as well.All-out war fearedIran’s foreign ministry warned Israel on Sunday against what it called any new adventure in Lebanon.Syria’s foreign ministry said it held Israel “fully responsible for this dangerous escalation in the region” and said its accusations against Hezbollah were false.The conflict has forced tens of thousands of people in both Lebanon and Israel to leave their homes. Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists.Hezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East and opened a second front against Israel shortly after Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on Israel.Druze communities live on both sides of the line between southern Lebanon and northern Israel as well as in the Golan Heights and Syria. While some serve in the Israeli military and identify with Israel, many feel marginalized in Israel and some also reject Israeli citizenship. \nOn Monday, the weather will be partly to generally cloudy across the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is expected in a few areas of Madhesh Province and in some parts of the remaining provinces, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Tonight, the country will be generally cloudy. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely in various locations. There is a chance of heavy rainfall in a few areas of Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki, with heavy to very heavy rainfall possible in one or two places in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki.Currently, the entire country is under the influence of monsoon winds, with the monsoon trough positioned near its average location.On Sunday, the maximum temperature was 36.9°C in Bhairahawa, and the minimum temperature was 15°C in Jomsom. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli took a briefing from secretaries of all the ministries on Sunday. After being appointed the prime minister on July 15, Oli convened his first meeting with the secretaries to learn about their ministries, in the presence of ministers.Officials from the National Planning Commission and heads of the security agencies also attended the meeting.The secretaries updated Oli on the situation and functioning of their respective ministries, said Pradip Yadav, the minister for water supply and sanitation.“Every secretary spoke for around 10 to 15 minutes, informing the prime minister about the problems facing the ministries and their future plans,” Yadav told the Post. “The secretaries of developmental ministries [such as the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport] stressed the need for sufficient budget and difficulties in the procurement process while some called for bringing laws up to date with the constitution.”The secretaries complained about the cumbersome procurement process. The agriculture secretary raised the problem of chemical fertilisers, Minister Yadav said.The two secretaries who participated in the discussion with the prime minister told the Post, requesting anonymity, that they now await a set of instructions from the prime minister.They, however, added that there is no dearth of such instructions from the head of government. “What the bureaucracy needs instead is confidence and favourable work conditions,” a secretary told the Post on the condition of anonymity.“There is a situation in which our friends [civil servants] have to face corruption cases just for working as instructed by the ministers,” the secretaries told the Post. “There is no such ministry at present to which the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has not issued a letter of inquiry.”The government mostly fails to provide chemical fertilisers to farmers when they need it for paddy plantation. The agriculture secretary said that the ministry had failed to supply the farm inputs due to procurement hassles.The secretary at the water supply ministry, headed by Yadav, drew the prime minister’s attention to the fast depleting aquifer as an impact of climate change. “Underground water has dried up in many parts of Madhesh Province and the people there are facing a lack of drinking water,” Yadav said. Minister Yadav said that after studying the secretaries’ statements, the prime minister will issue instructions on Tuesday. Then, the government will plan the work for the current fiscal year accordingly.All the ministers, except for Minister for Information and Communication Prithvi Subba Gurung and Minister for Youths and Sports Tejulal Chaudhary, were present during the briefing. Chaudhary has gone to France for the Olympic ceremony while Gurung had another event to attend. \nThe juvenile correction centres in the country have failed to serve their purposes, study reports say.Presenting their reports to the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives on Sunday, three sub-panels stated that the juvenile correction centres are overcrowded, they lack basic amenities and have safety issues. The three subcommittees of the House were deployed to Koshi, Madhesh and Lumbini provinces to study the juvenile correction centres, along with prisons, there.After studying three out of nine correction centres, all the parliamentary subcommittees had similar findings that they lack facilities even for education, health, hygiene, rest, sports and psychological counselling. Similarly, they host inmates more than four times their capacity.Against its capacity for 50 inmates, the juvenile correction centre in Biratnagar has 222. Similarly, 117 inmates have been crammed into the lBirgunj-based correction centre while it has the capacity for just 17. In Banke, 240 juvenile delinquents are housed in a centre with the maximum holding capacity for 190.\"The situation of the child correction centres is worrisome. They cannot be called correction centres,\" said Gopa Labh Sapkota, who led the study team for Birgunj.The House committee decided to carry out on-site inspection of the correction centres following one after another incident of violence there.On July 9, at least 60 inmates fled the Jayandu Juvenile Correction Centre in Duduwa Rural Municipality of Banke district following a violent clash among themselves. The police managed to capture all but two absconders who are believed to have crossed over to India.That was the third incident of violence in the correction centre within a year. One minor lost his life while 11 others were injured after clashes among the inmates in September last year. In another incident, a few inmates were injured following violent fights in August. As many as 275 juvenile delinquents are housed there.On August 21 last year, 297 juvenile inmates at the Underprivileged Children’s Educational Programmes in Bhaktapur clashed with security personnel, leaving 20 police officials and 15 juvenile inmates injured. The juvenile delinquents clashed with the police after one of the minors died under mysterious circumstances.They not only clashed with the Nepal Police and Armed Police Force personnel but as many as 221 fled the centre, breaching its gate and compound wall. Three weeks later, on September 12, inmates from a juvenile centre in Birta of Birgunj Metropolitan City clashed among themselves.A group of inmates transferred from the juvenile centre in Sanothimi, Bhaktapur had physically assaulted their leader. Some minors from Bhaktapur were transferred to Birgunj after the clash that injured 20 security personnel and 15 juvenile inmates.Juvenile centres house children below 18 years who are convicted or are kept in custody for their involvement in crimes.Appearing before the House committee on Sunday, Ramesh Lekhak, the minister for home affairs, said the government was well aware of the problems in the juvenile correction centres. \"We will pay proper attention to improve the situation,\" he said.A juvenile delinquent is a person under the age of 18 who commits an act that otherwise would have been charged as a crime if s/he was an adult. The minors, who commit a crime punishable by law, are kept in correction homes instead of being sent to a jail after court verdict, as per the existing law.Those who cross 18 years of age before completing their jail terms too are kept in correction homes with the minors until they serve the set term. The study reports have blamed the inmates who are above 18 for the violence. Over two thirds of the inmates in the centres have crossed the 18 years of age. Those stepping into adulthood were found to have been involved in attacking their juniors, said the report from Banke. The country has eight juvenile correction centres—in Bhaktapur, Morang, Kaski, Makwanpur, Parsa, Rupandehi, Banke and Doti.

This is because the industry is beset by deep-rooted corruption and mismanagement as the country builds airports worth billions of rupees but fails to attract flights. Improving safety remains a far cry.On different occasions, global aviation watchdogs have voiced serious concerns about the capability of Nepal’s civil aviation authority to oversee safety issues.In the past year and a half, more than 100 people have lost their lives in plane crashes—despite air travel being the world’s safest and most regulated industry in the world. Wednesday’s crash is the seventh under Pradip Adhikari, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal who fits into all political systems, and the fourth fatal one of his tenure.Here are a few examples of how policy corruption has paralysed the Nepali aviation industry, the lifeline of the country’s tourism industry and transport in the mountain region. A few years back, a parliamentary sub-committee headed by Madhav Kumar Nepal had ordered the government to immediately split the civil aviation body due to its dual role of doing business and regulating the sector. Nepal, the CPN (Unified Socialist) leader, sent Prem Ale to head the tourism ministry a few months later. Ale stopped the bills from being tabled in the lower house for discussion, although the upper house had passed them.Then, Jeevan Ram Shrestha was appointed tourism minister. On his first day, he announced that he would wait to meet the European Commission’s request to separate Nepal’s civil aviation into regulatory and service-providing organisations.After that, Sudan Kirati was picked as the tourism minister by the Maoist Centre. He took the initiative to register the civil aviation bills in Parliament.Kirati had accused Director General Adhikari of consistently failing to ensure aviation safety, as five aircraft incidents and accidents, including three major disasters, have occurred under Adhikari’s watch.Sources said then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal summoned Kirati and Adhikari and ordered them to work “in tandem”. Kirati then stopped talking about the separation.The issue was then taken up by the parliamentary International Relations and Tourism Committee, which directed Dahal, then prime minister, to table the civil aviation bills in the House of Representatives as soon as possible. The directive was issued in December last year. “The bills have been languishing for a long time. As we doubt the civil aviation ministry will table them in Parliament, we have directed the Prime Minister's Office to do so,” Raj Kishore Yadav, chairman of the committee, had told the Post. A few months later, when the Post approached Yadav to inquire about any progress on the bills, Yadav replied that a split “was not necessary”. The budget for this fiscal year, too, makes no mention of the plan to split the aviation body, after including it in the federal government’s document for three consecutive years.In April, lawmaker and member of the International Relations and Tourism Committee Udaya Shumsher Rana told an interaction that he was informed by a former tourism minister that there is an “invisible” hand preventing the passage of two crucial civil aviation bills. In August 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the United Nations aviation watchdog, formally asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body and ensure a proper regulatory system. However, the Civil Aviation Authority chose to keep the report secret.A former director general said the tourism industry is bearing the repercussions as planes come down each passing year due to a lax regulatory system. “People are dying due to ‘policy corruption.’”On a sunny Wednesday, nineteen people, including two crew members, were on the Saurya Airlines flight to Pokhara. The 50-seater bombardier CRJ 200 with registration mark 9N-AME was flying 15 technicians to the city, where the jet’s heavy maintenance C-check was planned. At 11:11 am, the plane took off from the runway’s southern end (Koteshwar). But just a few seconds after the takeoff, people around the airport heard a loud “bang”. “That was an unusual sound. It was a big bang like a bomb [exploding],” said a top official of a private airline, who was a close witness to the crash.Video footage obtained by the Post shows that the jet rolled and climbed around 80-90ft from the ground. It then tilted towards the right and instantly came down. It hit the ground and burst into flames.The plane then rolled down into a ravine.The cockpit slammed into a cargo container, and it was stuck there, which observers say saved the pilot-in-command, Manish Ratna Shakya, the chief of the operation department at Saurya Airlines.“The pilot survived. He is in stable condition,” said DIG Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for Nepal Police. “It was a miracle.”The fuselage came apart, hit the slope of the tabletop airport, and ricocheted 50 metres away, finally coming to rest on the muddy ground.Eighteen people, including the co-pilot and a foreigner, died. The cockpit and tail were intact.The 21.4-year-old aircraft was inducted into the Saurya Airlines fleet on March 14, 2017.CCTV footage shows that the nature of the crash was similar to last January’s Yeti Airlines crash in Pokhara.Experts suspect many factors, including an engine failure, a bird strike, and poor maintenance.“The investigation will tell the truth,” said Subash Jha, spokesman for Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. This is the second biggest crash inside the Kathmandu airport after the US Bangla, a Dhaka-based airline, accident in March 2018 killed 52 of the 71 passengers aboard. Experts observing the crash closely say that, given the nature of the plane’s fall, the right engine might have stopped working and the aircraft eventually lost the “control panel” mode. This narrow panel, located centrally in front of the pilot, can be used to control heading, speed, altitude, vertical speed, vertical navigation, and lateral navigation.“The aircraft has banked,” said an aircraft engineer. A banked turn (or banking turn) is a turn or change of direction in which the aircraft banks or inclines, usually towards the inside of the turn.“Had it been the left engine, it could have potentially crashed into at least two big planes parked at the tarmac of the airport and the domestic terminal. The impact was huge. The plane just exploded.”One official at the safety department of the civil aviation body suspected a potential bird strike. “What happens when a bird enters an aircraft engine? If an aircraft engine ingests a bird, it can result in engine failure.”“In such a case, if the pilot failed to judge and identify which of the two engines is the problematic one, it could lead to such a situation.”But a senior airline executive countered the argument.“The aircraft has two engines. Even if one engine fails, it would be difficult to climb, but only if it has a full load. The 50-seater plane was carrying just 17 people, a third of its capacity. I don’t believe a bird strike downed the plane.”He, however, suspects poor maintenance. On Wednesday, the plane had taken off after 30 days on the ground.In many cases, a plane stored for several weeks or months could encounter problems if it is flown without a proper inspection. Saurya does not have a hangar in Kathmandu.A civil aviation body official confirmed that the 9N-AME had been on the ground for 30 days.“The engine exploded. Given the nature of the explosion, foreign object damage (FOD) to an aircraft engine can be suspected. FOD happens when a foreign object impacts the engine. Since there are no proper hangers for the storage of its planes in Kathmandu, FOD cannot be ruled out,” said the expert, dismissing the bird strike theory.A senior air safety specialist, who wished not to be named because the investigation is ongoing, said both events—a bird strike and FOD—cannot be ruled out.“Only the flying captain, the lone survivor, and the black box can tell us what exactly happened,” said the air safety specialist. “However, to stop unnecessary rumours, the investigation team should record the captain’s statement and release a preliminary report immediately.”Aviation analyst Hemant Arjyal wrote on the social media platform X: “We do not know what actually happened in today’s crash, but engine seems to be the culprit. And technically, IF a multi-engine aircraft suffers an engine failure during the takeoff roll, THE AIRCRAFT WILL YAW TOWARDS THE FAILED ENGINE.”The airline company has been in a financial crisis for several years. Its financial health deteriorated especially after the Covid pandemic.Last year, it submitted a plan to the civil aviation body to switch to ATR-72-type aircraft and promised to maintain safety standards of the existing fleet until it imported the ATR planes. However, airline officials say they could not secure investment to replace their fleet.However, the civil aviation body overlooked the airline’s financial condition, which is obviously a major safety concern.“With Nepal’s key festival just over two months away, Saurya, which had a total of three aircraft, was planning a full maintenance of the Bombardier that crashed on Wednesday to remain afloat. The Bombardier CRJ200 had 200 engine hours left for full maintenance,” according to insiders. Full maintenance alone does not necessarily ensure full safety of flights.Now the airline is left with just one airworthy plane, and authorities are unlikely to allow the company to operate for the same reason. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli paid a rare visit to the crash site on Wednesday.Saurya Airlines had also laid off staff due to financial problems last year. Despite several attempts, the airline officials could not be reached for comments.According to insiders, poor aircraft maintenance could be one of the potential crash factors, as keeping planes airworthy is costly.Engineers who wrote “fit to fly” too died in the crash.Yet in the immediate aftermath of the crash, there is also a lot of confusion.Another aviation expert ruled out the possibility of poor maintenance. “The entire maintenance team was on the plane. Why would they be on a suicide mission if the plane was ill-maintained?”However, the crash has shed light on different aspects of regulatory failure.It was later found that among the entire maintenance team, two passengers [one child and a woman], the son and wife of a Saurya technician, were flown in the plane cleared for maintenance, which is against the rule.“This suggests the regulator’s negligence,” said Sanjiv Gautam, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. “How can the regulator allow passengers on the ferry flight? That’s sheer negligence.”A ferry flight involves flying an aircraft from one location to another without passengers or cargo, typically for maintenance purposes.Aviation in Nepal is beset with deep-set corruption and mismanagement.The frequent crashes have deterred foreign tourists. Especially high-end tourists have been avoiding travel outside Kathmandu by air because they worry about safety, according to tour operators.Global aviation watchdogs have questioned the civil aviation body’s dual role and urged Nepal to split the organisation into two entities—service provider and regulator—to enhance the safety of flyers.However, successive governments have not shown much interest, although they have spent over Rs 500 million on drafting the civil aviation bills.Following the September 2012 crash of Sita Air Flight 601 in the Manohara river, which killed 19 people, including seven British citizens, the European Commission imposed a blanket ban on Nepali airlines from flying into the 27-nation bloc in December 2013.It’s been 11 years, and the ban has not been lifted as Nepal has failed to address safety deficiencies.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, nearly 950 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955. And just in a year and a half, more than 100 people have perished in air crashes, indicating higher casualties as bigger aircraft are involved in recent accidents.In January 2023, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed in Pokhara, killing all 72 people on board, in the third biggest air accident in terms of casualties. The crash happened two weeks after the inauguration of the China-funded airport.The first big air accident in Nepal happened on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near the Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Before that, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.The government on Wednesday formed a five-member commission headed by Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, former director general of Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, to investigate the crash. \nSeven Nepali athletes will compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics in different events with the goal of securing an official Olympic medal for Nepal.\nNepal's new Cabinet under KP Sharma Oli shows a severe underrepresentation of women (only 9% representation) and Dalits, despite the country's over 50% female population and legal mandates for women's representation.\nDistrict hospitals lack family planning programs due to budget cuts, raising concerns of increased unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and higher maternal and child mortality rates.\nJSP-Nepal and CPN (Unified Socialist) concluded their conventions without fully completing the election process, delaying the appointment of key party officials and central committee members.\nNepalese leader rose to power on a nationalist platform, including territorial disputes with India and a strong anti-India stance.\nIn an interview, Pyakuryal, a PhD holder in Public Affairs, analyzes Nepal's political instability, prevailing narratives, patriarchy's influence, and upcoming trends in Nepali politics.\n\n\nVajra Books and Publications has published the English translation and scientific analysis of the Muluki Ain, first drafted by Janga Bahadur Rana in 1854. This text, a major milestone for the archiving of Nepali historical documents, was translated by Rajan Khatiwoda, Simon Cubelic, and Axel Michaels, a team created in collaboration with Heidelberg University.The first Muluki Ain was considered an important document not only in Nepali but also in South Asian history. It was created to replace sporadic regional law systems of various parts of the country and unify them through a single legal system. Although the text is traditionally accredited to Janga Bahadur Rana, a fact our authors also acknowledge in this translation piece, it was most possibly drafted by a council of prominent lawmakers.The team behind this translated piece is especially dedicated to South Asian legal history. Khatiwoda completed his PhD on the Homicidal Law of 19th-century Nepal, based on various versions of the Muluki Ain. Cubelic, with his PhD in Hindu Legal Scriptures (Dharmashastra), and Michaels, a senior professor at Heidelberg University focusing on South Asian text culture and language, are also experts in this field.The translation brings the various legislatures of 19th-century Nepal to the eye of a larger readership. Some highlights of the Muluki Ain are its highlighting of laws around caste and family systems, purity and sexuality, and punishment systems. These punishment systems also include penalties for acts ranging from stealing, murder and other crimes, to smaller grievances, like punishments for spitting and farting. The text acts as a time capsule for enthusiasts of early Rana history.The authors believe that their text was primarily created to make Nepal’s first written law more accessible to scholars, local and Global, especially those interested in the legal and political systems of South Asia. Khatiwoda adds, “We believe that the book will assist scholars, researchers, and those with interest in related materials to comprehend the immediate social, economic, and political environment of South Asia and Nepal.”Although initially published by Heidelberg University, Vajra Publications has now released the book to make it easily accessible to Nepalese and South Asian audiences. \nAlthough Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) relieved its founding general secretary and spokesperson Mukul Dhakal of all his responsibilities, the party leaders are struggling to pick the new general secretary and spokesperson.The party's central committee meeting, held on July 9, decided to expel Dhakal from all official posts. However, the central committee retained him as a general member considering his contribution to the party since its inception.Leaders said the party took action against him on the recommendation of the disciplinary commission that Dhakal had breached party rules and discipline.Dhakal was punished after he made public his review report that stated the RSP’s popularity had nosedived and that it may face a disaster soon. In the report he submitted to party chief Rabi Lamichhane in June last week, he charged the party leaders with failing to fulfil the promises they made with the general people through Parliament and the government. RSP leaders accused him of making the content of the report public through the media.He prepared the report after touring 38 districts, which the party had assigned in the wake of the Ilam byelections held in April.According to party insiders, some key leaders are in the race for the positions of general secretary and party spokesperson. Top leaders are lobbying to promote the leaders close to them to the major positions. “The way the leaders are engaged in an intense competition within the party for the roles, the issue is unlikely to be resolved soon,” said a leader. “This shows the party might not get a new general secretary and spokesperson immediately.”The party leaders, however, said that while relieving Dhakal from the official position, the party had given him 35 days to respond. With the time yet to pass, the party cannot appoint its general secretary and spokesperson, claimed the leaders.“The party gave Dhakal 35 days to counter its decision,” Manish Jha, the acting spokesperson and RSP lawmaker, told the Post. “It would be unfair to Dhakal if the party appoints new officer bearers before the given time.”But a lawmaker of the party requesting anonymity said that the 35-day timeline was just a technical issue. According to him, the leaders are intensely lobbying for promoting leaders close to them to the twin positions, causing delays.“There are few chances that the party will appoint a new general secretary and spokesperson in the near future,” the RSP lawmaker told the Post. “The party may not be able to appoint anyone to those positions for some time even after the 35-day deadline.”On July 3, following suggestions from the party's disciplinary commission, the RSP central committee suspended Dhakal from the position of general secretary and spokesperson. On the same day, the party also picked Deputy General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti as acting general secretary and Joint Spokesperson Manish Jha as acting spokesperson.Meanwhile, as the party left the government earlier this month, it plans to run some campaigns.A leader says the party leadership intends to hold a closed camp of party members in the near future to rejuvenate party activities.“After getting unseated from the government, our party is currently in a warm-up for the upcoming activities,” Hari Dhakal, a RSP lawmaker, told the Post. “Our party will possibly hold the national conference soon after the closed camp.”As multiple leaders including party chief Lamichhane and deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar, who was also nominated lawmaker from the same party, face various allegations, leaders have raised voices for intra-party investigations.Lamichhane has been accused of being involved in embezzling millions of rupees deposited by common people at multiple cooperatives. A parliamentary special committee is investigating the scam.Deputy Speaker Rana has landed in controversy after a letter written by her requesting the US embassy for interview dates was leaked. She has been blamed for corresponding with a diplomatic agency bypassing Parliament Secretariat and the foreign ministry—that too for individuals not related to the parliament.“The party is forming a panel under the discipline committee to review all allegations against the party,” lawmaker Dhakal told the Post. “It is as per the decision of the central committee meeting on July 25 and not because anyone raised the issue.”Apart from this, the party has also decided to form an 11-member statute amendment recommendation led by the party's acting general secretary, Burlakoti, and to form a panel under the discipline committee to review all allegations against the party, lawmaker Dhakal said.Leaders said they are also planning to organise some demonstrations to mount pressure on the government.Acting general secretary Burlakoti said his party had tried to draw the attention of the prime minister and finance minister to the sluggish development of various infrastructure projects even in the past as well.“Our party President and Vice President held a meeting with the prime minister thrice to urge him to give necessary attention to those projects,” Burlakoti told the Post. “Our party also tried to allocate a sufficient budget for these projects.”Burlakoti claimed that the government fell before the implementation of the budget, so they were unable to provide any tangible result to the public. \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has once again defended Deputy Speaker Indira Rana, who has landed in a controversy over requesting in writing the US Embassy for visa interview dates.The party has accused the ruling parties of trying to scandalise the “trivial” issue with a malafide intention to unseat her.A central committee meeting of the RSP on Thursday concluded that the coalition of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress, which is in minority in the Constitutional Council, wanted to remove Rana and get a lawmaker from their parties to replace her. Besides the roles in the legislature, the Deputy Speaker is also a member of the Council that elects chiefs and members of constitutional bodies and the chief justice.The chief justice, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly chair, the leader of the main opposition in the House and the Deputy Speaker are members of the Constitutional Council, which is headed by the prime minister. The UML, which now leads the coalition government involving the Congress and some fringe parties, has two seats in the Constitutional Council. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and House Speaker Devraj Ghimire are from the second-largest party. (Though a Speaker resigns from all party positions after being appointed to lead the House, s/he hardly is aloof from their party in practice as they mostly rejoin it after the completion of the tenure). The CPN (Maoist Centre) is as strong as the UML in the council. Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as the leader of the opposition, and National Assembly chair Narayan Prasad Dahal are members of the Council.If Deputy Speaker Rana resigns, then the ruling coalition can appoint a lawmaker from one of its components in her position and secure a majority in the Council, even if the chief justice stays neutral in constitutional appointments, RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha said. That the ruling parties had blown the issue out of proportion 18 months after the letter addressed to the embassy made it clear that it was politically motivated, he claimed. Deputy Speaker Rana on February 26 last year wrote a letter to the US Embassy, requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. She faces pressure to quit, after the letter was leaked recently.She requested the embassy to arrange interview dates for six people, including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar, and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter. Rana had written that she wanted the interview dates to be preponed as they were attending the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, scheduled to be held in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023. Experts and retired parliamentary officials criticised her for corresponding with diplomatic agencies without informing the Parliament Secretariat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.After the central committee meeting on Thursday, RSP officials tried to downplay the issue saying that their inquiry had found that the letter hadn’t been registered at the US Embassy in Kathmandu.“The letter has not been registered at the embassy. Nor do we have the evidence of any financial dealings,” said Jha.On July 21, RSP lawmaker Sumana Shrestha, defending Rana in Parliament, said that a media trial was underway to assassinate the character of the Deputy Speaker. Shrestha had said they were ready to leave the post if the ruling parties asked for it. “If you need a seat on the Constitutional Council, ask for it. But a woman’s character should not be assassinated in this manner,” Shrestha had said. After the central committee meeting on Thursday, Jha said allegations against Deputy Speaker Rana were discussed in the central committee.“We challenge the other parties to prove that the letter was registered at the Embassy,” Jha told the Post. “During our informal investigation, we found that no recommendation letter by Rana was registered at the US Embassy.” He added that the letter was dated 18 months ago, and no one was found to have taken any benefits from the recommendation. Her intentions were not wrong, Jha said.Since the deputy Speaker is no longer a member of the party, RSP was not in a position to make any organisational decision related to her, he added.“Complaints against her have been filed to the Parliament Secretariat and the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the legislature. Our party will form an opinion if needed based on the decision they make.” The party meeting also reached a decision to form a panel under the discipline committee to review all allegations the party faces. The meeting decided to form an 11-member statute amendment recommendation committee led by acting RSP General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti. \nThe ruling and opposition parties have started a blame game over Deputy Speaker Indira Rana's move to write a letter to the American Embassy in Kathmandu to allocate convenient visa interview dates for individuals without clear statuses.While some ruling party lawmakers demanded a probe into the matter, opposition lawmakers including those from the Rastriya Swatantra Party said it was a non issue.During the special time in the House of Representatives on Sunday, Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada demanded a committee to probe the correspondence by Rana.\"A letter requesting dates for US visas has been received. Can the Deputy Speaker still command Parliament?\" he asked. \"There is the Parliament Secretariat to facilitate the visa process if anyone of Parliament has to travel abroad. The Deputy Speaker has breached the norm by writing the letter herself.\"He claimed Rana's move had brought shame not just to Parliament but the whole country. \"The Deputy Speaker's Office cannot act as a consultancy to facilitate the visa process,\" he said.On February 26, 2023 she had written to the consular general at the Embassy of the United States in Kathmandu to arrange interview dates for six people including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter.Rana wrote that as they were attending the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York on March 6 to 17, 2023, she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. She is now being criticised for misusing her position to make undiplomatic requests.Deputy Speaker, a constitutional position, is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council that recommends chiefs and members of constitutional bodies and the chief justice.Opposition lawmakers, however, claimed that the issue was blown out of proportion because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. Sumana Shrestha, a Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) lawmaker, said Rana's character was being assassinated because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. The council has two members each from the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), one from the RSP and the next is the chief justice.\"Ask for [Rana's] support, we can give. But can you ruin the character of someone by calling them a human trafficker [because the ruling alliance is in a minority]?\" she asked. \"Character assisination is unacceptable. Let us check how everyone has used their letterheads in the past.”She said there must be the criteria for using the letter. She accused the major parties of resorting to a media trial of the deputy Speaker.Stating that the world knows how a lawmaker behaved in Parliament and on the streets demanding visa for an individual, she said the current criticism was nothing but a planned move against Rana. Gyan Bahadur Shahi, a Rastriya Prajatantra Party lawmaker, had led a mass protest against the US Embassy for denying visa to cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane.Though there can be moral questions for writing the letter, Madhav Sapkota, a CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker, said, the way the letter was brought to the public domain now gives enough room to suspect the motive.\"We condemn the move if it is being done with an aim to bulldoze decisions from the Constitutional Council,\" he said. \"As an opposition party, we will strongly oppose such moves.\" Rana also claims that there have been coordinated attempts to attack her. Issuing a statement on Friday, she said, “The attempt to scandalise the letter I wrote out of compassion, after a year and a half, is nothing but a move orchestrated against me,” reads the letter.“Those who know me well are aware of my nature. I may have many personal shortcomings, and there may be many who try to take advantage of that, but I have never engaged in unethical actions, nor will I ever do.\" Experts in the field say the issue is not as light as Rana is trying to portray.Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, said the deputy Speaker must be held accountable for her act.It would be hasty to conclude that writing the letter was an act of human trafficking, Thapa told the Post. “But it is clearly a misuse of authority.\"Rana must take responsibility for her wrongdoings, he said. Writing for herself was not a problem but including the names of those who are not related to Parliament in any way is problematic, Thapa argued.An official at the secretariat claimed that Rana had tried to get the secretariat to write the letter. That didn't happen as then-general secretary Bharat Raj Gautam didn't agree to it, said the official. \"She wrote the letter herself as the general secretary refused to involve the parliament secretariat in it.\" \nThe constitutional bench of the Supreme Court will hear a writ petition challenging the appointment of CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli as prime minister.A single bench of Justice Bal Krishna Dhakal on Sunday forwarded the case to the constitutional bench, citing the need for a ‘serious constitutional interpretation’.“The matter raised in the writ petition involves serious questions of constitutional interpretation, and its resolution should be done by the constitutional bench. Therefore, present it before the chief justice,” the order states.Advocates Deepak Adhikari, Khagendra Prasad Chapagain and Shailendra Kumar Gupta filed the petition on July 15, seeking a mandamus order to annul the appointment arguing that it was unconstitutional.The petitioners argue that the President should initiate the new government formation under Article 76(3) if a government formed under Article 76(2) fails to secure a vote of confidence.Article 76(2) states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the House, the President appoints as prime minister “a member of the House who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties.”Article 76(3) allows the President to appoint the parliamentary party leader of the largest party as prime minister, subjecting him to a vote of confidence within 30 days. Under the clause, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba would become prime minister as the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House.The Office of the President, the Federal Parliament Secretariat, Nepali Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli, among others, have been named defendants in the petition.President Ramchandra Paudel on July 15 appointed Oli as the prime minister after he staked his claim to the post with the support of 166 lawmakers.The President had made a call as per Article 76(2) of the constitution after Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was appointed under the same article, failed the floor test. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nWomen travellers love staying longer in Gandaki Province, which hosts Pokhara, the world-famous Annapurna Circuit, the ancient forbidden kingdom of Mustang, and the gorgeous Manang village, to name a few tourist attractions, compared to men, it has been found. A special report on the trend of staying and spending of foreign tourists in Gandaki, published by the research unit of the Nepal Rastra Bank’s Pokhara office, shows that female tourists spend an average of 13 days in the province, while male visitors spend 11 days.Mani Raj Lamichhane, director of the Research, Planning, and Monitoring Department of the Nepal Tourism Board, said many factors draw female travellers to Gandaki, and the kinds of activities they engage in make their stay longer than men’s.The trekking routes of Annapurna base camp are a huge draw nowadays, especially for female adventure seekers, Lamichhane added. This destination is affordable, safe, short and easy.There are many tour and hotel operators led by women in Pokhara, which provides a “sense of safety and security” for women trekkers who nowadays go on long treks and enjoy Lake City.In March, Pokhara, a picturesque city nestled in the lap of the Annapurna mountain range, was officially declared Nepal’s tourism capital.Businesses such as discos, nightclubs, and live music venues in Pokhara operate 24/7, providing extended opportunities for entertainment and leisure.Pokhara now has an international airport but has yet to begin commercial operations.While the average number of days tourists spend in Nepal is 13.2, those coming to this part of western Nepal spend an average of 12 days, according to the survey.According to the report, tourists on travel packages spend $89.31 a day, while free independent travellers (FITs) pay $54.32 a day.The average spending of tourists in Gandaki is $62.89 a day.The report said that 76 percent of the visitors to Gandaki are FITs.Most of the spending is on food.Visitors spend 28.22 percent on food, 27.6 percent on accommodation, 21.7 percent on transportation, and 12.3 percent on entertainment.The central bank’s regional office surveyed six of the 11 districts in the province, covering 400 tourists.Age-wise, the average staying period of tourists between 31 and 45 is high, as they spend 14 days in the province.Among the six districts surveyed, Manang has one of the longest stays of 18 days. The shortest stay is in Gorkha district, that is four days.Most tourists described their stay in the province as positive, with 60 percent saying “highly positive” and 34.75 responding “positive”. The survey result showed that tourists had a good experience visiting the province.The survey said 23.11 percent faced problems related to transportation, while 15.34 percent faced payment hassles during travel.Similarly, 12.31 percent of tourists faced language problems, and 6.44 percent needed more tour information.According to the report, 53.12 percent of tourists bought tour packages from a Nepali travel company, while 43.88 percent bought them from international travel agencies. In the study period, tourists from 41 countries visited Gandaki Province. The highest number of travellers came from India, followed by France, the United States, England, and Australia.The survey found that most foreigners come for adventure activities. Besides, 24.03 percent want entertainment, 16.84 percent are interested in culture, 10.18 percent are pilgrims, 5.79 percent have other purposes, and 2.9 percent do business. The survey shows that 68 percent of tourists are first-time visitors, while 32 percent are repeat visitors. Some have visited the province as many as 30 times.The number of tourists travelling alone is 34.75 percent. Similarly, 28 percent of tourists visited with their friends, 22.50 percent with family and 14 percent in groups. \nNepal’s private sector has been sailing in troubled waters. The central bank responded to the problem experienced for the past two fiscal years by easing monetary policy and cutting rates to keep credit flowing. For the first time, the bank has admitted that the country suffered an “economic slowdown” for two consecutive years.The private sector welcomed the monetary policy for the fiscal year 2024–25, unveiled by Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari on Friday. The policy aims to ramp up support for the economy, which has been slowing, said Adhikari. “The policy targets gradual economic recovery by controlling inflation, stabilising interest rates, and ensuring credit demand.”The central bank said monetary policy had transitioned to an “easing, cautious” mode to address the demand of the private sector, which is the driver of economic growth.With easing measures, the central bank expects a double-digit private sector credit growth, increasing by 12.5 percent year-on-year in 2024-25.“The monetary policy is favourable for the private sector. It aims at economic recovery through productive use of private-sector credit,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. “There was a problem. Money had piled up in banks, and businesses were not getting it to invest. The policy has untied the knot.”The central bank said the private sector pumped Rs5.27 trillion into the economy in the last fiscal year, which ended on July 15. This accounts for 92 percent of Nepal’s economy.The growth of the construction sector also stalled in the period. In the last fiscal year, the sector, with a contribution of 5.41 percent to the economy, is projected to have dropped to 2.07 percent. To address the sector’s grievances, the monetary policy has extended the interest payment deadline for contractors to November.“It’s welcoming, though it is late,” said Rabi Singh, president of the Federation of Contractors’ Associations of Nepal. “But this is just a temporary arrangement.”“We had recommended the government for recapitalisation of the loans and interest for 2 to 5 years to stabilise the construction industry’s capital structure,” he said.The government defaulted on payment for contractors, forcing hundreds of projects to halt and eventually cause the construction sector, one of the key economic indicators, to enter a recession. “Still, we need the assurance of enough cash flow for the development of the critical infrastructure, which is also the basis for jobs creation.”Singh said the construction sector has been working on projects amounting to Rs600 billion.The central bank said the measures to cut interest rates are intended to enhance market liquidity and support economic activity in a low-inflation environment. The upper ceiling interest rate corridor has been decreased by 0.5 percentage points to 6.5 percent, and the policy rate has been reduced by 0.5 percent, to 5 percent.According to market analysts, if banks’ interest rates are low, people generally tend to invest. This will allow liquidity injections in the market without it being absorbed by the banks and the central bank.The monetary policy stated that the high liquidity in the banking system would support businesses and individuals and ease the difficulties of the private sector.The central bank said mobilising the banks’ liquidity through the private sector would support the federal government’s ambitious economic growth target. “This monetary policy will help us reach the 6 percent economic growth targeted by the federal government by keeping inflation at around 5 percent,” said Governor Adhikari. He said the central bank would manage liquidity and inject capital into the productive sector to achieve the target growth.According to the annual account estimates by the National Statistics Office, Nepal’s economic growth was estimated at 3.87 percent in the last fiscal year, in an optimistic scenario.The World Bank said in its April Nepal Development Update that economic growth is projected to accelerate to 4.6 percent in the current fiscal year, a way below the government target.“This recovery is largely attributed to the easing of monetary policy, assuming the productive use of private-sector credit,” the multilateral funding agency said. “Private sector credit contracted in the last fiscal year due to the tighter regulation on working capital loans, high lending rates, and weak domestic demand.”“The reforms to improve the business environment could attract more private investment,” according to the World Bank.On Friday, the central bank announced it would review the current working capital loans guideline. Banks and financial institutions offer short-term working capital loans to finance a company’s everyday operations.At present, industrialists and businesspeople get working capital loans of up to 25 percent of their annual turnover.For those taking more working capital loans than the set threshold, the deadline for borrowers to repay the excess credit has been extended to mid-July 2025. The central bank said it aims to maintain seven months of forex reserves to cover goods and services imports in the ongoing fiscal year 2024-25. The central bank said it would coordinate with the government to formulate necessary laws to regulate and supervise savings and credit cooperatives.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has flagged a risk to Nepal’s economy that could trigger social unrest if the ongoing cooperatives problems are not sorted out.It said that several cooperatives have collapsed in the past six months, causing a loss or freezing of client savings and creating small-scale social unrest. The IMF warned that problems in the savings and cooperatives sector are expanding.The leading cause of the failure is investment in illiquid and underperforming cooperatives’ assets, which impact repayment capacity, combined with some cases of fraud.The monetary policy said it would facilitate the government’s initiative to return Rs500,000 to each cooperatives depositor by recovering them from the directors’ properties.With a growing number of companies being blacklisted, the central bank said it had worked out a policy for the companies that are associated with the blacklisted companies but have not committed any offence.Under the policy, if one firm is blacklisted in a joint venture, it will not be mandatory to keep the other in the bad book if it has committed no offence.At present, if a person or organisation that is blacklisted owns 15 percent or more shares in any other firm, personally or institutionally, the director and executive head of such a firm or company can also be blacklisted. The central bank said it would provide collateral-free loans to migrant workers based on the assurance that remittances would be sent to the bank accounts in their home country.The NRB has extended the deadline for loan repayment to microfinance customers who failed to pay loans under various circumstances. Monetary policy has increased the limit on home loans. The bank said that the limit on home loans taken for the first time would be increased to Rs25 million from Rs20 million. It has increased the foreign exchange limit for Demand Draft/Telex Transfer facilities when importing goods to $50,000 from the existing $35,000.The existing limit for importing goods through ‘document against payment’ and ‘document against acceptance’ has been increased from $60,000 to $100,000.The monetary policy has removed the limit on share mortgage loans for institutions, which is currently Rs200 million. However, no new provision has been made on personal or individual loan limits. Currently, the share mortgage loan limit for individuals is Rs150 million, and individual share investors have been demanding an increase in this limit.  \nMG Motor India, in collaboration with JSW Group, is set to introduce an array of new vehicles into the Indian market over the next year, bolstering its presence and product offerings. The announcement comes amidst a strategic push towards electrification and expansion in mass-market and premium segments. Rajiv Chaba, president and managing director of MG Motor India, confirmed the approval for five new models slated for launch by the end of 2025. The upcoming launches include a mix of electric and hybrid vehicles catering to diverse consumer preferences. The highlight of the lineup is the MG Cloud EV, an electric MPV expected to debut in the festive season. Designed on a born-electric platform, the Cloud EV promises a spacious interior and advanced features. MG Motor India announced the Cloud EV launch following the launch of the Bingo EV hatchback, built on the Global Small Electric Vehicle (GSEV) platform, featuring a robust battery performance with up to 333 km range. In Nepal, Paramount Motors, the authorised distributor for MG Motors, is gearing up to launch the MG Cyberster this year. This innovative electric vehicle is poised to redefine the landscape of electric mobility in Nepal, offering unparalleled performance and futuristic design, the company said in a statement. \nThe Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry held a meeting with the newly appointed energy minister Dipak Khadka on Thursday in Singha Durbar, Kathmandu. The delegation, led by NICCI President Shreejana Rana, included Vice President Sunil KC, Treasurer Kunal Kayal, Executive Member Arun KC, Convener of the Energy Committee Batu Lamichhane, Deputy Director Marshal Rathour, and Finance Head Nimesh Nepal. The meeting focused on attracting foreign investments, project development, and capacity enhancement in the energy sector. These are crucial for reducing the country’s trade deficit through energy exports to India and other countries via Indian transmission lines, NICCI said in a statement. On the occasion, KC highlighted several key issues in the energy sector.  He emphasised the need for a joint mechanism involving the private sector, the Nepal Army, and government representatives to facilitate the timely import of explosives, which is crucial for project completion. He urged collaboration with the Indian and Bangladeshi governments to develop transmission lines and organise joint roadshows in India and Bangladesh to attract investments. \nOver the decade, Nepali doctors, categorised as “foreign national residents” in India’s prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), have been deprived of stipends.On June 26, Dr Indra Shekhar Prasad, the president of the Resident Doctors Association (RDA), and Raghunandan Dixit, general secretary of the RDA, wrote to the director of AIIMS and raised the issue of non-payment of stipends to the foreign national residents at AIIMS.“This long-standing grievance demands immediate redressal and your decisive intervention,” the letter said. “The RDA has tirelessly advocated for the rights of these residents, who contribute to AIIMS's mission despite facing this glaring injustice.”Most of the foreign students are from Nepal. Ekata Vyas, who campaigns on behalf of the Nepali students—estimated to number at least 60—told the Post that she is hoping for positive results this time. She has received positive feedback and responses from New Delhi and the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu. The monthly stipend ranges from IRs 90,000 to 1,20,000.Besides taking up the matter, the foreign national doctors, mostly from Nepal, took up the issue before 2011. According to the Nepali doctors who are serving in AIIMS, a case was filed in the Delhi High Court against the discriminatory provision over the stipends and arrears in 2011. The Delhi Court gave its verdict in favour of the students on July 16. In 2013, however, the AIIMS filed a counter case which was made absolute on December 4, 2017, after 27 hearings, most of them just formalities marked by absences on the bench and of defendants. A Nepali student said that since they did not have the time and resources to follow up on the case in court, it was dismissed. “Then, we started discussing the matter with government officials and diplomats,” said the student.During the Nepal visit of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in 2018, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli also took up the matter with the Indian delegation.“Then we came to know that the India prime minister's office directed the Ministry of External Affairs to look into the matter and expedite its resolution. The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu also confirmed to India’s Ministry of External Affairs that Indian students in similar courses are getting stipends equal to their Nepali counterparts from their respective institutions in Nepal. In May 2018, India’s Ministry of External Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs to examine and expedite the prime minister’s directive.Then, India’s health ministry wrote to AIIMS, the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JPIMER), and the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, seeking the details of the foreign national residents.“It is pertinent to note that esteemed institutions such as JIPMER and PGIMER have already rectified similar issues by ensuring stipend payments to their Foreign National Residents as early as 2020. AIIMS, renowned for its commitment to excellence and equity, cannot afford to lag behind in such matters of principle. As representatives of the RDA, we assert that the workload and dedication of Foreign National Residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,” the RDA stated in its letter to the AIIMS director.After two premier health institutions started providing the stipends in April 2020, the Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS wrote to the Prime Minister's Office in India seeking its intervention and solidarity with the foreign national residents who have been deprived of the stipends for the past decade.Again in May of the same year, the AIIMS association wrote to the AIIMS director to recognise the efforts by foreign national residents during the pandemic and consider resuming the stipend, but the request went unheard.In January 2023, the AIIMS issued a public notice stating that the government of Nepal should sponsor these students.Nepal’s foreign ministry then clarified that the Nepali students had competed openly and were selected on merit with no sponsorship or role of the government of Nepal. It directed the Nepali Embassy in New Delhi to look into the matter. “We took up the issue with prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and urged him to raise the matter while meeting with Modi,” said the Nepali doctors. “In September, 2023, the Supreme Court of India issued a verdict in a similar case stating that nonpayment of stipend cannot be justified.”Arguing that it is equivalent to bonded labour, the verdict directed the Medical Council to take note of instances in which the stipend is not paid.The Indian government informed the Supreme Court of India that, as per its directive, action will be taken to ensure that there is parity in medical education. “We again wrote to the foreign minister of Nepal, the Nepali Embassy, and the Indian Embassy to discuss the matter during the bilateral commission meeting scheduled for the first week of January 2024,” a Nepali doctor said.Both foreign minister NP Saud and Nepal’s ambassador Shankar Sharma took up the matter during the seventh joint commission meeting held in Kathmandu, according to the students.Then, several meetings were held, correspondence was made by the resident doctors of AIIMS, and Nepali students submitted applications to the health minister of India, people informed on the matter said.\"RDA asserts that the workload and dedication of foreign national residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,\" said RDA President Dr Inder Shekhar Prasad. \"Denial of their stipends not only undermines their morale but also tarnishes AIIMS's reputation as a beacon of medical education and equality.\"The Nepali doctors said that since India has come up with a new budget, they hope their long struggle for getting stipends will be resolved. \nDrinking water samples collected from the “Drugs-Free Society”, a Thaiba-based rehab hit by a cholera outbreak, have tested positive for faecal coliform.Officials at the Health Office Lalitpur, have reported the presence of the deadly microbes in all water samples including those from the water utility and well water.“Faecal coliform, a deadly microbe, has been detected in all water samples from the cholera-hit rehab,”said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Health Office Lalitpur. “We have started chlorinating the water to tackle the contamination.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. The presence of faecal coliform means that the drinking water being used by locals of Thaiba is contaminated with sewage, according to doctors.At least four people had tested positive for cholera that spread in the Thaiba-based rehab earlier this week.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Of the four infected patients, one in serious condition was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu. Another patient, who was admitted in the same hospital, was discharged on Wednesday, but has not gone home because the rehab has closed and he has nowhere else to go. Faecal coliform had also been detected in the study carried out on water samples collected from Godawari Municipality before the onset of monsoon.As monsoon season is an epidemic season, in which most sources of drinking water get contaminated, presence of deadly microbes—E coli, faecal coliform in drinking water is not unusual during the monsoon season, health officials say. Even jar water, which is widely considered safer compared to water from other sources, gets contaminated during the monsoon season.What concerns them much is the apathy of the responsible agencies in launching awareness drives about the risks and other preventive measures. Most local authorities across the country halted testing of drinking water just before the start of monsoon citing budget constraints.Doctors say this is not the first time that the water used by people in the Valley was found contaminated with potentially deadly microbes. What concerns them more is that water quality has not improved significantly.“Consumption of water contaminated with human faeces causes diarrheal infections,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Whatever the source, one must ensure that water is safe before drinking.”According to Basaula, the number of diarrheal cases has started rising in the hospital, and contaminated water and food are the main culprits. He said there are chances of outbreaks of diarrheal infections in multiple places where water from contaminated sources is being distributed.“Around six diarrheal patients seek treatment in our hospital every day,” said Basaula. “One must be careful about the quality of food and water before consumption.”Doctors say consumption of contaminated water not only causes diarrheal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the chances of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.Initiating awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from water-borne diseases, according to them. A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of infection, they say. \nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has alerted all agencies concerned to the risk of a Nipah virus outbreak in Nepal, as neighbouring India recently reported a death from the deadly disease.Officials said they have purchased reagents to test the virus and laboratory technicians have been trained to test samples of suspected cases.“We are aware of the Nipah virus outbreak in India and the deaths,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, chief of the Zoonotic and Other Communicable Disease Control Section. “We are closely monitoring the development and have alerted our relevant agencies to the looming risk.”India has reported an outbreak of the Nipah virus in the state of Kerala and the death of a 14-year-old boy from the infection on Sunday. An additional 60 people who came in close contact with the deceased have been identified as a high-risk group by local health authorities, according to media reports.This is the fifth outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala since 2018, according to media reports. Last year too, health authorities in India confirmed at least two deaths and three other cases of the viral infection, including a child, in the southern Indian state.Nipah is a zoonotic virus, transmitted from animals to humans, and causes a lethal swelling of the brain in humans. Transmission generally occurs when people come in close contact with infected animals or through the consumption of the meat of infected animals, according to doctors. The World Health Organisation has classified the Nipah virus as a priority pathogen due to its potential to trigger an epidemic.Transmission generally occurs when people come in direct contact with infected animals—pigs, fruit bats or through consumption of contaminated foods and meat of infected animals, according to health officials. Doctors say cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus have also been reported in many places, including in India, among the families and caregivers of the infected people.Health officials said no treatment for the Nipah virus is available. Without a vaccine having been developed, health workers provide symptomatic treatments only. “We have alerted all our sentinel sites across the country to the risks,” said Ojha. “Health workers are requested to send samples of the suspects for lab testing.”Doctors say Nepal is at risk of an outbreak of the Nipah virus, as fruit bats, which are the primary hosts of the virus, might also be present there. The Nipah virus was first detected in 1999 after farmers and others who came in close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore developed severe respiratory problems and inflammation in the brain.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 300 people were diagnosed with the disease then, and more than 100 of them died.Experts said that authorities should take the issue seriously as the virus is far deadlier than the coronavirus, with up to 75 percent death rate in humans. “The virus is much more infectious and deadlier than other respiratory viruses currently in circulation,” Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, told the Post. “Even if the primary hosts of the virus are fruit bats and pigs, this virus is transmitted from human to human through secretion and excretion. The authorities must step up surveillance.”Doctors say that fruit bats from India, which carry the Nipah virus, can easily enter Nepal due to the proximity and similar environments. Moreover, due to the free movement of people between the two countries, there is always a high chance of any disease seen in India entering Nepal.The incubation period of Nipah infection is 4 to 14 days, and its symptoms include fever, headache, convulsions, and respiratory and neurological problems.The World Health Organisation said that although the virus has caused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, it infects a wide range of animals and causes severe disease and death in people, making it a public health concern. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population on Tuesday confirmed a cholera outbreak in Thaiba of Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur district. A patient with severe diarrhoea tested positive for cholera, officials said.“A lab report confirmed cholera in a diarrhoea patient,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesperson of the Health Ministry. “Stool samples of other diarrheal patients have also been collected for testing.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Officials at the Health Office, Lalitpur told the Post that several people have been infected in a suspected cholera outbreak in the “Drug-Free Society”, a Thaiba-based drug rehab centre. Rapid diagnostic tests confirmed that at least four residents have cholera.“Out of six samples tested, four came positive for cholera,” an official at the municipality told the Post on condition of anonymity. “One patient, in serious condition with severe diarrhoea, has been admitted to the intensive care unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital.”All four infected people were referred to Sukraraj hospital on Monday by the local health authority. But three of them fled the hospital on Monday night, according to Health Ministry officials. “Three patients, who tested positive in rapid diagnostic tests, escaped through the window of the hospital’s toilet on Monday night,” said spokesperson Budhathoky. “Another patient, whose condition is serious, is being treated in intensive care at the hospital. The patient, who tested positive for cholera, has been admitted to a cabin in the hospital.” Officials said that patients might have fled the hospital to avoid returning to the rehab.Following news of the suspected cholera outbreak, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, the agency responsible for responding to the disease outbreaks, mobilised a team of health workers to the rehab.“Samples of water and stools have been collected from the rehab centre,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. The Kathmandu Valley often witnesses cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season, with hundreds of people suffering from diarrheal infections that continue for months.In May, a 62-year-old man from Makawanpur district, who had been hospitalised with severe diarrhoea, tested positive for the deadly disease. The man is said to have been living in Kathmandu for a long time.In 2022, a total of 77 cases of cholera were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Experts say that a cholera outbreak in the Valley during the monsoon is particularly concerning. Rainwater contaminates most water sources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected with water-borne diseases, including cholera. Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main drivers of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. According to the World Health Organisation, a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.A combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise.

Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepalese table tennis player Santoo Shrestha lost to Senegal's Ibrahima Diaw in the Olympics preliminary round, marking Nepal's debut in the sport at the event.\nVenezuelans anticipate Sunday election results amidst concerns about fairness, with the opposition hoping for a victory against the ruling socialist party that has faced economic and political crises.\nVenezuelans vote in crucial election amidst opposition concerns and President Maduro's warnings of violence.\n A rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights killed 12 people including children on Saturday, Israeli authorities said, blaming Hezbollah and vowing to inflict a heavy price on the Iran-backed Lebanese group.Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the strike, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since the start of the conflict in Gaza.The attack sharply escalated tensions in the hostilities which have been fought in parallel to the Gaza war and has raised fears of a full-blown conflict between the heavily armed adversaries.The rocket struck a football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.“Hezbollah will pay a heavy price, the kind it has thus far not paid,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a phone call with the leader of the Druze community in Israel, according to a statement from his office.In a written statement, Hezbollah said: “The Islamic Resistance has absolutely nothing to do with the incident, and categorically denies all false allegations in this regard”.Hezbollah had earlier announced several rocket attacks targeting Israeli military positions.The Israeli ambulance service said 13 more people were wounded by the rocket that hit the soccer pitch which was filled at the time with children and teenagers.“They were playing soccer, they heard sirens they ran to shelter.. it may take them like 15 seconds (to reach the shelter). But they couldn’t reach the shelter because the rocket hit the site between the ground and the shelter,” said Mourhaf Abu Saleh, a witness.Footage posted on social media showed the moment the rocket hit. An air raid siren can be heard, followed by a big explosion and images of smoke rising. Reuters was able to independently verify the location with the buildings and road layout that matched the satellite imagery of the area.Idan Avshalom, a medic with the Magen David Adom ambulance service, said first responders arrived to a scene of great destruction. “There were casualties on the grass and the scene was gruesome,” he said.Netanyahu, already due to head back from the United States to Israel overnight on Saturday, said he would bring his flight forward and convene his security cabinet upon arrival.The United States, which has been leading diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalating the conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border, condemned it as a horrific attack and said U.S. support for Israel’s security was “iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah”.The United States “will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority,” the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement. The Blue Line refers to the frontier between Lebanon and Israel.Iranian missileThe Israeli military said the rocket launch was carried out from an area located north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon.Speaking with reporters at Majdal Shams, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that forensics showed the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq-1.Hezbollah had earlier announced firing a Falaq-1 missile on Saturday, saying it had targeted an Israeli military headquarters.In a televised statement, Hagari also said that for now there was no change in Home Front Command instructions, indicating the army was not expecting imminent escalation across Israel.Netanyahu’s far-right coalition ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, called for tough retaliation, including against Hezbollah’s leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.“For the death of children, Nasrallah should pay with his head. All of Lebanon should pay,” Smotrich posted on X.The conflict has forced tens of thousands of people in both Lebanon and Israel to leave their homes. Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists.The Israeli military said after Saturday’s attack the death toll among civilians killed in Hezbollah attacks had risen to 23 since October, along with at least 17 soldiers.Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the UNIFIL peacekeeping force which operates in southern Lebanon, told Reuters its force commander was in contact with authorities in both Lebanon and Israel “to understand the details of the Majdal Shams incident and to maintain calm”.A senior diplomat focused on Lebanon said all efforts were now needed to avoid an all-out war.Attacks from LebanonHezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East that have entered the fray in support of their Palestinian ally Hamas since October.Iraqi groups and the Houthis of Yemen have both fired at Israel. Hamas has also carried out rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon, as has the Lebanese Sunni group, the Jama’a Islamiya.More than 40,000 people live on the Israeli-occupied Golan, more than half of them Druze residents. The Druze are an Arab minority who practice an offshoot of Islam.The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building.At least 30 rockets were then fired from Lebanon across the border, the military said.Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks. \nJuddha Shumsher's zoo, initially a private space for his family, contained a wide range of animals, including elephants, horses, deer, monkeys, tigers, rhinos, leopards, red pandas, bears, palm civets, four-horned antelopes, Himalayan gorals, pheasants, Himalayan monals, gharial crocodiles, porcupines, and even lions.\nUnauthorized translations of famous books by authors like Taslima Nasrin, Steve Jobs, and Robert Kiyosaki flood Nepal's book market, harming authors, publishers, and readers, despite the country's copyright law.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nHow safe a place is Pakistan for young women? According to the human rights ministry, in the last three years, 63,000 cases of violence against women were reported here. This is a rough estimate as not every case of violence is brought to public notice. In fact, it is just the tip of the iceberg.A fuller picture of the state of human security in Pakistan emerges from the Trafficking in Persons Report issued annually since 2001 by the US State Department. The 2024 report was released recently. From this document, one learns of the complexity and severity of the problems created by criminal trafficking in Pakistan.Fundamentally, trafficking violates a victim’s constitutional rights to freedom and to live with dignity in a place of her/his choice. The trafficker’s basic motive is monetary gain. In today’s age of neo-liberalism, trafficking has emerged as a global crime involving a transnational mafia conducting a multibillion-dollar trade reminiscent of the slave trade of yore.Unfortunately, Pakistan as a source, transit and destination country occupies a strategic position in this heinous business. Its inability—or is it unwillingness?—to check unscrupulous elements sustains the mafia that keeps this sordid trade going. It is a lucrative source of illegal earning for the psychopath. As for the mass majority, poverty, gender inequality and illiteracy are the factors that make them so vulnerable.For unexplained reasons, not many voices have been raised against this crime against humanity. The numbers affected should jolt our conscience. According to a modest estimate, nearly 20,000 persons (80 per cent of them women) are trafficked in Pakistan every year. TIP reports from 2017 to 2021 had showed figures rising from 12,000 to 32,000. In 2022, when a kidnapped girl was recovered in Lahore and taken to court, the police spoke of 40,500 girls having been abducted in Punjab alone. For me, even one woman trafficked is one too many.It is difficult to understand why state and society accept with equanimity a social evil with profound implications for a country that claims to be an Islamic entity, and which impacts our economy, moral fibre and national image.The latest TIP Report confirms this trend. It informs us that in the investigating period (2023), the government probed 18,461 cases of which 15,022 were of sex trafficking and 3,439 of forced labour. Of these, only 6,178 were prosecuted, with a measly 10 convictions. The 2023 report had revealed a similar pattern of high numbers being investigated, followed by a drop in the number of prosecutions and a scanty lot being convicted. The punishment meted out is not disclosed. It would not be surprising if no one is imprisoned and a fine of only a few hundred thousand is imposed.How has the government reacted to this annual finger-pointing exercise by Washington? One response was to neutralise the pressure by setting up the National Commission on Human Rights in 2015, which has the mandate to address suo motu cases of human rights violations, create public awareness and conduct research on human rights matters. It also makes recommendations to the government on related issues. Consequently, Pakistan has amended existing laws and adopted new ones, the most important being the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018.The same year, the NCHR published the report The Menace of Trafficking/Smuggling: Pakistan’s Response to the Problem. Well documented, it focuses on the problem in its local setting. The law and order machinery dealing with trafficking problems has also been restructured, with the FIA being assigned to see to the international aspects of trafficking.The creation of the NCHR notwithstanding, the situation vis-à-vis trafficking in Pakistan continues to be horrendous. No one in official circles talks about it. Hence it is left to the TIP Report to expose the truth.Year after year, TIP reports have reiterated that Pakistan does not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Inadequacy, inefficiency and shoddiness in investigation is something we are all familiar with. I have experienced it whenever I have had to deal with the police. What leaves one aghast is the charge of the government being hand in glove with the criminals. TIP 2024 states: “For the fifth year, the government did not take adequate action against credible reports of official complicity in trafficking crimes, which also continued to create a culture of impunity and inhibited anti-trafficking efforts. In Sindh, local officials continued to perpetrate bonded labour with impunity in brick kilns and on farms.”In Pakistan, money can buy a criminal's acquittal and traffickers are multimillionaires. If they also enjoy the blessings of the powers that be then what do they have to worry about?-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nUnintended pregnancy, teenage pregnancy and induced abortive procedures with complications are some common reproductive health problems affecting millions of females worldwide. These issues are major causes of maternal mortality and morbidity in South Asia, posing a significant challenge to women’s sexual and reproductive health as well as social well-being and economic prospects.In Nepal, nearly half of the pregnancies are unintended and 60 percent of them end up in abortion. This directly correlates with gender inequality, socio-economic status and restrictions on sexual and reproductive rights. Early and unintended pregnancies also pose a huge barrier to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3.7, which ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including family planning, information and education and integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. Nepal's National Planning Commission 2020 states, \"The government of Nepal’s target for SDG 3.7.1, is that 74% of allwomen age 15–49 have a met need for family planning with modern methods by 2022 and 80% by 2030.\"Advancement of contraceptivesOver the past few decades, there have been tremendous advances in the development of new contraceptive technologies, and a wide variety of family planning methods have been introduced. According to the National Demographic Health Survey 2022 (NDHS), 57 percent of currently married women are using a method of contraception, 43 percent are using a modern technique, and 15 percent are using a traditional method. There has been a decline in the unmet need for family planning from 32 percent in 1996 to 21 percent in 2022, which is possibly due to contraceptives.While different methods of contraception have prevented unintended pregnancies, emergency contraceptives are on the rise today. Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are safe and effective drugs, recommended to be used within 72 hours after unprotected sexual intercourse, after accidents like condom rupture or missed pills, or if women are forced against their will to prevent pregnancy. ECPs help women avoid the adverse outcomes of unwanted pregnancies and reduce the risk of induced abortion. Offering emergency contraception is a crucial service delivery intervention for reducing this unmet need for contraception. As the name itself says, emergency contraceptives are intended only for occasional and emergency use. Counselling for the use of these pills should include options for regular contraception and advice on the correct methods in cases of perceived method failure. Concerns regarding ECPsNepal first introduced emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) through a social marketing programme in 2004. Since then, its use has risen, particularly in the last decade. The serious concerns regarding the potential use of ECP as a substitute for other contraceptives are similar to those voiced in response to the increased use of abortion in Nepal. The increased availability of over-the-counter and easy accessibility of emergency contraceptives has raised concerns regarding their safe use, misuse and potential consequences. The trend of taking ECPs as an alternative method of contraception should be seriously considered, particularly among youth. The wide advertisements, banners and posters around street corners stating it is an “easy way to the difficult situation” have misled them to either abandon or consider not using the contraceptive method regularly. It provides easy options for women to avoid unwanted or unplanned births without having to face social stigmatisation.Globally, the increasing use of ECPs has been described as an epidemic in which women are reportedly “eating contraceptives like chocolates” in Kenya and “popping them like candy” in India. The condition is similar in the context of Nepal today, where the pills are taken as a substitute for regular contraceptives. It might replace the regular use of oral combined pills, which in turn can lead to menstrual irregularities because of off-and-on withdrawal bleeding. This problem not only harms women but also potentially increases sexually transmitted diseases (STI) and HIV when condom use is replaced by repeated, indiscriminate use of emergency contraceptives. It will also deprive young women and girls of reaching out to the gynaecologist for appropriate counselling services and to consider various options regarding regular contraceptives. There is no doubt that emergency contraceptives provide a woman with the opportunity to have unprotected intercourse and ensure that every pregnancy is wanted. However, repeated misuse of emergency contraceptives needs to be evaluated for a better understanding of the positive and negative impacts of ECPs, which is critical in guiding the discourse in the right direction. Existing policies lack comprehensive implementation guidelines for the distribution of emergency contraceptive pills, necessitating integration. Comprehensive sexual health programmes and education campaigns through social media, workshops, community outreach initiatives on reproductive health and family planning methods and emergency contraceptives should be conducted. Health education on ECPs should be integrated into the curriculum to bridge the knowledge gap among youths. Similarly, equipping teachers to offer detailed sex education in urban and rural schools, incorporating public education campaigns to raise awareness about ECPs and their importance as a backup method of contraception, integrating counselling services into healthcare settings, and enhancing the competencies of paramedics, community leaders and female community health volunteers to provide basic adolescent services are urgently needed. The media, programme implementors, service providers, decision-makers and policymakers should have the right and accurate information on ECPs. There is an urgent need to disseminate information regarding family planning, pregnancy risks and contraceptive use to dispel myths and ensure the proper use of ECPs. An integrated approach is required to address the interrelated factors and create an enabling environment in which adolescents are fully aware, informed and equipped to properly utilise contraceptives and related services. As Jeff Sheffield, chairman of FIGO’s Contraception and Family Planning Committee, said, “Globally, young people, especially adolescents, do not have access to reliable, up-to-date information related to sexual and reproductive health, including contraception. This information can help inform their decisions and potentially save lives.” Let’s ponder this issue seriously.  \nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has its feet in two boats: Business and regulation. This is always a recipe for disaster. And in Nepal’s aviation sector, disasters are aplenty. Under the current director general, Pradeep Adhikari, Nepal has seen seven air crashes. In the past year-and-a-half alone, over 100 people have been killed in plane crashes. And no, the director-general hasn’t resigned yet, he in fact continues to vehemently defend his sullied record. The terms ‘accountability’ and ‘humility’ are clearly missing from his book of ethics. With the right connections across the political spectrum, he has no moral or political pressure to resign. The half-mast national flag does his task of hanging his head in shame.A European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) delegation that conducted an on-site assessment of Nepal’s air safety last September pointed out several safety concerns, clearly mentioning a couple of airline carriers and CAAN as the offending parties. An assessment report submitted to CAAN’s Adhikari raised concerns about discrepancies in the work of the Flight Operations Division and the Airworthiness Inspection Division. It noted significant gaps in overseeing fatigue related to duty period regulations and ensuring comprehensive compliance checks. The report also suggested improvement in CAAN’s oversight capabilities, personnel management, staff training and certification processes.How the CAAN has responded to the European Commission’s concerns about Nepal’s air safety over the years is there for all to see: More crashes and more killings. The commission’s request to bifurcate the civil aviation body into regulatory and service-providing institutions has fallen on deaf ears. Similarly, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the United Nations aviation watchdog, asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body and ensure a proper regulatory system two years ago. Not splitting the CAAN has created a serious conflict of interest as the same institution seeks to provide service as well as to make profit. However, Adhikari kept the report a secret, continuing to stall efforts to split CAAN.A poignant case of regulation failure was evident in the death of the wife and son of a technician who were among the 18 individuals killed in the Saurya Air crash near the runway of the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu on Wednesday. The ferry flight to Pokhara on a full maintenance mission was not supposed to carry common passengers, but it did—an egregious violation of air safety rules. As corruption and lack of accountability run rampant in Nepal’s aviation industry, with little adherence to existing regulations, air travel continues to be a risky endeavour.The captain of the ill-fated Bombardier CRJ200, who miraculously survived the crash, has made an initial statement that he could not control the aircraft after it took an altitude of a hundred feet after take-off. He would be in a position to provide more insight into the events leading up to the fatal crash of the aircraft when he regains his health. In Nepal, there has been a tradition of putting all the blame on human agency, meaning the captain, after all fatal air crashes, without making any effort to strengthen air safety regulations. No corrupt leader or bureaucrat should be allowed to perennially stop the bifurcation of CAAN and to continue to let our skies be aerial death traps.   \nNepali political parties of the Left, Right and Centre never tire of speaking about democracy. Their concern is often about democracy being in some kind of danger, although it is mostly a case of false flagging. But there is one kind of democracy they rarely talk about—the intra-party sort. Practising internal democracy seems much more difficult than seeking it elsewhere. A couple of party conventions in the past few months have highlighted the lack of internal democracy among Nepali political parties. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal), which concluded its three-day ‘unity general convention’ on June 12, elected Upendra Yadav as chairperson. Although the party announced its central committee members and central executive committee members after a month of the convention, it has failed to pick office bearers. Likewise, the CPN (Unified Socialist), which completed its six-day ‘national convention’ on July 5, elected Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal, and Ghanashyam Bhusal as chairman, senior leader, and general secretary, respectively, through consensus among the party’s top leaders. However, the party has yet to name its 206 central committee members and 18 office bearers.Once Yadav of the JSP-Nepal was elected to the chair unopposed, he halted the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13. Twenty-three candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons, and six were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—had filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary. Similarly, the Unified Socialist has yet to appoint 206 of 299 central committee members and 18 of 21 committee members in addition to finalising standing committee and politburo members. Party insiders say the top brass was busy scrutinising the backgrounds of the aspirants before making a final selection. But scrutinising may mean picking ‘yes’ men and women, especially considering the volatile nature of these parties which are either splinters from a big party or have seen their colleagues break away to form other parties.Apart from these rather fringe parties in Parliament, those that are more mainstream also struggle with the question of internal democracy. The Rastriya Swatantra Party’s joint meeting of central committee and parliamentary party set the tone for the party’s cult culture, with Rabi Lamichhane picking officer bearers considered close to him. There have also been controversies regarding an alleged manipulation of the proportional representation list to include near and dear ones of the party top brass.The situation in the top three parties—Nepali Congress, CPN (UML) and Maoist Centre—is no better. The Congress reflects a perennial vertical division of the Deuba and Koirala camps; the UML is increasingly being consolidated around the “father” figure of KP Sharma Oli, and the Maoists remain as enamoured as ever by the authoritative personality of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. With individual preferences rather than democratic values ruling the roost, the parties sustain on a feudal system offering handouts, or “tika” in the local parlance, to the sycophants while pushing away those who work hard and question the top brass. If there is one sphere that has seen a thriving “Afno Manchhe” culture—which anthropologist Dor Bahadur Bista so eloquently critiqued in his book Fatalism and Development—it is the political parties of Nepal today.  \nNepal, a country that was long in the clutches of poliovirus, made a significant stride when in 2014 the United Nations declared it “polio-free”. However, the recent detection of type-3 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV)—active viruses in the oral polio vaccine—in Kathmandu’s sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers indicates a potential outbreak. Although no one has been infected, the presence of the virus in sewage is in itself concerning. This calls for a prompt response from the authorities, as it could put Nepal’s achievements on polio at risk. According to the World Health Organisation, polio or poliomyelitis mainly affects children under five (but anyone unvaccinated is at risk). It is a water-borne disease and is transmitted through unhygienic habits, droplets or aerosols, faecal contamination, infected utensils, food and water. Infection from the virus has declined (by 99 percent) worldwide since 1988, but the WHO warns that “as long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk”. South Asian countries Pakistan and Afghanistan have also reported wild polio in wastewater in recent months. This means the risk of contagion in Nepal is far from over, and we can no longer be complacent. The emergence of VDPVs, as per the WHO and studies, is associated with low immunisation coverage. Vaccination is thus crucial to contain the spread of polio. Nepal has undertaken many vaccine campaigns against it. Still, as per the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, at least 4 percent of children aged 12-23 months have not been jabbed against any disease. The vaccine coverage rate for polio, according to the Health Ministry, is 95 throughout the country. So, the virus could strike under-vaccinated and unvaccinated children at any time. For successful eradication of the poliovirus back in 2014, the country’s efforts included routine vaccine campaigns, door-to-door calls, additional national and subnational mass vaccination campaigns, surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis, mop-up campaigns, and the introduction of injected vaccines in addition to oral vaccines. It’s time the government and healthcare authorities dusted off their old knowledge and kits. However, studies show that vaccines alone don’t help. A recent article, “Polio in Gaza: What Does This Mean For the Region and the World?” in The Conversation highlights how maintaining sanitation and hygiene can help eradicate polio.Health authorities and donor agencies have arranged special vaccination drives in Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur and are launching the campaign from today, and it will continue till July 27. They must ensure that not a single child is deprived or missed and also focus on virus surveillance in other districts and start jabbing children wherever necessary. Despite this initiative, a recent Post report highlights a significant disparity in the country’s approach to sample collection: They are taken from five tributary rivers in the Kathmandu Valley, Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces; other provinces are excluded. This isn’t comprehensive enough as poliovirus could be detected anywhere, given the constant flow of people, in and out of the country.The situation demands that the government develop country-wide monitoring, vaccination campaigns and sanitation programmes without further ado. If these measures are not prioritised, it could be a matter of time before we have another polio wave on our hands.   \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli secured a resounding majority in the House of Representatives on Sunday. Getting 188 votes in the 275-strong chamber, Oli showed the backing of over two-thirds members of the lower house. This in itself is a positive start to a new stint as prime minister for Oli. A powerful government is in the interest of the country that has been reeling under economic crisis, unemployment and other problems. However, securing an overwhelming House majority at the start of the term is nothing new for a Nepali prime minister. CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who secured over 97 percent votes in the House in January 2023, had to go for the floor test three more times before he was ousted earlier this month. In the fourth vote, he was supported by only 22 percent of the members of the same House.When KP Sharma Oli became prime minister for the second time in February 2018, he returned to Singhadurbar with a strong mandate as the erstwhile left alliance of the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) won a resounding majority in the 2017 general elections. In May the same year, they converted the left alliance into a single unified party making Oli a strong prime minister, commanding an overwhelming majority in the federal parliament. But this unified force fell apart and the two mother parties were revived in March 2021. When the Supreme Court in July 2021 ousted Oli, the UML chair lost not only the trust of other parties but also the support of many lawmakers from his own party. These are just a few instances. If history is any guide, securing a big parliamentary majority at the start means little if cannot be protected for any length of time. The goal should rather be to use this strength for the benefit of the country’s larger good.The country needs a strong government and political stability—more specifically, policy consistency. The government in place in turn urgently needs to address pressing issues—prolonged economic stagnation, slow development activities, unemployment, brain drain, corruption. But the mother of all problems is the protracted economic crisis. So the top priority should be to fix the economy. This done, many other things will fall into place.Prime Minister Oli is praised not only by his party comrades but also the rivals for his bold decision making capacity. But he is also often accused of bulldozing others’ views. This is also why in 2021 he irked many leaders within his party as well as chiefs of other political forces and lost their support. Oli’s statements after becoming prime minister last week suggest a change. The remarks he has made in the House on domestic as well as foreign relations are more balanced this time. The prime minister must not forget that the support of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, has made it possible for him to return to power with a strong parliamentary support. His relations, mainly with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, is going to be crucial. Just as was the case during his previous tenures, Oli’s success this time will depend on whether he can accommodate other viewpoints, both from in and out of the ruling coalition. This, unfortunately, has not always been his strong suit.  \nNepal's Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has made technological advancements in weather forecasting but faces challenges in coping with climate change, emphasizing the need for updated policies, expertise, and improved outreach for life-saving early warning systems.\n Amidst a volatile political climate, the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML formed a government, ousting Pushpa Kamal Dahal and reshaping the nation's leadership.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAt least 140 people have died and 2,268 families have been affected by floods and landslides since the June 10 onset of the monsoon this year. Among the affected families, hundreds have been displaced from their homes. Owing to the government’s apathy, those who have been taking refuge in schools, community homes and in barns of the neighbours and relatives have been deprived of immediate relief money to build temporary shelters.“We don’t have the budget even to provide an immediate relief amount to those displaced in various disasters,” said Anil Pokhrel, chief executive officer of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). “Hundreds of families are still waiting for relief money so that they can build makeshift shelters.”Living in schools, community homes and cattle sheds for a long time is not easy. School administrations often ask the displaced people to vacate, as their presence disrupts regular classes. Officials concede that displaced people make daily rounds of the local authorities and homes of elected representatives, hoping to get the first tranche of relief amounts, but they return disappointed.“We have asked for Rs250 million to provide immediate relief to the displaced, so that they can start building temporary shelters, but the Ministry of Finance has released only Rs30 million. This is insufficient to meet the needs of hundreds of victims,” said an official at the authority, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Officials admit that the authority is unable to release relief money not only for those displaced during the ongoing monsoon, but also for the victims of the rain-related disasters from 2020.They say the number of disaster victims, who have been waiting for relief amounts, is in the thousands.“There are over 1,700 displaced families in our district,” said Rabiraj Dhital, Information officer at District Administration Office, Sindhupalchok. “Of the total number of displaced, around 1,000 have received the first tranche to begin building houses, and 400 have received the second tranche. The reality is that most victims’ homes remain unfinished due to the authorities’ failure to offer timely relief, leaving them in pitiable conditions.”The government has decided to provide Rs550,000 to the disaster victims. Of this amount, 15 percent will come from the respective local units, 30 percent from the provincial government, and 55 percent from the federal government.“Had the federal and provincial government agencies told us that they would not provide anything, we would have made a decision on the relief amount ourselves,” said Aitaman Tamang, chairman of Melamchi Municipality. “Every day, displaced people come to my office and even to my home asking for relief, but I can’t make any decisions.”Officials at the NDRRMA said that the delay by the Cabinet in approving recent changes in relief-related guidelines is the main reason displaced people haven’t received relief money. “Those displaced by the Jajarkot earthquakes got Rs50,000 in immediate relief to start building temporary shelters,” said chief executive officer Pokhrel. “The guidelines’s approval would allow similar support for families affected by other disasters, particularly floods, fire, and landslides.”Pokhrel said that the guidelines have now been submitted for the Cabinet’s approval, and once approved, the authority will be able to provide similar support to families affected by floods and landslides.Nepal is highly vulnerable to natural disasters like earthquakes, landslides and floods. The country, however, struggles to effectively manage large-scale disasters, experts say. They say the reactive approach of the authorities concerned is responsible for the loss of lives and property.The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has forecast above-normal rains and above-average temperatures the monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Several districts have already experienced incidents of landslides, floods and lightning since the monsoon season began.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, at least 1,140 people have died, while 120 others are missing due to landslides, floods, and lightning since June 10.Officials at the authority said 86 people—41 males and 40 females—have been killed in landslides, 26 in floods—11 males and 15 females—and 23 more in lightning strikes. Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.The NDRRMA estimates that 1.81 million people and 412,000 households will be affected by monsoon this year. Of them, 83,000 households will be directly hit, and 18,000 families will require rescue from monsoon-related disasters. \nMPs have raised serious concerns over the delays in implementing air safety measures, blaming the government for making Nepal’s civil aviation notorious worldwide. Sunday’s parliamentary deliberation comes in response to the July 24 crash of Saurya Airlines CRJ-200 that killed 18 people. The flight captain miraculously survived the crash as the cockpit broke off upon impact.The clips circulating on social media sites show that a minute after takeoff, the plane went out of control just a few hundred feet off the ground.The aircraft tilted to the right, with its wing tip hitting the ground in seconds before the plane swerved to its left and hit a container. By the time the plane came to rest in the ravine, it had already been engulfed in a huge ball of fire.“120 people have been killed in the past two years in air disasters. How can anyone forget the pain?” questioned Nepali Congress lawmaker Sanjay Kumar Gautam.He questioned the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal's role. “What is it? A regulator or a service provider? What's its role?“Where are the civil aviation bills? We need to bring the bills to Parliament immediately.”Two long-pending aviation bills—the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Bill and the Air Service Authority of Nepal Bill—envisage splitting Nepal’s aviation body into two entities—service provider and regulator, a condition for Nepal to be struck off the European Commission’s air safety list.The government first announced the proposal in its Three Year Interim Plan 2007-08 to 2009-10, which stated, “In the context of the completion of the study on the institutional strengthening of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, which has been working as the service provider in civil aviation, airport operator and regulator; implementation of doable recommendations suggested by the report are being considered.”Since then, every periodic plan and policy, including the annual budget, has prioritised separating the civil aviation body. But the idea has never been implemented.Nepali Congress Lawmaker Rajendra Bajgain informed the House that there have been seven air accidents in the past two years alone. He said the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has asked to separate regulatory and service work in Nepal’s air service. “But that has not been done.”“Look at the situation of the airport of Nepal’s capital city. Nepal’s tourism is in a coma due to the frequent crashes. Corruption has plagued the aviation industry,” he told Parliament, demanding immediate reform measures so that people would not have to die while flying.Lawmaker Sunita Baral, the whip of the CPN-UML Parliamentary Party, said that the risk to Nepal’s air safety is increasing. “The crashes have been taking place one after another. This will seriously affect the tourism industry.”“A flight comes down within a minute of take-off. How does that happen?”She said that Nepal has seen tourism as a catalyst for economic prosperity. “But if air travel is unsafe, it sends a bad message.”Baral said that the investigation commission should probe the matter seriously.However, as MPs have expected, a probe commission cannot blame a person or to prosecute them even if it finds them guilty. Experts say that under ICAO Annex 13 to the International Civil Aviation Convention, states must investigate an air accident and incident or delegate the responsibility of looking into accidents in their territory to another entity.However, the sole objective of an Annex 13 investigation is to prevent accidents and incidents and generate safety data and information to avoid similar accidents or incidents in the future. Therefore, Annex 13 investigations do not concern themselves with apportioning blame or liability.Any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability will be separate. In Nepal, there is no single example of a judicial or criminal proceeding in 108 air incidents spanning the country’s 71-year-old aviation history. The civil aviation service started in Nepal in 1953 with three old American-made DC-3 Dakotas belonging to an Indian company. After five years, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation was established.House members on Sunday wanted an investigation so that those responsible for such disastrous incidents are punished. However, that’s possible only when the court or the government pursues criminal charges for operators and regulators for failing to comply with the rules. In a recent example, Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a US criminal fraud charge stemming from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners, angering the families of the hundreds of passengers killed who had wanted the case to go to trial.In October 2018, 189 people were killed when Lion Air Flight 610 fell into the Java Sea off Indonesia. In March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa airport, claiming 157 lives.Another lawmaker, Purna Bahadur Gharti, also demanded a fair investigation into the crash. Lawmaker Rajendra Lingden questioned how non-technicians were allowed to board the ferry flight. The plane was scheduled to fly to Pokhara for C-check, heavy maintenance. “It looks like even the regulator was unaware of who was on board.”He pointed to the regulator’s negligence. “We have also heard that the civil aviation body hastily allowed the operation of the new Pokhara International Airport in January last year.”On January 15, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed while approaching the airport. The Post, too, had reported that flight calibration, which tests all equipment at the new airport, had not recommended landing from the west, the path followed by the Yeti flight.Experts at that time had pointed out how the flight procedure was not published. Airlines had very little information on airport procedures and data.No evaluation was carried out as required by the ‘safety management system’, neither by the civil aviation regulator, as an airport service provider, nor by the airlines.“The civil aviation body misused its regulator role to operate the airport, neglecting safety requirements. It was a serious crime and mass murder, and subject to criminal investigation,” one aviation expert had said at the time.Speaking in the House on Sunday, Lawmaker Prabhu Sah said that the frequent crashes have sent a message that Nepal’s air safety is poor. “The relevant agencies should be held responsible and accountable for this.” \nFive people, including three members of a family, are missing in a landslide at Gumda in ward 5 of Dharche Rural Municipality in Gorkha district, on Sunday.The landslide triggered by heavy rains swept away an agricultural farm and a house at around 3am. The landslide started from the Nansen Community Forest just above the settlement.According to the District Police Office in Gorkha, farm owner Jit Bahadur Gurung (37), his wife Kanchhi Gurung (35), his father Sulal Kanchha Gurung (60), Ramesh Gurung (33) and tractor driver Ramesh Pariyar are missing in the nature’s fury. Two others were injured.“Search is on for the missing people with the help of an excavator. But the rescuers could not locate them till the evening,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Ramesh Kumar Shrestha on Sunday. He said police teams were dispatched from the Barpak and Machakhola police posts to the incident site.The local people and the security personnel of the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army have been searching for the victims. “The search has been difficult as the debris buried a large area,” said Shrestha.According to the locals, they heard a bang apparently of the landslide that instantly buried the agricultural farm and another house. “My house is near the landslide. I was woken up by the sounds of some stones hitting the tin roof, and saw that the mudslide had already buried the farm and another house,” said Sanjaya Gurung, a local. “Some workers working at a local hydropower project had been staying in Jit Bahadur’s house. Some of them survived as they could flee on time,” he added.Thirty-year-old Dilip Gurung and 27-year-old Chham Bahadur Gurung were injured in the incident and were found only in the morning. They sustained injuries while attempting to flee the landslide.“It is suspected that the people staying upstairs ran away while those staying on the ground floor went missing in the incident,” said Raj Gurung, a local involved in the search operation.The injured duo were flown to Kathmandu for further treatment. According to DSP Shrestha, the injured were taken to Kathmandu by a chopper of Kailash Helicopter Services. Dilip Gurung, who has multiple injuries, is in critical condition, while Chham’s condition has been reported to be stable. They are receiving treatment at Grande Hospital in Kathmandu, said police.Meanwhile, landslides and floods disrupted vehicular movements on various roads in different parts of the country on Sunday.The Dumre-Besisahar and Besisahar-Chame road sections in Lamjung district were blocked for hours. A landslide at ward 6 of Besisahar Municipality blocked the Besisahar-Chame road, which is the only route connecting Lamjung with Manang district and leads to the northern parts of the district.Transportation resumed in the late afternoon after the security personnel cleared the debris in both the Dumre-Besisahar and the Besisahar-Chame road sections. “Vehicular movement began after repairing the damaged roads,” said Police Inspector Meghnath Chapagain.Landslides erupted in multiple locations, including Dalal Kshetra, Udipur Bazar, Andheri Khola, and near the Nepali Army Gate along the Dumre-Besisahar road section.According to the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, heavy rainfall was recorded in Besisahar, Khudi Bazar, Kunchha, Gharedhunga, and several other areas of Lamjung for three hours starting from 4:30am on Sunday.Similarly, landslides disrupted two routes connecting Hetauda with Kathmandu. According to the police, the Kanti Highway was obstructed in several areas due to the landslides.Deputy Superintendent of Police Lakshmi Bhandari of the District Police Office, Makawanpur, said they are coordinating with the roads department to resume traffic along the road.Similarly, the Hetauda-Bhimphedi-Kulekhani road section was also obstructed due to a landslide in ward 4 of Bhimphedi Rural Municipality.Likewise, the Charikot-Singati road section was blocked due to damage from heavy rainfall.The Area Police Office at Singati, said parts of the road collapsed and were washed away by landslides. With the obstruction in vehicular movement, communication with the northern region has also been disrupted.The police said alternative routes in the rural parts are also blocked due to rain, creating difficulties in transportation. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nNepal’s swimmer Duana Lama failed to progress beyond the Heat in the women’s 200 m freestyle event at the Paris Olympics 2024 on Sunday.Lama took 2 minutes 20.74 seconds to complete the distance, finishing last in the Heat 1 and in the 30th position overall at the Paris Aquatics Centre. A total of 31 swimmers representing 27 countries had entered the event.Players with top 16 times in the Heat qualified for the semi-finals.Lama’s timing in Paris could not even beat her previous best of 2 minutes 12.46 seconds.Gaurika Singh holds the national record in the women’s 200 m freestyle with 2:11.94 seconds.Coach Nayana Shakya said Lama was suffering an ankle injury which affected her performance in the pool.“She arrived at the pool following a three-day treatment and physiotherapy. But she bravely did it,” said Shakya.Lama’s exit from the Heat is not surprising however. Since making a debut in Atlanta 1996, a total of 13 swimmers have now represented Nepal in the Olympics swimming pool but none have succeeded in progressing past the Heat.Alexander Shah, who is competing in the men’s 100 m freestyle, is in action on Tuesday.-Nepal finish 42nd in shooting-Shooter Sushmita Nepal also could not do much as she finished in the 42nd position in the women’s 10 m air rifle qualification event.Nepal scored 104.2 in the first series, 101.7 in the second, 100.7 in the third, 99.9 in the fourth, 102.2 in the fifth and 98.8 in the sixth for a total score of 607.8 at the National Shooting Centre in Chateauroux.Only Luna Solomon of the Refugee Olympic Team finished below her with a score of 601.2.Only the top eight shooters reached the final round.Shooter Nepal holds the national record of 619.1 in the event which she set during the selection tournament of the 19th Asian Games. Nepal has regularly participated in shooting at the Olympics since Seoul 1988—except for Rio 2016. The country has sent women’s shooters in the 10 m air rifle event to all the Olympics except for Rio 2016 and Athens 2004—Nepal did not participate in shooting in Rio and sent men’s athletes in the 10 m air rifle event in Athens— but none has made it to the finals.-Prince Dahal lose to world number two Axelson-Nepal’s badminton star Prince Dahal lost his opening match of the Group P to Tokyo 2020 gold medallist and Rio 2016 bronze medallist Viktor Axelson of Denmark.Dahal, who is ranked 172 in the Badminton World Federation’s men’s singles rankings, lost the game 21-8, 21-6 to the Danish world number two at the Porte de la Chapelle Arena in Paris.Dahal, who entered the Paris 2024 on universality spot, will meet Ireland’s 43rd seed Nhat Nguyen on Monday and Israel’s 58th seed Misha Zilberman on Tuesday.A total of 41 players (from 36 countries)—split into 13 groups of three or four—are competing in the men’s singles badminton.

On the one hand, there is international and national excitement over the rising number of tigers, on the other, people are still dying from tiger attacks. The latest tiger census in Nepal conducted in 2022, counted 355 tigers. After people continue to die in tiger attacks in Bardiya and Banke, the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC) has started a behavior change campaign in late 2021 to educate residents of Banke and Bardia national parks, Khata Protected Area, and the surrounding buffer zone. There are 19 youths spearheading the campaign in Bardiya, while nine local youths are involved in Banke. They are training the local residents on how to coexist with tigers and fostering behavior change. Similarly, five youths are leading the campaign in the Khata Protected area of Bardiya. The work and activities of the youth can also be followed on the Facebook page titled 'Behavior Change Campaign'.Behavior change campaigns in Banke and Bardiya serve as important bridges to mitigate the risks posed by tigers to local communities. Since 2021, a youth-led poaching control mobilization campaign has been active in these two districts. Youth who do well in the campaign are also included in the behavior change campaign. One such participant is 35-year-old Kamal Khadka. Khadka, a youth leader of the 'Behavior Change Campaign' started in Bardiya from 2021, educated the people of Auri in ward 8 of Barbardiya Municipality about tigers. Using photos for his lessons, he showed a photograph of a tiger to more than 50 locals, from children to the elderly, gathered in the 'buffer zone' area of Sompur forest in Auri. “Look, our lives are intertwined with the forest. We cannot survive without it. These tigers and other wild animals are not like us. They don't change their ways. So we need to change our daily activities. Rather than confronting these animals, we should learn to coexist. We need to change our behavior accordingly,” he told them.Umesh Paudel, assistant natural resource conservator of NTNC's Bardiya National Park, says that the reason for starting the behavior change campaign is to prevent tiger attacks. “If you look at the statistics, the number of deaths due to tiger attacks increased in 2019 (post-Covid) in Banke and Bardiya. That year nine people died and three were injured. In 2020, six people died and eight were injured. In 2021, thirteen people died and one person was injured. What this indicates is that locals who had gone elsewhere or abroad for work returned home during the Covid pandemic. And more people entered the forest, leading to a rise in tiger attacks and deaths and injuries,” he said.Paudel believes that the behavior change campaign, supported by local youths, has been effective in mitigating human-wildlife conflicts. Over the past four years, hundreds of locals have been trained on how to coexist with tigers and other animals. In 2022, nine people died and 14 were injured in tiger attacks. In 2023, five people died, and this number dropped to just one in 2024.Paudel said, “It is not that the number of deaths due to tiger attacks has stopped completely, but the behavior change campaign has proven effective in reducing incidents. It educates people living in and around Banke and Bardiya on how to avoid tiger attacks, safely enter the forest, and respond if they encounter a tiger.” If we look at the data of the last six fiscal years, tiger attacks have killed 68 people nationwide. According to the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, 10 people were killed by tiger attacks in the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, 12 people died in 2022-23; 21 in 2021-22; 13 in 2020-21; eight in 2019-20; and four in 2018-19.“With the increase in the number of deaths due to tiger attacks, managing the situation has become a major challenge. The statistics are alarming, but efforts are being made to reduce incidents by raising awareness in Banke and Bardiya areas,” says Ajit Tumbahanphe, conservation officer in the Bardiya conservation program. “The behavior change campaign is proving very effective. The campaign was launched post Covid to ensure that tigers and humans can coexist, and so far more than 10,000 local residents have benefited from it,” he added. After Khadka's interaction with the locals, 76-year-old Pradeep Kumar KC remarked that such a programme has greatly benefited the communities. He said educating the younger generation alongside will help prevent future incidents. “We have a habit of going to the forest alone, not exercising restraint when entering the forest, and doing things on our own accord. This interaction has taught us how we can coexist with animals, including tigers, in the forest.” Sita Rani, who is also a tiger-attack victim, is one of the participants in the campaign. A tiger killed her two goats. After the interaction, she said, “Now I know what to do when I go to the forest or see a tiger.” Member-Secretary of NTNC Naresh Subedi believes that the conflict between tigers and humans can be reduced if the necessary and preferred prey species for tigers are available in reserves and parks. This, he claims, will significantly reduce tiger-human conflicts. “Our plan is to implement science-based conservation in Nepal.” “The conflict between tigers and humans is how to change it into coexistence,” Subedi said. The National Trust for Nature Conservation helps in managing potentially problematic tigers through a proactive monitoring system.’ END  \nA new bird species has been spotted in Nepal. A Spotted Flycatcher (Muscicapa striata) was discovered at an altitude of 3,650 meters in Upper Mustang on July 12.Wildlife photographer Sanjay Tha Shrestha and nature guide Shankar Tiwari first sighted the bird and reported it to ornithologists with photographs. A team of national and international ornithologists confirmed that the bird is a new species for Nepal, according to Hathan Chaudhary, president of the Nepalese Ornithological Union.Shrestha and Tiwari spotted the bird at 8:58 am on July 12 near Lo Manthang in the Annapurna Conservation Area, Mustang district. They provided detailed information and photographs of the new bird to the Nepal Bird Record Committee, which tracks new bird species in Nepal. After consulting with the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and both national and international bird experts, the committee concluded that the bird is a new species for Nepal, according to committee chair Tulsi Subedi.The committee has named the bird ‘Taludharse Arjunak’ in Nepali, based on its English name, Spotted Flycatcher. This name was chosen due to the distinctive head markings that make it easier to identify. With this addition, the total number of bird species recorded in Nepal has now reached 996.The Spotted Flycatcher is a migratory species. This bird is found in Mongolia, China, Afghanistan, and Pakistan and regularly migrates to the south during the winter.Wildlife photographer Shrestha expressed satisfaction at identifying a new bird. “This has added enthusiasm for bird tourism,” Shrestha said. \nThe Nepali political class is by and large considered immune to public criticism. Even as the amount of flak they face mounts by the day, they appear determined to continue on their own merry way. Otherwise, how can they justify appointing certified criminals and gangsters as ministers? Or picking someone charged with sexual exploitation to a top constitutional post? And how does the public trust a government packed with such tainted figures? In the latest instance of shamelessness, Nepali Congress has picked Badshah Kurmi, someone who is being investigated in a grave crime of the disappearance of a woman, as a minister in Lumbini province. This, just a month after protestors asking for justice signed a five-point deal with the erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, whereby the government promised to investigate Nirmala Kurmi’s mysterious 2010 disappearance and Badshah’s supposed hand in it. An earlier government committee formed to look into the matter had recommended that eight people, including Badshah, be apprehended and investigated in the case. The seven others were arrested, but not Badshah. Over in Gandaki province, Rajeev Gurung who is better known as Deepak Manange, a gangster who has been repeatedly jailed, is the minister for physical infrastructure, in what is his fourth stint as a provincial minister. On Saturday, a photo of Manange seated at his office chair in a vest went viral online. Reportedly, he had gathered his friends there, where they proceeded to drink till midnight. Likewise, Saroj Thapa, another person who is being investigated for human trafficking, has been made a minister in Lumbini province. Then, over in Bagmati province, Min Krishna Maharjan, a gun-loving thug, has been given the post of the minister for sports. The country’s two biggest political parties are now in power together, promising political stability and clean governance. Yet neither the Nepali Congress nor the CPN-UML seems much interested in controlling the criminalisation of politics. In fact, they are encouraging it. The two parties have nearly two-thirds majority in the federal lower house and hold the keys to all seven provincial governments as well. But even as their power grows, their sense of responsibility towards the society seems to be diminishing.Again, the country’s two biggest and best established political parties are openly promoting criminals and gangsters. Criminals of all persuasions in Nepal are known to join politics just to evade arrest. Not only do they ward off arrest, they even get lucrative positions. The country’s politics has become a pure numbers game, where getting to power is worth any cost. Our current prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, once said that criminals should get to shed their tainted past and serve the people by joining politics. He has over the years cultivated more than a handful of goons in his party. Oli’s current main partner-in-crime in the government, Sher Bahadur Deuba, has also over the years been tone-deaf to the criticism of his generosity towards politicians of baser characters. It is thanks to an attitude like this that people see the whole political class as a crime syndicate. Is the self-image of our mananiyas and ministers that of protectors and promoters of criminals, people wonder.  \nPolitical news from Nepal often feels like a glitch in the matrix: A repetitive play of events from 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. One could blindly pick newspapers from old archives, and the chances of events reading eerily similar to today’s political ‘developments’ are very high.Even politicians admit their abject failure to deliver, yet they are accountable to the same old ways. Voters are stuck between old parties that are different only in name and upstart smaller parties yet to prove their value. As Janan Ganesh put it in his brilliant article in the Financial Times, every country is seeing its own version of the “doom loop of modern politics.” There is a consensus that politicians are generally untrustworthy. Hence, people with strong competence or prospects in other fields avoid jumping into this muck for fear of sullying their names for uncertain outcomes. This leaves the field open to family members and princelings of the old guard—and others with fewer prospects elsewhere.With ‘professional’ politicians crowding this space, public service has become the first casualty. Governance has suffered, and groups with narrow individual interests disproportionately influence policy formulation. In an increasingly complex world where results are expected almost in real-time and with high frequency, failure to deliver feeds another cycle of cynicism among voters. This further discourages ‘good and competent’ people from jumping into the fray.Those entering Nepali politics, until now, have primarily been people who claim some sort of sacrifice made during democratic or republican movements. While this is not to belittle their hard work and sacrifice, it can no longer be the only criterion for seeking party positions or tickets. With internal democracy so weak among all parties, there is no scope for professionals from other fields to provide public service through politics. Our traditional political class is so scared of new entrants that they have erected many restrictive structures within the old parties, making it difficult for fresh joiners to succeed. This leads many to eventually quit or join others. Swarnim Wagle is one of many examples of how this restrictive political system plays out.This issue is equally prevalent in the civil service. Instead of opening up provisions for lateral hiring to infuse fresh talent, every effort is made to keep the bureaucracy incompetent and pliant. The traditional parties have not made any serious efforts to reform the bureaucracy, a topic that deserves a separate discussion.The only route available now is newer disruptive parties winning elections. The competition would help internal party politics as it would put pressure on choosing good candidates and may ultimately lead to party primaries that empower voters to choose who will be on the party ballot. This would help strengthen Nepali democracy.The recent uncharacteristic joining of hands by the Nepali Congress and the Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML)—equivalent to US Republicans and Democrats uniting—to form the government is largely a response to the pressure being felt by the old guards. When this experiment fails and voters punish one or both parties for ditching the fictitious ideological line, the party leadership will be forced to adopt more measures that could, by default, strengthen internal democracy. The hope is that this will create an enabling internal ecosystem within the old parties for young and comparatively more competent leaders to assert themselves. It is depressing to see that the young “Turks” who weren’t once afraid to challenge the monarch from the streets during royal rule have been forced to cower in silence, or worse, to defend the shenanigans of their party leadership.Silver liningNot everything is doom and gloom. The recent success of upstart parties like the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Janamat Party and the Nagarik Unmukti Party, as well as independent mayors like Balendra Shah, Harka Sampang and Gopal Hamal, is a testament to changing voting behaviour. There is much more willingness to break out of the mould and vote for hope. In traditional party strongholds, voters are voting in refreshing patterns. Even party cadres seem much more willing to vote against their candidates if they think those from rival parties would be better for their local area. Take, for instance, anecdotal evidence from Bharatpur and Damak mayoral vote counts in the last election. In Damak, out of the 10 wards, the UML won seven ward chair positions yet lost to the Rastriya Prajatantra Party in the mayoral election. The RPP only won one ward chair position. The story is similar in Bharatpur. The Maoists only won three ward chair positions out of 29, and in most of the wards, the party was not even a distant third in the vote tally, yet Renu Dahal won by a wide margin to be the mayor. Voters were clearly rewarding Renu for her delivery. Her father, being the prime minister, may have helped, but that is beside the point.We must encourage and support this disruption in politics. Political pundits should stop being cynical about the early lacklustre performance, occasional bad apples and missteps of the new parties barely two years into the process. Ultimately, Nepal needs much more direct democracy, not less, which means more choices for the voters. The old guards, who benefit from the current process that gives them a stranglehold over government formation and party selections, are making a last-ditch effort to maintain the status quo. It is a tragedy that traditional opinion makers and gatekeepers fail to recognise this misdirection and continue to be swayed by the knee-jerk reactions of the old guard.Political communication takes place very differently in this social media age. Mainstream media’s failure to reimagine its role only reinforces mistrust of institutions, feeding a frenzy within self-perpetuating social media echo chambers and further eroding trust in the democratic system. \nCompared to other countries in the world, Nepal is neither small nor devoid of the huge potential of being strong. Among the four state elements—sovereignty, territory, population and government—Nepal fares well in three but governance. Its strength lies in its capacity to endure overbearing upheavals that occasionally occur. Since the Anglo-Nepal War (1814-15), which led to the signing of the Sugauli Treaty, Nepal has not compromised its territory. This has been possible through timely, realistic foreign policy within the parameters of bilateral treaties with India and China. Such trends continue even today, despite the extension and diversification of policies. Popular movements have overthrown regimes ranging from Rana autocracy to monarchy; power has transferred smoothly from traditional monarchy to republic. The Nepali state thus remains unruffled by the general belief that monarchy and Nepal’s existence were coterminous or that one could not survive without the other. The Nepal Army, considered the mainstay of power and had served the Ranas and the Shahs, changed its status by supporting the new democratic republic. The Nepali state did not realise any threat to its existence during the 10-year-long Maoist insurgency or later in the wake of instabilities triggered by political parties. But it must be admitted that political parties have acted in unison while facing major political crises or defending the cause of democracy. They steadfastly proclaimed the republican constitution in 2015, resisting outside pressure to defer its announcement to make it more inclusive by addressing the demands of Madhesh parties. Nevertheless, a common feeling is that major political parties have failed to deliver on the minimum aspirations of the public as they are excessively indulged in petty personal and party interests. As a result, the governance crisis, fraught with dangers to other state elements, persists. Since sovereignty and fixed territory are the major elements, the Nepali state has a solid border stretching from the Mechi River in the east to the Mahakali River in the west, Tibet (China) to the north and India to the south (on three sides). Nepal has maintained a fixed boundary with its neighbours for over 200 years. It is highly unlikely that the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity will be jeopardised in the future because of geopolitical limitations that prevent us from being cavalier in handling foreign policy. Moreover, strategic autonomy, often used as a cliché in international relations, is a relative term employed only when allowed to do so in the given political context. All powers, big or small, strong or weak, have limitations and cannot always independently act as they want. The United States, China, Russia, or any other power cannot impose their respective decisions in the face of counter-actions to be undertaken by other hostile powers. For instance, the Russian invasion of Ukraine or China’s restraint on taking strong action against Taiwan, despite displaying aggressive postures, are some examples of limited autonomy of powers. Russia is badly entangled in its invasion of Ukraine, as the Western powers and a few others have not only condemned the Russian aggression but also taken countermeasures to foil its mission. The sovereignty of the state can be preserved only by relying more on prudent domestic and foreign policy, not on arming the state to the teeth. It is particularly so in Nepal’s context, whose very location does not allow it to be indifferent to the sensitivities of its neighbours, China and India. Such limitations have helped maintain Nepal’s long civilisational tradition and history of an independent sovereign nation-state. Fixed territory, recognition of independence and sovereignty buttressed by sound external policy are the country’s strengths. Recurring issues of minor territorial disputes with neighbours do not amount to the loss of settled international borders. Interestingly, in Jhapa, there are two places, Satighatta and Kechana Kawal, where Nepal’s border extends across the Mechi River, creating enclaves like those found in other countries. Surprisingly, no territorial disputes concerning these enclaves have arisen between Nepal and India, but the grudges of local Nepali citizens for being ignored by the state haunt the rulers. People who constitute an element of the state can be described according to the nature of the regime. In traditional monarchical regimes, as were prevalent in many countries of the world, people were/are treated as raiti or praja (subject), having no freedom of expression against the rulers. In such regimes, subject political culture prevails, thus forcing the people to be indoctrinated accordingly. Contrarily, in a democracy, people participate in the political process, which makes the government responsible for them. Popular legitimacy is, therefore, the essence of democratic governance. When such legitimate rights are denied, people revolt against the regimes, as happened in Nepal in 1990 and 2006. Legitimacy has different dimensions that transcend economic, political, social and international. It can be broadly called performance legitimacy, which is concerned with governability. If the system fails to cater to the minimum needs of the general public or fails to reduce socio-economic disparities, then the system begins to face mounting challenges that sometimes turn into rebellion. So, governance and legitimacy are inextricably linked. Today, liberal democracies or authoritarian regimes with limited pluralism seem to confront the crises of performance legitimacy and are increasingly becoming vulnerable to uncertain developments. Nepal’s social structure is solid, as the people live in peace and harmony amid socio-political degradation and despair. Social scientists prefer to call such a matrix as syncretic and synthetic. Religious bigotries are little known to Nepalis. Nevertheless, since the primacy of politics is well accepted, political parties have invariably failed to set an example by demonstrating their governability. Yet, Nepal’s exercises are not as alarming as many pundits tend to present. The country has been able to manage crises that creep into the body politic. The elected leaders are expected to be more sensible in consolidating the gains of the new democratic order. \nWe often hear about the importance of the human microbiome—the vast collection of bacteria and fungi that live on and inside us—when it comes to our health. But there’s another, equally important part of this microbial community that remains far less known: the virome.The virome consists of all the viruses that inhabit our bodies. This includes those that infect humans cells, bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and the viruses we aquire from our diet and environment. Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, with an estimated 10³¹ viral particles globally and about 10¹³ in each human being. For centuries, viruses have been seen mainly as causes of disease. But research suggests that viruses influence our health in important ways.Bacteriophages, for instance, play a crucial role in regulating the bacterial populations in our gut. By keeping harmful bacteria in check, they help prevent conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and obesity.Certain bacteriophages can also enhance the immune system’s ability to combat bacterial infections. They do this by breaking down the outer membranes of harmful bacteria—releasing antigens that stimulate immune responses.Some viruses that interact directly with our immune system even help maintain its balance—potentially protecting us from illnesses. For instance, herpesvirus, which causes cold sores and mononucleosis (mono), can alter immune responses. It does this in many ways—such as by promoting the production of specialised immune cells, altering the gene expression of cells and even suppressing anti-inflammatory responses. These changes may potentially reduce risk of developing secondary infections and allergic responses later in life.Conversely, some viruses might contribute to chronic inflammation by persistently activating immune pathways. The balance of these interactions is critical. A healthy virome helps fend off infections and support overall health. But an imbalanced virome may contribute to poor health and disease.Recent discoveriesThe field of virome research has advanced rapidly thanks to innovations in DNA sequencing. Techniques like shotgun sequencing allow scientists to analyse entire viral communities. This has revealed a wealth of previously unknown viruses and deepening our understanding of their roles in health and disease.Improved methods for isolating viral particles have also made it possible to analyse samples. Bioinformatics tools and databases, such as ViromeQC and the Gut Virome Database, may further support the identification and classification of viral sequences—making it easier to explore these complex communities.These innovations also mean researchers better understand the complexity of the virome and its role in human health.For example, research published earlier this year which tracked infants and their mothers found significant differences in their viromes. This indicates that an infant’s virome is shaped by factors such as diet and environment, rather than being inherited from the mother.Another study showed that newborns typically have no detectable virome at birth, but quickly acquire a diverse array of viruses, mainly bacteriophages, shortly after birth. These viruses are probably picked up from their environment, diet and the people they’re in close contact with.Alterations in the virome have been linked to various diseases, as well. For instance, changes in gut viral populations have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Patients with IBD often have higher levels of certain bacteriophages, suggesting these viruses may play a role in the disease’s development.Understanding the virome could revolutionise medicine and public health. One exciting possibility is phage therapy, where bacteriophages are used to target and destroy harmful bacteria. This approach could offer a powerful tool against antibiotic-resistant infections. Identifying specific virome changes could also lead to new diagnostic markers for diseases—possibly enabling earlier and more accurate interventions.The virome’s interaction with the immune system could hold promise for new vaccines and immune therapies, as well. By studying how certain viruses modulate immune responses, scientists could develop vaccines that better protect against infections.Personalised medicine could also benefit from virome research. Since each person’s virome is unique, treatments tailored to a person’s unique viral composition could enhance the effectiveness of therapies for a range of conditions, from gastrointestinal disorders to autoimmune diseases.The virome represents an exciting new frontier in our understanding of human health. As research continues to unveil the intricate interactions between viruses and their hosts, we can expect significant advances in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases.Read the original article here.-The Conversation \nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has won a third term with 51% of the vote, the country’s electoral authority said just after midnight on Monday, despite multiple exit polls which pointed to an opposition win.The authority said opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez won 44% of the vote, though the opposition had earlier said it had “reasons to celebrate” and asked supporters to continue monitoring vote counts.“The results cannot be hidden. The country has peacefully chosen a change,” Gonzalez said in a post on X at around 11 p.m. local time, before the results were announced.Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado reiterated a call for the country’s military to uphold the results of the vote.“A message for the military. The people of Venezuela have spoken: they don’t want Maduro,” she said earlier on X. “It is time to put yourselves on the right side of history. You have a chance and it’s now.”Venezuela’s military has always supported Maduro, a 61-year-old former bus driver and foreign minister, and there have been no public signs that leaders of the armed forces are breaking from the government.A poll from Edison Research, known for its polling of U.S. elections, had predicted in an exit poll that Gonzalez would win 65% of the vote, while Maduro would win 31%.Local firm Meganalisis predicted a 65% vote for Gonzalez and just under 14% for Maduro.About 80% of ballot boxes have been counted, said national electoral council (CNE) president Elvis Amoroso in a televised statement, adding results had been delayed because of an “aggression” against the electoral data transmission system. \nIsrael’s security cabinet on Sunday authorised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to decide on the “manner and timing” of a response to a rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 teenagers and children, and which Israel and the United States blamed on Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.Hezbollah denied responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams on Saturday, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since Palestinian militant group Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault sparked the war in Gaza. That conflict has spread to several fronts and risks spilling into a wider regional conflict.Israel has vowed retaliation against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Israeli jets hit targets in southern Lebanon during the day on Sunday.But there were expectations a stronger response could follow the security cabinet meeting convened by Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.After the meeting ended, Netanyahu’s office said the cabinet “authorized the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister to decide on the manner and timing of the response.”The White House on Sunday also blamed Hezbollah for the Majdal Shams strike. “This attack was conducted by Lebanese Hezbollah. It was their rocket, and launched from an area they control,” it said in a statement. US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said through her national security adviser that her “support for Israel’s security is ironclad,”The US said Washington has been in discussions with Israeli and Lebanese counterparts since Saturday’s “horrific” attack and that it was working on a diplomatic solution. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington did not want further escalation of the conflict, which has seen daily exchanges of fire between the Israeli military and Hezbollah along the border.Britain expressed concern at further escalation while Egypt said the attack could spill “into a comprehensive regional war.”On the ground, thousands of people gathered for funerals in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.Members of the Druze faith, which is related to Islam, Christianity and Judaism, make up more than half the 40,000-strong population of the Golan Heights. Large crowds of mourners, many in traditional high white and red Druze headwear, surrounded the caskets as they were carried through the village.“A heavy tragedy, a dark day has come to Majdal Shams,” said Dolan Abu Saleh, head of the Majdal Shams local council, in comments broadcast on Israeli television.Hezbollah initially announced it fired rockets at Israeli military sites in the Golan Heights, but said it had “absolutely nothing” to do with the attack on Majdal Shams.Israel says rocket Iranian-madeHowever, Israel said the rocket was an Iranian-made missile fired from an area north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon, placing the blame squarely on Iranian-backed Hezbollah.It was not immediately clear if the children and teenagers killed were Israeli citizens.“The rocket that murdered our boys and girls was an Iranian rocket and Hezbollah is the only terror organization which has those in its arsenal,” Israel’s foreign ministry said.Two security sources told Reuters that Hezbollah was on high alert and had cleared some key sites in both Lebanon’s south and the eastern Bekaa Valley in case of an Israeli attack.Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines said it was delaying the arrival of some flights from Sunday night to Monday morning, without stating why.Israeli forces have been exchanging fire for months with Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon, but both sides have appeared to be avoiding an escalation that could lead to all-out war, potentially dragging in other powers including the United States and Iran.However, Saturday’s strike threatened to tip the standoff into a more dangerous phase. United Nations officials urged maximum restraint from both sides, warning that escalation could “engulf the entire region in a catastrophe beyond belief.”Lebanon has asked the U.S to urge restraint by Israel, Lebanon’s foreign minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, told Reuters. Bou Habib said the US had asked Lebanon’s government to pass on a message to Hezbollah to show restraint as well.All-out war fearedIran’s foreign ministry warned Israel on Sunday against what it called any new adventure in Lebanon.Syria’s foreign ministry said it held Israel “fully responsible for this dangerous escalation in the region” and said its accusations against Hezbollah were false.The conflict has forced tens of thousands of people in both Lebanon and Israel to leave their homes. Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists.Hezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East and opened a second front against Israel shortly after Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on Israel.Druze communities live on both sides of the line between southern Lebanon and northern Israel as well as in the Golan Heights and Syria. While some serve in the Israeli military and identify with Israel, many feel marginalized in Israel and some also reject Israeli citizenship. \nOn Monday, the weather will be partly to generally cloudy across the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is expected in a few areas of Madhesh Province and in some parts of the remaining provinces, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Tonight, the country will be generally cloudy. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely in various locations. There is a chance of heavy rainfall in a few areas of Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki, with heavy to very heavy rainfall possible in one or two places in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki.Currently, the entire country is under the influence of monsoon winds, with the monsoon trough positioned near its average location.On Sunday, the maximum temperature was 36.9°C in Bhairahawa, and the minimum temperature was 15°C in Jomsom. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli took a briefing from secretaries of all the ministries on Sunday. After being appointed the prime minister on July 15, Oli convened his first meeting with the secretaries to learn about their ministries, in the presence of ministers.Officials from the National Planning Commission and heads of the security agencies also attended the meeting.The secretaries updated Oli on the situation and functioning of their respective ministries, said Pradip Yadav, the minister for water supply and sanitation.“Every secretary spoke for around 10 to 15 minutes, informing the prime minister about the problems facing the ministries and their future plans,” Yadav told the Post. “The secretaries of developmental ministries [such as the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport] stressed the need for sufficient budget and difficulties in the procurement process while some called for bringing laws up to date with the constitution.”The secretaries complained about the cumbersome procurement process. The agriculture secretary raised the problem of chemical fertilisers, Minister Yadav said.The two secretaries who participated in the discussion with the prime minister told the Post, requesting anonymity, that they now await a set of instructions from the prime minister.They, however, added that there is no dearth of such instructions from the head of government. “What the bureaucracy needs instead is confidence and favourable work conditions,” a secretary told the Post on the condition of anonymity.“There is a situation in which our friends [civil servants] have to face corruption cases just for working as instructed by the ministers,” the secretaries told the Post. “There is no such ministry at present to which the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has not issued a letter of inquiry.”The government mostly fails to provide chemical fertilisers to farmers when they need it for paddy plantation. The agriculture secretary said that the ministry had failed to supply the farm inputs due to procurement hassles.The secretary at the water supply ministry, headed by Yadav, drew the prime minister’s attention to the fast depleting aquifer as an impact of climate change. “Underground water has dried up in many parts of Madhesh Province and the people there are facing a lack of drinking water,” Yadav said. Minister Yadav said that after studying the secretaries’ statements, the prime minister will issue instructions on Tuesday. Then, the government will plan the work for the current fiscal year accordingly.All the ministers, except for Minister for Information and Communication Prithvi Subba Gurung and Minister for Youths and Sports Tejulal Chaudhary, were present during the briefing. Chaudhary has gone to France for the Olympic ceremony while Gurung had another event to attend. \nThe juvenile correction centres in the country have failed to serve their purposes, study reports say.Presenting their reports to the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives on Sunday, three sub-panels stated that the juvenile correction centres are overcrowded, they lack basic amenities and have safety issues. The three subcommittees of the House were deployed to Koshi, Madhesh and Lumbini provinces to study the juvenile correction centres, along with prisons, there.After studying three out of nine correction centres, all the parliamentary subcommittees had similar findings that they lack facilities even for education, health, hygiene, rest, sports and psychological counselling. Similarly, they host inmates more than four times their capacity.Against its capacity for 50 inmates, the juvenile correction centre in Biratnagar has 222. Similarly, 117 inmates have been crammed into the lBirgunj-based correction centre while it has the capacity for just 17. In Banke, 240 juvenile delinquents are housed in a centre with the maximum holding capacity for 190.\"The situation of the child correction centres is worrisome. They cannot be called correction centres,\" said Gopa Labh Sapkota, who led the study team for Birgunj.The House committee decided to carry out on-site inspection of the correction centres following one after another incident of violence there.On July 9, at least 60 inmates fled the Jayandu Juvenile Correction Centre in Duduwa Rural Municipality of Banke district following a violent clash among themselves. The police managed to capture all but two absconders who are believed to have crossed over to India.That was the third incident of violence in the correction centre within a year. One minor lost his life while 11 others were injured after clashes among the inmates in September last year. In another incident, a few inmates were injured following violent fights in August. As many as 275 juvenile delinquents are housed there.On August 21 last year, 297 juvenile inmates at the Underprivileged Children’s Educational Programmes in Bhaktapur clashed with security personnel, leaving 20 police officials and 15 juvenile inmates injured. The juvenile delinquents clashed with the police after one of the minors died under mysterious circumstances.They not only clashed with the Nepal Police and Armed Police Force personnel but as many as 221 fled the centre, breaching its gate and compound wall. Three weeks later, on September 12, inmates from a juvenile centre in Birta of Birgunj Metropolitan City clashed among themselves.A group of inmates transferred from the juvenile centre in Sanothimi, Bhaktapur had physically assaulted their leader. Some minors from Bhaktapur were transferred to Birgunj after the clash that injured 20 security personnel and 15 juvenile inmates.Juvenile centres house children below 18 years who are convicted or are kept in custody for their involvement in crimes.Appearing before the House committee on Sunday, Ramesh Lekhak, the minister for home affairs, said the government was well aware of the problems in the juvenile correction centres. \"We will pay proper attention to improve the situation,\" he said.A juvenile delinquent is a person under the age of 18 who commits an act that otherwise would have been charged as a crime if s/he was an adult. The minors, who commit a crime punishable by law, are kept in correction homes instead of being sent to a jail after court verdict, as per the existing law.Those who cross 18 years of age before completing their jail terms too are kept in correction homes with the minors until they serve the set term. The study reports have blamed the inmates who are above 18 for the violence. Over two thirds of the inmates in the centres have crossed the 18 years of age. Those stepping into adulthood were found to have been involved in attacking their juniors, said the report from Banke. The country has eight juvenile correction centres—in Bhaktapur, Morang, Kaski, Makwanpur, Parsa, Rupandehi, Banke and Doti. These centres, tasked with bringing about changes in the attitudes and behaviour of the children who commit crimes, must follow specific criteria. Delinquents in their mid-20's too are found to be doing their time at the centres. All the study teams have unanimously recommended their relocation. \nThere is a saying about Nepal’s aviation industry: Every new tourism minister is greeted by at least one crash. This is because the industry is beset by deep-rooted corruption and mismanagement as the country builds airports worth billions of rupees but fails to attract flights. Improving safety remains a far cry.On different occasions, global aviation watchdogs have voiced serious concerns about the capability of Nepal’s civil aviation authority to oversee safety issues.In the past year and a half, more than 100 people have lost their lives in plane crashes—despite air travel being the world’s safest and most regulated industry in the world. Wednesday’s crash is the seventh under Pradip Adhikari, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal who fits into all political systems, and the fourth fatal one of his tenure.Here are a few examples of how policy corruption has paralysed the Nepali aviation industry, the lifeline of the country’s tourism industry and transport in the mountain region. A few years back, a parliamentary sub-committee headed by Madhav Kumar Nepal had ordered the government to immediately split the civil aviation body due to its dual role of doing business and regulating the sector. Nepal, the CPN (Unified Socialist) leader, sent Prem Ale to head the tourism ministry a few months later. Ale stopped the bills from being tabled in the lower house for discussion, although the upper house had passed them.Then, Jeevan Ram Shrestha was appointed tourism minister. On his first day, he announced that he would wait to meet the European Commission’s request to separate Nepal’s civil aviation into regulatory and service-providing organisations.After that, Sudan Kirati was picked as the tourism minister by the Maoist Centre. He took the initiative to register the civil aviation bills in Parliament.Kirati had accused Director General Adhikari of consistently failing to ensure aviation safety, as five aircraft incidents and accidents, including three major disasters, have occurred under Adhikari’s watch.Sources said then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal summoned Kirati and Adhikari and ordered them to work “in tandem”. Kirati then stopped talking about the separation.The issue was then taken up by the parliamentary International Relations and Tourism Committee, which directed Dahal, then prime minister, to table the civil aviation bills in the House of Representatives as soon as possible. The directive was issued in December last year. “The bills have been languishing for a long time. As we doubt the civil aviation ministry will table them in Parliament, we have directed the Prime Minister's Office to do so,” Raj Kishore Yadav, chairman of the committee, had told the Post. A few months later, when the Post approached Yadav to inquire about any progress on the bills, Yadav replied that a split “was not necessary”. The budget for this fiscal year, too, makes no mention of the plan to split the aviation body, after including it in the federal government’s document for three consecutive years.In April, lawmaker and member of the International Relations and Tourism Committee Udaya Shumsher Rana told an interaction that he was informed by a former tourism minister that there is an “invisible” hand preventing the passage of two crucial civil aviation bills. In August 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the United Nations aviation watchdog, formally asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body and ensure a proper regulatory system. However, the Civil Aviation Authority chose to keep the report secret.A former director general said the tourism industry is bearing the repercussions as planes come down each passing year due to a lax regulatory system. “People are dying due to ‘policy corruption.’”On a sunny Wednesday, nineteen people, including two crew members, were on the Saurya Airlines flight to Pokhara. The 50-seater bombardier CRJ 200 with registration mark 9N-AME was flying 15 technicians to the city, where the jet’s heavy maintenance C-check was planned. At 11:11 am, the plane took off from the runway’s southern end (Koteshwar). But just a few seconds after the takeoff, people around the airport heard a loud “bang”. “That was an unusual sound. It was a big bang like a bomb [exploding],” said a top official of a private airline, who was a close witness to the crash.Video footage obtained by the Post shows that the jet rolled and climbed around 80-90ft from the ground. It then tilted towards the right and instantly came down. It hit the ground and burst into flames.The plane then rolled down into a ravine.The cockpit slammed into a cargo container, and it was stuck there, which observers say saved the pilot-in-command, Manish Ratna Shakya, the chief of the operation department at Saurya Airlines.“The pilot survived. He is in stable condition,” said DIG Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for Nepal Police. “It was a miracle.”The fuselage came apart, hit the slope of the tabletop airport, and ricocheted 50 metres away, finally coming to rest on the muddy ground.Eighteen people, including the co-pilot and a foreigner, died. The cockpit and tail were intact.The 21.4-year-old aircraft was inducted into the Saurya Airlines fleet on March 14, 2017.CCTV footage shows that the nature of the crash was similar to last January’s Yeti Airlines crash in Pokhara.Experts suspect many factors, including an engine failure, a bird strike, and poor maintenance.“The investigation will tell the truth,” said Subash Jha, spokesman for Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. This is the second biggest crash inside the Kathmandu airport after the US Bangla, a Dhaka-based airline, accident in March 2018 killed 52 of the 71 passengers aboard. Experts observing the crash closely say that, given the nature of the plane’s fall, the right engine might have stopped working and the aircraft eventually lost the “control panel” mode. This narrow panel, located centrally in front of the pilot, can be used to control heading, speed, altitude, vertical speed, vertical navigation, and lateral navigation.“The aircraft has banked,” said an aircraft engineer. A banked turn (or banking turn) is a turn or change of direction in which the aircraft banks or inclines, usually towards the inside of the turn.“Had it been the left engine, it could have potentially crashed into at least two big planes parked at the tarmac of the airport and the domestic terminal. The impact was huge. The plane just exploded.”One official at the safety department of the civil aviation body suspected a potential bird strike. “What happens when a bird enters an aircraft engine? If an aircraft engine ingests a bird, it can result in engine failure.”“In such a case, if the pilot failed to judge and identify which of the two engines is the problematic one, it could lead to such a situation.”But a senior airline executive countered the argument.“The aircraft has two engines. Even if one engine fails, it would be difficult to climb, but only if it has a full load. The 50-seater plane was carrying just 17 people, a third of its capacity. I don’t believe a bird strike downed the plane.”He, however, suspects poor maintenance. On Wednesday, the plane had taken off after 30 days on the ground.In many cases, a plane stored for several weeks or months could encounter problems if it is flown without a proper inspection. Saurya does not have a hangar in Kathmandu.A civil aviation body official confirmed that the 9N-AME had been on the ground for 30 days.“The engine exploded. Given the nature of the explosion, foreign object damage (FOD) to an aircraft engine can be suspected. FOD happens when a foreign object impacts the engine. Since there are no proper hangers for the storage of its planes in Kathmandu, FOD cannot be ruled out,” said the expert, dismissing the bird strike theory.A senior air safety specialist, who wished not to be named because the investigation is ongoing, said both events—a bird strike and FOD—cannot be ruled out.“Only the flying captain, the lone survivor, and the black box can tell us what exactly happened,” said the air safety specialist. “However, to stop unnecessary rumours, the investigation team should record the captain’s statement and release a preliminary report immediately.”Aviation analyst Hemant Arjyal wrote on the social media platform X: “We do not know what actually happened in today’s crash, but engine seems to be the culprit. And technically, IF a multi-engine aircraft suffers an engine failure during the takeoff roll, THE AIRCRAFT WILL YAW TOWARDS THE FAILED ENGINE.”The airline company has been in a financial crisis for several years. Its financial health deteriorated especially after the Covid pandemic.Last year, it submitted a plan to the civil aviation body to switch to ATR-72-type aircraft and promised to maintain safety standards of the existing fleet until it imported the ATR planes. However, airline officials say they could not secure investment to replace their fleet.However, the civil aviation body overlooked the airline’s financial condition, which is obviously a major safety concern.“With Nepal’s key festival just over two months away, Saurya, which had a total of three aircraft, was planning a full maintenance of the Bombardier that crashed on Wednesday to remain afloat. The Bombardier CRJ200 had 200 engine hours left for full maintenance,” according to insiders. Full maintenance alone does not necessarily ensure full safety of flights.Now the airline is left with just one airworthy plane, and authorities are unlikely to allow the company to operate for the same reason. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli paid a rare visit to the crash site on Wednesday.Saurya Airlines had also laid off staff due to financial problems last year. Despite several attempts, the airline officials could not be reached for comments.According to insiders, poor aircraft maintenance could be one of the potential crash factors, as keeping planes airworthy is costly.Engineers who wrote “fit to fly” too died in the crash.Yet in the immediate aftermath of the crash, there is also a lot of confusion.Another aviation expert ruled out the possibility of poor maintenance. “The entire maintenance team was on the plane. Why would they be on a suicide mission if the plane was ill-maintained?”However, the crash has shed light on different aspects of regulatory failure.It was later found that among the entire maintenance team, two passengers [one child and a woman], the son and wife of a Saurya technician, were flown in the plane cleared for maintenance, which is against the rule.“This suggests the regulator’s negligence,” said Sanjiv Gautam, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. “How can the regulator allow passengers on the ferry flight? That’s sheer negligence.”A ferry flight involves flying an aircraft from one location to another without passengers or cargo, typically for maintenance purposes.Aviation in Nepal is beset with deep-set corruption and mismanagement.The frequent crashes have deterred foreign tourists. Especially high-end tourists have been avoiding travel outside Kathmandu by air because they worry about safety, according to tour operators.Global aviation watchdogs have questioned the civil aviation body’s dual role and urged Nepal to split the organisation into two entities—service provider and regulator—to enhance the safety of flyers.However, successive governments have not shown much interest, although they have spent over Rs 500 million on drafting the civil aviation bills.Following the September 2012 crash of Sita Air Flight 601 in the Manohara river, which killed 19 people, including seven British citizens, the European Commission imposed a blanket ban on Nepali airlines from flying into the 27-nation bloc in December 2013.It’s been 11 years, and the ban has not been lifted as Nepal has failed to address safety deficiencies.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, nearly 950 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955. And just in a year and a half, more than 100 people have perished in air crashes, indicating higher casualties as bigger aircraft are involved in recent accidents.In January 2023, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed in Pokhara, killing all 72 people on board, in the third biggest air accident in terms of casualties. The crash happened two weeks after the inauguration of the China-funded airport.The first big air accident in Nepal happened on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near the Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Before that, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.The government on Wednesday formed a five-member commission headed by Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, former director general of Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, to investigate the crash. \nSeven Nepali athletes will compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics in different events with the goal of securing an official Olympic medal for Nepal.\nNepal's new Cabinet under KP Sharma Oli shows a severe underrepresentation of women (only 9% representation) and Dalits, despite the country's over 50% female population and legal mandates for women's representation.\nDistrict hospitals lack family planning programs due to budget cuts, raising concerns of increased unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and higher maternal and child mortality rates.\nJSP-Nepal and CPN (Unified Socialist) concluded their conventions without fully completing the election process, delaying the appointment of key party officials and central committee members.\nNepalese leader rose to power on a nationalist platform, including territorial disputes with India and a strong anti-India stance.\nIn an interview, Pyakuryal, a PhD holder in Public Affairs, analyzes Nepal's political instability, prevailing narratives, patriarchy's influence, and upcoming trends in Nepali politics.\n\n\nVajra Books and Publications has published the English translation and scientific analysis of the Muluki Ain, first drafted by Janga Bahadur Rana in 1854. This text, a major milestone for the archiving of Nepali historical documents, was translated by Rajan Khatiwoda, Simon Cubelic, and Axel Michaels, a team created in collaboration with Heidelberg University.The first Muluki Ain was considered an important document not only in Nepali but also in South Asian history. It was created to replace sporadic regional law systems of various parts of the country and unify them through a single legal system. Although the text is traditionally accredited to Janga Bahadur Rana, a fact our authors also acknowledge in this translation piece, it was most possibly drafted by a council of prominent lawmakers.The team behind this translated piece is especially dedicated to South Asian legal history. Khatiwoda completed his PhD on the Homicidal Law of 19th-century Nepal, based on various versions of the Muluki Ain. Cubelic, with his PhD in Hindu Legal Scriptures (Dharmashastra), and Michaels, a senior professor at Heidelberg University focusing on South Asian text culture and language, are also experts in this field.The translation brings the various legislatures of 19th-century Nepal to the eye of a larger readership. Some highlights of the Muluki Ain are its highlighting of laws around caste and family systems, purity and sexuality, and punishment systems. These punishment systems also include penalties for acts ranging from stealing, murder and other crimes, to smaller grievances, like punishments for spitting and farting. The text acts as a time capsule for enthusiasts of early Rana history.The authors believe that their text was primarily created to make Nepal’s first written law more accessible to scholars, local and Global, especially those interested in the legal and political systems of South Asia. Khatiwoda adds, “We believe that the book will assist scholars, researchers, and those with interest in related materials to comprehend the immediate social, economic, and political environment of South Asia and Nepal.”Although initially published by Heidelberg University, Vajra Publications has now released the book to make it easily accessible to Nepalese and South Asian audiences. \nAlthough Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) relieved its founding general secretary and spokesperson Mukul Dhakal of all his responsibilities, the party leaders are struggling to pick the new general secretary and spokesperson.The party's central committee meeting, held on July 9, decided to expel Dhakal from all official posts. However, the central committee retained him as a general member considering his contribution to the party since its inception.Leaders said the party took action against him on the recommendation of the disciplinary commission that Dhakal had breached party rules and discipline.Dhakal was punished after he made public his review report that stated the RSP’s popularity had nosedived and that it may face a disaster soon. In the report he submitted to party chief Rabi Lamichhane in June last week, he charged the party leaders with failing to fulfil the promises they made with the general people through Parliament and the government. RSP leaders accused him of making the content of the report public through the media.He prepared the report after touring 38 districts, which the party had assigned in the wake of the Ilam byelections held in April.According to party insiders, some key leaders are in the race for the positions of general secretary and party spokesperson. Top leaders are lobbying to promote the leaders close to them to the major positions. “The way the leaders are engaged in an intense competition within the party for the roles, the issue is unlikely to be resolved soon,” said a leader. “This shows the party might not get a new general secretary and spokesperson immediately.”The party leaders, however, said that while relieving Dhakal from the official position, the party had given him 35 days to respond. With the time yet to pass, the party cannot appoint its general secretary and spokesperson, claimed the leaders.“The party gave Dhakal 35 days to counter its decision,” Manish Jha, the acting spokesperson and RSP lawmaker, told the Post. “It would be unfair to Dhakal if the party appoints new officer bearers before the given time.”But a lawmaker of the party requesting anonymity said that the 35-day timeline was just a technical issue. According to him, the leaders are intensely lobbying for promoting leaders close to them to the twin positions, causing delays.“There are few chances that the party will appoint a new general secretary and spokesperson in the near future,” the RSP lawmaker told the Post. “The party may not be able to appoint anyone to those positions for some time even after the 35-day deadline.”On July 3, following suggestions from the party's disciplinary commission, the RSP central committee suspended Dhakal from the position of general secretary and spokesperson. On the same day, the party also picked Deputy General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti as acting general secretary and Joint Spokesperson Manish Jha as acting spokesperson.Meanwhile, as the party left the government earlier this month, it plans to run some campaigns.A leader says the party leadership intends to hold a closed camp of party members in the near future to rejuvenate party activities.“After getting unseated from the government, our party is currently in a warm-up for the upcoming activities,” Hari Dhakal, a RSP lawmaker, told the Post. “Our party will possibly hold the national conference soon after the closed camp.”As multiple leaders including party chief Lamichhane and deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar, who was also nominated lawmaker from the same party, face various allegations, leaders have raised voices for intra-party investigations.Lamichhane has been accused of being involved in embezzling millions of rupees deposited by common people at multiple cooperatives. A parliamentary special committee is investigating the scam.Deputy Speaker Rana has landed in controversy after a letter written by her requesting the US embassy for interview dates was leaked. She has been blamed for corresponding with a diplomatic agency bypassing Parliament Secretariat and the foreign ministry—that too for individuals not related to the parliament.“The party is forming a panel under the discipline committee to review all allegations against the party,” lawmaker Dhakal told the Post. “It is as per the decision of the central committee meeting on July 25 and not because anyone raised the issue.”Apart from this, the party has also decided to form an 11-member statute amendment recommendation led by the party's acting general secretary, Burlakoti, and to form a panel under the discipline committee to review all allegations against the party, lawmaker Dhakal said.Leaders said they are also planning to organise some demonstrations to mount pressure on the government.Acting general secretary Burlakoti said his party had tried to draw the attention of the prime minister and finance minister to the sluggish development of various infrastructure projects even in the past as well.“Our party President and Vice President held a meeting with the prime minister thrice to urge him to give necessary attention to those projects,” Burlakoti told the Post. “Our party also tried to allocate a sufficient budget for these projects.”Burlakoti claimed that the government fell before the implementation of the budget, so they were unable to provide any tangible result to the public. \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has once again defended Deputy Speaker Indira Rana, who has landed in a controversy over requesting in writing the US Embassy for visa interview dates.The party has accused the ruling parties of trying to scandalise the “trivial” issue with a malafide intention to unseat her.A central committee meeting of the RSP on Thursday concluded that the coalition of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress, which is in minority in the Constitutional Council, wanted to remove Rana and get a lawmaker from their parties to replace her. Besides the roles in the legislature, the Deputy Speaker is also a member of the Council that elects chiefs and members of constitutional bodies and the chief justice.The chief justice, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly chair, the leader of the main opposition in the House and the Deputy Speaker are members of the Constitutional Council, which is headed by the prime minister. The UML, which now leads the coalition government involving the Congress and some fringe parties, has two seats in the Constitutional Council. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and House Speaker Devraj Ghimire are from the second-largest party. (Though a Speaker resigns from all party positions after being appointed to lead the House, s/he hardly is aloof from their party in practice as they mostly rejoin it after the completion of the tenure). The CPN (Maoist Centre) is as strong as the UML in the council. Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as the leader of the opposition, and National Assembly chair Narayan Prasad Dahal are members of the Council.If Deputy Speaker Rana resigns, then the ruling coalition can appoint a lawmaker from one of its components in her position and secure a majority in the Council, even if the chief justice stays neutral in constitutional appointments, RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha said. That the ruling parties had blown the issue out of proportion 18 months after the letter addressed to the embassy made it clear that it was politically motivated, he claimed. Deputy Speaker Rana on February 26 last year wrote a letter to the US Embassy, requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. She faces pressure to quit, after the letter was leaked recently.She requested the embassy to arrange interview dates for six people, including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar, and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter. Rana had written that she wanted the interview dates to be preponed as they were attending the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, scheduled to be held in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023. Experts and retired parliamentary officials criticised her for corresponding with diplomatic agencies without informing the Parliament Secretariat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.After the central committee meeting on Thursday, RSP officials tried to downplay the issue saying that their inquiry had found that the letter hadn’t been registered at the US Embassy in Kathmandu.“The letter has not been registered at the embassy. Nor do we have the evidence of any financial dealings,” said Jha.On July 21, RSP lawmaker Sumana Shrestha, defending Rana in Parliament, said that a media trial was underway to assassinate the character of the Deputy Speaker. Shrestha had said they were ready to leave the post if the ruling parties asked for it. “If you need a seat on the Constitutional Council, ask for it. But a woman’s character should not be assassinated in this manner,” Shrestha had said. After the central committee meeting on Thursday, Jha said allegations against Deputy Speaker Rana were discussed in the central committee.“We challenge the other parties to prove that the letter was registered at the Embassy,” Jha told the Post. “During our informal investigation, we found that no recommendation letter by Rana was registered at the US Embassy.” He added that the letter was dated 18 months ago, and no one was found to have taken any benefits from the recommendation. Her intentions were not wrong, Jha said.Since the deputy Speaker is no longer a member of the party, RSP was not in a position to make any organisational decision related to her, he added.“Complaints against her have been filed to the Parliament Secretariat and the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the legislature. Our party will form an opinion if needed based on the decision they make.” The party meeting also reached a decision to form a panel under the discipline committee to review all allegations the party faces. The meeting decided to form an 11-member statute amendment recommendation committee led by acting RSP General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti. \nThe ruling and opposition parties have started a blame game over Deputy Speaker Indira Rana's move to write a letter to the American Embassy in Kathmandu to allocate convenient visa interview dates for individuals without clear statuses.While some ruling party lawmakers demanded a probe into the matter, opposition lawmakers including those from the Rastriya Swatantra Party said it was a non issue.During the special time in the House of Representatives on Sunday, Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada demanded a committee to probe the correspondence by Rana.\"A letter requesting dates for US visas has been received. Can the Deputy Speaker still command Parliament?\" he asked. \"There is the Parliament Secretariat to facilitate the visa process if anyone of Parliament has to travel abroad. The Deputy Speaker has breached the norm by writing the letter herself.\"He claimed Rana's move had brought shame not just to Parliament but the whole country. \"The Deputy Speaker's Office cannot act as a consultancy to facilitate the visa process,\" he said.On February 26, 2023 she had written to the consular general at the Embassy of the United States in Kathmandu to arrange interview dates for six people including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter.Rana wrote that as they were attending the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York on March 6 to 17, 2023, she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. She is now being criticised for misusing her position to make undiplomatic requests.Deputy Speaker, a constitutional position, is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council that recommends chiefs and members of constitutional bodies and the chief justice.Opposition lawmakers, however, claimed that the issue was blown out of proportion because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. Sumana Shrestha, a Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) lawmaker, said Rana's character was being assassinated because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. The council has two members each from the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), one from the RSP and the next is the chief justice.\"Ask for [Rana's] support, we can give. But can you ruin the character of someone by calling them a human trafficker [because the ruling alliance is in a minority]?\" she asked. \"Character assisination is unacceptable. Let us check how everyone has used their letterheads in the past.”She said there must be the criteria for using the letter. She accused the major parties of resorting to a media trial of the deputy Speaker.Stating that the world knows how a lawmaker behaved in Parliament and on the streets demanding visa for an individual, she said the current criticism was nothing but a planned move against Rana. Gyan Bahadur Shahi, a Rastriya Prajatantra Party lawmaker, had led a mass protest against the US Embassy for denying visa to cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane.Though there can be moral questions for writing the letter, Madhav Sapkota, a CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker, said, the way the letter was brought to the public domain now gives enough room to suspect the motive.\"We condemn the move if it is being done with an aim to bulldoze decisions from the Constitutional Council,\" he said. \"As an opposition party, we will strongly oppose such moves.\" Rana also claims that there have been coordinated attempts to attack her. Issuing a statement on Friday, she said, “The attempt to scandalise the letter I wrote out of compassion, after a year and a half, is nothing but a move orchestrated against me,” reads the letter.“Those who know me well are aware of my nature. I may have many personal shortcomings, and there may be many who try to take advantage of that, but I have never engaged in unethical actions, nor will I ever do.\" Experts in the field say the issue is not as light as Rana is trying to portray.Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, said the deputy Speaker must be held accountable for her act.It would be hasty to conclude that writing the letter was an act of human trafficking, Thapa told the Post. “But it is clearly a misuse of authority.\"Rana must take responsibility for her wrongdoings, he said. Writing for herself was not a problem but including the names of those who are not related to Parliament in any way is problematic, Thapa argued.An official at the secretariat claimed that Rana had tried to get the secretariat to write the letter. That didn't happen as then-general secretary Bharat Raj Gautam didn't agree to it, said the official. \"She wrote the letter herself as the general secretary refused to involve the parliament secretariat in it.\" \nThe constitutional bench of the Supreme Court will hear a writ petition challenging the appointment of CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli as prime minister.A single bench of Justice Bal Krishna Dhakal on Sunday forwarded the case to the constitutional bench, citing the need for a ‘serious constitutional interpretation’.“The matter raised in the writ petition involves serious questions of constitutional interpretation, and its resolution should be done by the constitutional bench. Therefore, present it before the chief justice,” the order states.Advocates Deepak Adhikari, Khagendra Prasad Chapagain and Shailendra Kumar Gupta filed the petition on July 15, seeking a mandamus order to annul the appointment arguing that it was unconstitutional.The petitioners argue that the President should initiate the new government formation under Article 76(3) if a government formed under Article 76(2) fails to secure a vote of confidence.Article 76(2) states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the House, the President appoints as prime minister “a member of the House who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties.”Article 76(3) allows the President to appoint the parliamentary party leader of the largest party as prime minister, subjecting him to a vote of confidence within 30 days. Under the clause, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba would become prime minister as the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House.The Office of the President, the Federal Parliament Secretariat, Nepali Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli, among others, have been named defendants in the petition.President Ramchandra Paudel on July 15 appointed Oli as the prime minister after he staked his claim to the post with the support of 166 lawmakers.The President had made a call as per Article 76(2) of the constitution after Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was appointed under the same article, failed the floor test. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nWomen travellers love staying longer in Gandaki Province, which hosts Pokhara, the world-famous Annapurna Circuit, the ancient forbidden kingdom of Mustang, and the gorgeous Manang village, to name a few tourist attractions, compared to men, it has been found. A special report on the trend of staying and spending of foreign tourists in Gandaki, published by the research unit of the Nepal Rastra Bank’s Pokhara office, shows that female tourists spend an average of 13 days in the province, while male visitors spend 11 days.Mani Raj Lamichhane, director of the Research, Planning, and Monitoring Department of the Nepal Tourism Board, said many factors draw female travellers to Gandaki, and the kinds of activities they engage in make their stay longer than men’s.The trekking routes of Annapurna base camp are a huge draw nowadays, especially for female adventure seekers, Lamichhane added. This destination is affordable, safe, short and easy.There are many tour and hotel operators led by women in Pokhara, which provides a “sense of safety and security” for women trekkers who nowadays go on long treks and enjoy Lake City.In March, Pokhara, a picturesque city nestled in the lap of the Annapurna mountain range, was officially declared Nepal’s tourism capital.Businesses such as discos, nightclubs, and live music venues in Pokhara operate 24/7, providing extended opportunities for entertainment and leisure.Pokhara now has an international airport but has yet to begin commercial operations.While the average number of days tourists spend in Nepal is 13.2, those coming to this part of western Nepal spend an average of 12 days, according to the survey.According to the report, tourists on travel packages spend $89.31 a day, while free independent travellers (FITs) pay $54.32 a day.The average spending of tourists in Gandaki is $62.89 a day.The report said that 76 percent of the visitors to Gandaki are FITs.Most of the spending is on food.Visitors spend 28.22 percent on food, 27.6 percent on accommodation, 21.7 percent on transportation, and 12.3 percent on entertainment.The central bank’s regional office surveyed six of the 11 districts in the province, covering 400 tourists.Age-wise, the average staying period of tourists between 31 and 45 is high, as they spend 14 days in the province.Among the six districts surveyed, Manang has one of the longest stays of 18 days. The shortest stay is in Gorkha district, that is four days.Most tourists described their stay in the province as positive, with 60 percent saying “highly positive” and 34.75 responding “positive”. The survey result showed that tourists had a good experience visiting the province.The survey said 23.11 percent faced problems related to transportation, while 15.34 percent faced payment hassles during travel.Similarly, 12.31 percent of tourists faced language problems, and 6.44 percent needed more tour information.According to the report, 53.12 percent of tourists bought tour packages from a Nepali travel company, while 43.88 percent bought them from international travel agencies. In the study period, tourists from 41 countries visited Gandaki Province. The highest number of travellers came from India, followed by France, the United States, England, and Australia.The survey found that most foreigners come for adventure activities. Besides, 24.03 percent want entertainment, 16.84 percent are interested in culture, 10.18 percent are pilgrims, 5.79 percent have other purposes, and 2.9 percent do business. The survey shows that 68 percent of tourists are first-time visitors, while 32 percent are repeat visitors. Some have visited the province as many as 30 times.The number of tourists travelling alone is 34.75 percent. Similarly, 28 percent of tourists visited with their friends, 22.50 percent with family and 14 percent in groups. \nNepal’s private sector has been sailing in troubled waters. The central bank responded to the problem experienced for the past two fiscal years by easing monetary policy and cutting rates to keep credit flowing. For the first time, the bank has admitted that the country suffered an “economic slowdown” for two consecutive years.The private sector welcomed the monetary policy for the fiscal year 2024–25, unveiled by Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari on Friday. The policy aims to ramp up support for the economy, which has been slowing, said Adhikari. “The policy targets gradual economic recovery by controlling inflation, stabilising interest rates, and ensuring credit demand.”The central bank said monetary policy had transitioned to an “easing, cautious” mode to address the demand of the private sector, which is the driver of economic growth.With easing measures, the central bank expects a double-digit private sector credit growth, increasing by 12.5 percent year-on-year in 2024-25.“The monetary policy is favourable for the private sector. It aims at economic recovery through productive use of private-sector credit,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. “There was a problem. Money had piled up in banks, and businesses were not getting it to invest. The policy has untied the knot.”The central bank said the private sector pumped Rs5.27 trillion into the economy in the last fiscal year, which ended on July 15. This accounts for 92 percent of Nepal’s economy.The growth of the construction sector also stalled in the period. In the last fiscal year, the sector, with a contribution of 5.41 percent to the economy, is projected to have dropped to 2.07 percent. To address the sector’s grievances, the monetary policy has extended the interest payment deadline for contractors to November.“It’s welcoming, though it is late,” said Rabi Singh, president of the Federation of Contractors’ Associations of Nepal. “But this is just a temporary arrangement.”“We had recommended the government for recapitalisation of the loans and interest for 2 to 5 years to stabilise the construction industry’s capital structure,” he said.The government defaulted on payment for contractors, forcing hundreds of projects to halt and eventually cause the construction sector, one of the key economic indicators, to enter a recession. “Still, we need the assurance of enough cash flow for the development of the critical infrastructure, which is also the basis for jobs creation.”Singh said the construction sector has been working on projects amounting to Rs600 billion.The central bank said the measures to cut interest rates are intended to enhance market liquidity and support economic activity in a low-inflation environment. The upper ceiling interest rate corridor has been decreased by 0.5 percentage points to 6.5 percent, and the policy rate has been reduced by 0.5 percent, to 5 percent.According to market analysts, if banks’ interest rates are low, people generally tend to invest. This will allow liquidity injections in the market without it being absorbed by the banks and the central bank.The monetary policy stated that the high liquidity in the banking system would support businesses and individuals and ease the difficulties of the private sector.The central bank said mobilising the banks’ liquidity through the private sector would support the federal government’s ambitious economic growth target. “This monetary policy will help us reach the 6 percent economic growth targeted by the federal government by keeping inflation at around 5 percent,” said Governor Adhikari. He said the central bank would manage liquidity and inject capital into the productive sector to achieve the target growth.According to the annual account estimates by the National Statistics Office, Nepal’s economic growth was estimated at 3.87 percent in the last fiscal year, in an optimistic scenario.The World Bank said in its April Nepal Development Update that economic growth is projected to accelerate to 4.6 percent in the current fiscal year, a way below the government target.“This recovery is largely attributed to the easing of monetary policy, assuming the productive use of private-sector credit,” the multilateral funding agency said. “Private sector credit contracted in the last fiscal year due to the tighter regulation on working capital loans, high lending rates, and weak domestic demand.”“The reforms to improve the business environment could attract more private investment,” according to the World Bank.On Friday, the central bank announced it would review the current working capital loans guideline. Banks and financial institutions offer short-term working capital loans to finance a company’s everyday operations.At present, industrialists and businesspeople get working capital loans of up to 25 percent of their annual turnover.For those taking more working capital loans than the set threshold, the deadline for borrowers to repay the excess credit has been extended to mid-July 2025. The central bank said it aims to maintain seven months of forex reserves to cover goods and services imports in the ongoing fiscal year 2024-25. The central bank said it would coordinate with the government to formulate necessary laws to regulate and supervise savings and credit cooperatives.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has flagged a risk to Nepal’s economy that could trigger social unrest if the ongoing cooperatives problems are not sorted out.It said that several cooperatives have collapsed in the past six months, causing a loss or freezing of client savings and creating small-scale social unrest. The IMF warned that problems in the savings and cooperatives sector are expanding.The leading cause of the failure is investment in illiquid and underperforming cooperatives’ assets, which impact repayment capacity, combined with some cases of fraud.The monetary policy said it would facilitate the government’s initiative to return Rs500,000 to each cooperatives depositor by recovering them from the directors’ properties.With a growing number of companies being blacklisted, the central bank said it had worked out a policy for the companies that are associated with the blacklisted companies but have not committed any offence.Under the policy, if one firm is blacklisted in a joint venture, it will not be mandatory to keep the other in the bad book if it has committed no offence.At present, if a person or organisation that is blacklisted owns 15 percent or more shares in any other firm, personally or institutionally, the director and executive head of such a firm or company can also be blacklisted. The central bank said it would provide collateral-free loans to migrant workers based on the assurance that remittances would be sent to the bank accounts in their home country.The NRB has extended the deadline for loan repayment to microfinance customers who failed to pay loans under various circumstances. Monetary policy has increased the limit on home loans. The bank said that the limit on home loans taken for the first time would be increased to Rs25 million from Rs20 million. It has increased the foreign exchange limit for Demand Draft/Telex Transfer facilities when importing goods to $50,000 from the existing $35,000.The existing limit for importing goods through ‘document against payment’ and ‘document against acceptance’ has been increased from $60,000 to $100,000.The monetary policy has removed the limit on share mortgage loans for institutions, which is currently Rs200 million. However, no new provision has been made on personal or individual loan limits. Currently, the share mortgage loan limit for individuals is Rs150 million, and individual share investors have been demanding an increase in this limit.  \nMG Motor India, in collaboration with JSW Group, is set to introduce an array of new vehicles into the Indian market over the next year, bolstering its presence and product offerings. The announcement comes amidst a strategic push towards electrification and expansion in mass-market and premium segments. Rajiv Chaba, president and managing director of MG Motor India, confirmed the approval for five new models slated for launch by the end of 2025. The upcoming launches include a mix of electric and hybrid vehicles catering to diverse consumer preferences. The highlight of the lineup is the MG Cloud EV, an electric MPV expected to debut in the festive season. Designed on a born-electric platform, the Cloud EV promises a spacious interior and advanced features. MG Motor India announced the Cloud EV launch following the launch of the Bingo EV hatchback, built on the Global Small Electric Vehicle (GSEV) platform, featuring a robust battery performance with up to 333 km range. In Nepal, Paramount Motors, the authorised distributor for MG Motors, is gearing up to launch the MG Cyberster this year. This innovative electric vehicle is poised to redefine the landscape of electric mobility in Nepal, offering unparalleled performance and futuristic design, the company said in a statement. \nThe Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry held a meeting with the newly appointed energy minister Dipak Khadka on Thursday in Singha Durbar, Kathmandu. The delegation, led by NICCI President Shreejana Rana, included Vice President Sunil KC, Treasurer Kunal Kayal, Executive Member Arun KC, Convener of the Energy Committee Batu Lamichhane, Deputy Director Marshal Rathour, and Finance Head Nimesh Nepal. The meeting focused on attracting foreign investments, project development, and capacity enhancement in the energy sector. These are crucial for reducing the country’s trade deficit through energy exports to India and other countries via Indian transmission lines, NICCI said in a statement. On the occasion, KC highlighted several key issues in the energy sector.  He emphasised the need for a joint mechanism involving the private sector, the Nepal Army, and government representatives to facilitate the timely import of explosives, which is crucial for project completion. He urged collaboration with the Indian and Bangladeshi governments to develop transmission lines and organise joint roadshows in India and Bangladesh to attract investments. \nOver the decade, Nepali doctors, categorised as “foreign national residents” in India’s prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), have been deprived of stipends.On June 26, Dr Indra Shekhar Prasad, the president of the Resident Doctors Association (RDA), and Raghunandan Dixit, general secretary of the RDA, wrote to the director of AIIMS and raised the issue of non-payment of stipends to the foreign national residents at AIIMS.“This long-standing grievance demands immediate redressal and your decisive intervention,” the letter said. “The RDA has tirelessly advocated for the rights of these residents, who contribute to AIIMS's mission despite facing this glaring injustice.”Most of the foreign students are from Nepal. Ekata Vyas, who campaigns on behalf of the Nepali students—estimated to number at least 60—told the Post that she is hoping for positive results this time. She has received positive feedback and responses from New Delhi and the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu. The monthly stipend ranges from IRs 90,000 to 1,20,000.Besides taking up the matter, the foreign national doctors, mostly from Nepal, took up the issue before 2011. According to the Nepali doctors who are serving in AIIMS, a case was filed in the Delhi High Court against the discriminatory provision over the stipends and arrears in 2011. The Delhi Court gave its verdict in favour of the students on July 16. In 2013, however, the AIIMS filed a counter case which was made absolute on December 4, 2017, after 27 hearings, most of them just formalities marked by absences on the bench and of defendants. A Nepali student said that since they did not have the time and resources to follow up on the case in court, it was dismissed. “Then, we started discussing the matter with government officials and diplomats,” said the student.During the Nepal visit of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in 2018, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli also took up the matter with the Indian delegation.“Then we came to know that the India prime minister's office directed the Ministry of External Affairs to look into the matter and expedite its resolution. The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu also confirmed to India’s Ministry of External Affairs that Indian students in similar courses are getting stipends equal to their Nepali counterparts from their respective institutions in Nepal. In May 2018, India’s Ministry of External Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs to examine and expedite the prime minister’s directive.Then, India’s health ministry wrote to AIIMS, the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JPIMER), and the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, seeking the details of the foreign national residents.“It is pertinent to note that esteemed institutions such as JIPMER and PGIMER have already rectified similar issues by ensuring stipend payments to their Foreign National Residents as early as 2020. AIIMS, renowned for its commitment to excellence and equity, cannot afford to lag behind in such matters of principle. As representatives of the RDA, we assert that the workload and dedication of Foreign National Residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,” the RDA stated in its letter to the AIIMS director.After two premier health institutions started providing the stipends in April 2020, the Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS wrote to the Prime Minister's Office in India seeking its intervention and solidarity with the foreign national residents who have been deprived of the stipends for the past decade.Again in May of the same year, the AIIMS association wrote to the AIIMS director to recognise the efforts by foreign national residents during the pandemic and consider resuming the stipend, but the request went unheard.In January 2023, the AIIMS issued a public notice stating that the government of Nepal should sponsor these students.Nepal’s foreign ministry then clarified that the Nepali students had competed openly and were selected on merit with no sponsorship or role of the government of Nepal. It directed the Nepali Embassy in New Delhi to look into the matter. “We took up the issue with prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and urged him to raise the matter while meeting with Modi,” said the Nepali doctors. “In September, 2023, the Supreme Court of India issued a verdict in a similar case stating that nonpayment of stipend cannot be justified.”Arguing that it is equivalent to bonded labour, the verdict directed the Medical Council to take note of instances in which the stipend is not paid.The Indian government informed the Supreme Court of India that, as per its directive, action will be taken to ensure that there is parity in medical education. “We again wrote to the foreign minister of Nepal, the Nepali Embassy, and the Indian Embassy to discuss the matter during the bilateral commission meeting scheduled for the first week of January 2024,” a Nepali doctor said.Both foreign minister NP Saud and Nepal’s ambassador Shankar Sharma took up the matter during the seventh joint commission meeting held in Kathmandu, according to the students.Then, several meetings were held, correspondence was made by the resident doctors of AIIMS, and Nepali students submitted applications to the health minister of India, people informed on the matter said.\"RDA asserts that the workload and dedication of foreign national residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,\" said RDA President Dr Inder Shekhar Prasad. \"Denial of their stipends not only undermines their morale but also tarnishes AIIMS's reputation as a beacon of medical education and equality.\"The Nepali doctors said that since India has come up with a new budget, they hope their long struggle for getting stipends will be resolved. \nDrinking water samples collected from the “Drugs-Free Society”, a Thaiba-based rehab hit by a cholera outbreak, have tested positive for faecal coliform.Officials at the Health Office Lalitpur, have reported the presence of the deadly microbes in all water samples including those from the water utility and well water.“Faecal coliform, a deadly microbe, has been detected in all water samples from the cholera-hit rehab,”said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Health Office Lalitpur. “We have started chlorinating the water to tackle the contamination.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. The presence of faecal coliform means that the drinking water being used by locals of Thaiba is contaminated with sewage, according to doctors.At least four people had tested positive for cholera that spread in the Thaiba-based rehab earlier this week.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Of the four infected patients, one in serious condition was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu. Another patient, who was admitted in the same hospital, was discharged on Wednesday, but has not gone home because the rehab has closed and he has nowhere else to go. Faecal coliform had also been detected in the study carried out on water samples collected from Godawari Municipality before the onset of monsoon.As monsoon season is an epidemic season, in which most sources of drinking water get contaminated, presence of deadly microbes—E coli, faecal coliform in drinking water is not unusual during the monsoon season, health officials say. Even jar water, which is widely considered safer compared to water from other sources, gets contaminated during the monsoon season.What concerns them much is the apathy of the responsible agencies in launching awareness drives about the risks and other preventive measures. Most local authorities across the country halted testing of drinking water just before the start of monsoon citing budget constraints.Doctors say this is not the first time that the water used by people in the Valley was found contaminated with potentially deadly microbes. What concerns them more is that water quality has not improved significantly.“Consumption of water contaminated with human faeces causes diarrheal infections,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Whatever the source, one must ensure that water is safe before drinking.”According to Basaula, the number of diarrheal cases has started rising in the hospital, and contaminated water and food are the main culprits. He said there are chances of outbreaks of diarrheal infections in multiple places where water from contaminated sources is being distributed.“Around six diarrheal patients seek treatment in our hospital every day,” said Basaula. “One must be careful about the quality of food and water before consumption.”Doctors say consumption of contaminated water not only causes diarrheal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the chances of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.Initiating awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from water-borne diseases, according to them. A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of infection, they say. \nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has alerted all agencies concerned to the risk of a Nipah virus outbreak in Nepal, as neighbouring India recently reported a death from the deadly disease.Officials said they have purchased reagents to test the virus and laboratory technicians have been trained to test samples of suspected cases.“We are aware of the Nipah virus outbreak in India and the deaths,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, chief of the Zoonotic and Other Communicable Disease Control Section. “We are closely monitoring the development and have alerted our relevant agencies to the looming risk.”India has reported an outbreak of the Nipah virus in the state of Kerala and the death of a 14-year-old boy from the infection on Sunday. An additional 60 people who came in close contact with the deceased have been identified as a high-risk group by local health authorities, according to media reports.This is the fifth outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala since 2018, according to media reports. Last year too, health authorities in India confirmed at least two deaths and three other cases of the viral infection, including a child, in the southern Indian state.Nipah is a zoonotic virus, transmitted from animals to humans, and causes a lethal swelling of the brain in humans. Transmission generally occurs when people come in close contact with infected animals or through the consumption of the meat of infected animals, according to doctors. The World Health Organisation has classified the Nipah virus as a priority pathogen due to its potential to trigger an epidemic.Transmission generally occurs when people come in direct contact with infected animals—pigs, fruit bats or through consumption of contaminated foods and meat of infected animals, according to health officials. Doctors say cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus have also been reported in many places, including in India, among the families and caregivers of the infected people.Health officials said no treatment for the Nipah virus is available. Without a vaccine having been developed, health workers provide symptomatic treatments only. “We have alerted all our sentinel sites across the country to the risks,” said Ojha. “Health workers are requested to send samples of the suspects for lab testing.”Doctors say Nepal is at risk of an outbreak of the Nipah virus, as fruit bats, which are the primary hosts of the virus, might also be present there. The Nipah virus was first detected in 1999 after farmers and others who came in close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore developed severe respiratory problems and inflammation in the brain.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 300 people were diagnosed with the disease then, and more than 100 of them died.Experts said that authorities should take the issue seriously as the virus is far deadlier than the coronavirus, with up to 75 percent death rate in humans. “The virus is much more infectious and deadlier than other respiratory viruses currently in circulation,” Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, told the Post. “Even if the primary hosts of the virus are fruit bats and pigs, this virus is transmitted from human to human through secretion and excretion. The authorities must step up surveillance.”Doctors say that fruit bats from India, which carry the Nipah virus, can easily enter Nepal due to the proximity and similar environments. Moreover, due to the free movement of people between the two countries, there is always a high chance of any disease seen in India entering Nepal.The incubation period of Nipah infection is 4 to 14 days, and its symptoms include fever, headache, convulsions, and respiratory and neurological problems.The World Health Organisation said that although the virus has caused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, it infects a wide range of animals and causes severe disease and death in people, making it a public health concern. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population on Tuesday confirmed a cholera outbreak in Thaiba of Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur district. A patient with severe diarrhoea tested positive for cholera, officials said.“A lab report confirmed cholera in a diarrhoea patient,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesperson of the Health Ministry. “Stool samples of other diarrheal patients have also been collected for testing.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Officials at the Health Office, Lalitpur told the Post that several people have been infected in a suspected cholera outbreak in the “Drug-Free Society”, a Thaiba-based drug rehab centre. Rapid diagnostic tests confirmed that at least four residents have cholera.“Out of six samples tested, four came positive for cholera,” an official at the municipality told the Post on condition of anonymity. “One patient, in serious condition with severe diarrhoea, has been admitted to the intensive care unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital.”All four infected people were referred to Sukraraj hospital on Monday by the local health authority. But three of them fled the hospital on Monday night, according to Health Ministry officials. “Three patients, who tested positive in rapid diagnostic tests, escaped through the window of the hospital’s toilet on Monday night,” said spokesperson Budhathoky. “Another patient, whose condition is serious, is being treated in intensive care at the hospital. The patient, who tested positive for cholera, has been admitted to a cabin in the hospital.” Officials said that patients might have fled the hospital to avoid returning to the rehab.Following news of the suspected cholera outbreak, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, the agency responsible for responding to the disease outbreaks, mobilised a team of health workers to the rehab.“Samples of water and stools have been collected from the rehab centre,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. The Kathmandu Valley often witnesses cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season, with hundreds of people suffering from diarrheal infections that continue for months.In May, a 62-year-old man from Makawanpur district, who had been hospitalised with severe diarrhoea, tested positive for the deadly disease. The man is said to have been living in Kathmandu for a long time.In 2022, a total of 77 cases of cholera were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Experts say that a cholera outbreak in the Valley during the monsoon is particularly concerning. Rainwater contaminates most water sources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected with water-borne diseases, including cholera. Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main drivers of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. According to the World Health Organisation, a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.A combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepalese table tennis player Santoo Shrestha lost to Senegal's Ibrahima Diaw in the Olympics preliminary round, marking Nepal's debut in the sport at the event.\nVenezuelans anticipate Sunday election results amidst concerns about fairness, with the opposition hoping for a victory against the ruling socialist party that has faced economic and political crises.\nVenezuelans vote in crucial election amidst opposition concerns and President Maduro's warnings of violence.\n A rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights killed 12 people including children on Saturday, Israeli authorities said, blaming Hezbollah and vowing to inflict a heavy price on the Iran-backed Lebanese group.Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the strike, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since the start of the conflict in Gaza.The attack sharply escalated tensions in the hostilities which have been fought in parallel to the Gaza war and has raised fears of a full-blown conflict between the heavily armed adversaries.The rocket struck a football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.“Hezbollah will pay a heavy price, the kind it has thus far not paid,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a phone call with the leader of the Druze community in Israel, according to a statement from his office.In a written statement, Hezbollah said: “The Islamic Resistance has absolutely nothing to do with the incident, and categorically denies all false allegations in this regard”.Hezbollah had earlier announced several rocket attacks targeting Israeli military positions.The Israeli ambulance service said 13 more people were wounded by the rocket that hit the soccer pitch which was filled at the time with children and teenagers.“They were playing soccer, they heard sirens they ran to shelter.. it may take them like 15 seconds (to reach the shelter). But they couldn’t reach the shelter because the rocket hit the site between the ground and the shelter,” said Mourhaf Abu Saleh, a witness.Footage posted on social media showed the moment the rocket hit. An air raid siren can be heard, followed by a big explosion and images of smoke rising. Reuters was able to independently verify the location with the buildings and road layout that matched the satellite imagery of the area.Idan Avshalom, a medic with the Magen David Adom ambulance service, said first responders arrived to a scene of great destruction. “There were casualties on the grass and the scene was gruesome,” he said.Netanyahu, already due to head back from the United States to Israel overnight on Saturday, said he would bring his flight forward and convene his security cabinet upon arrival.The United States, which has been leading diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalating the conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border, condemned it as a horrific attack and said U.S. support for Israel’s security was “iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah”.The United States “will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority,” the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement. The Blue Line refers to the frontier between Lebanon and Israel.Iranian missileThe Israeli military said the rocket launch was carried out from an area located north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon.Speaking with reporters at Majdal Shams, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that forensics showed the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq-1.Hezbollah had earlier announced firing a Falaq-1 missile on Saturday, saying it had targeted an Israeli military headquarters.In a televised statement, Hagari also said that for now there was no change in Home Front Command instructions, indicating the army was not expecting imminent escalation across Israel.Netanyahu’s far-right coalition ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, called for tough retaliation, including against Hezbollah’s leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.“For the death of children, Nasrallah should pay with his head. All of Lebanon should pay,” Smotrich posted on X.The conflict has forced tens of thousands of people in both Lebanon and Israel to leave their homes. Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists.The Israeli military said after Saturday’s attack the death toll among civilians killed in Hezbollah attacks had risen to 23 since October, along with at least 17 soldiers.Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the UNIFIL peacekeeping force which operates in southern Lebanon, told Reuters its force commander was in contact with authorities in both Lebanon and Israel “to understand the details of the Majdal Shams incident and to maintain calm”.A senior diplomat focused on Lebanon said all efforts were now needed to avoid an all-out war.Attacks from LebanonHezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East that have entered the fray in support of their Palestinian ally Hamas since October.Iraqi groups and the Houthis of Yemen have both fired at Israel. Hamas has also carried out rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon, as has the Lebanese Sunni group, the Jama’a Islamiya.More than 40,000 people live on the Israeli-occupied Golan, more than half of them Druze residents. The Druze are an Arab minority who practice an offshoot of Islam.The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building.At least 30 rockets were then fired from Lebanon across the border, the military said.Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks. \nJuddha Shumsher's zoo, initially a private space for his family, contained a wide range of animals, including elephants, horses, deer, monkeys, tigers, rhinos, leopards, red pandas, bears, palm civets, four-horned antelopes, Himalayan gorals, pheasants, Himalayan monals, gharial crocodiles, porcupines, and even lions.\nUnauthorized translations of famous books by authors like Taslima Nasrin, Steve Jobs, and Robert Kiyosaki flood Nepal's book market, harming authors, publishers, and readers, despite the country's copyright law.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nHow safe a place is Pakistan for young women? According to the human rights ministry, in the last three years, 63,000 cases of violence against women were reported here. This is a rough estimate as not every case of violence is brought to public notice. In fact, it is just the tip of the iceberg.A fuller picture of the state of human security in Pakistan emerges from the Trafficking in Persons Report issued annually since 2001 by the US State Department. The 2024 report was released recently. From this document, one learns of the complexity and severity of the problems created by criminal trafficking in Pakistan.Fundamentally, trafficking violates a victim’s constitutional rights to freedom and to live with dignity in a place of her/his choice. The trafficker’s basic motive is monetary gain. In today’s age of neo-liberalism, trafficking has emerged as a global crime involving a transnational mafia conducting a multibillion-dollar trade reminiscent of the slave trade of yore.Unfortunately, Pakistan as a source, transit and destination country occupies a strategic position in this heinous business. Its inability—or is it unwillingness?—to check unscrupulous elements sustains the mafia that keeps this sordid trade going. It is a lucrative source of illegal earning for the psychopath. As for the mass majority, poverty, gender inequality and illiteracy are the factors that make them so vulnerable.For unexplained reasons, not many voices have been raised against this crime against humanity. The numbers affected should jolt our conscience. According to a modest estimate, nearly 20,000 persons (80 per cent of them women) are trafficked in Pakistan every year. TIP reports from 2017 to 2021 had showed figures rising from 12,000 to 32,000. In 2022, when a kidnapped girl was recovered in Lahore and taken to court, the police spoke of 40,500 girls having been abducted in Punjab alone. For me, even one woman trafficked is one too many.It is difficult to understand why state and society accept with equanimity a social evil with profound implications for a country that claims to be an Islamic entity, and which impacts our economy, moral fibre and national image.The latest TIP Report confirms this trend. It informs us that in the investigating period (2023), the government probed 18,461 cases of which 15,022 were of sex trafficking and 3,439 of forced labour. Of these, only 6,178 were prosecuted, with a measly 10 convictions. The 2023 report had revealed a similar pattern of high numbers being investigated, followed by a drop in the number of prosecutions and a scanty lot being convicted. The punishment meted out is not disclosed. It would not be surprising if no one is imprisoned and a fine of only a few hundred thousand is imposed.How has the government reacted to this annual finger-pointing exercise by Washington? One response was to neutralise the pressure by setting up the National Commission on Human Rights in 2015, which has the mandate to address suo motu cases of human rights violations, create public awareness and conduct research on human rights matters. It also makes recommendations to the government on related issues. Consequently, Pakistan has amended existing laws and adopted new ones, the most important being the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018.The same year, the NCHR published the report The Menace of Trafficking/Smuggling: Pakistan’s Response to the Problem. Well documented, it focuses on the problem in its local setting. The law and order machinery dealing with trafficking problems has also been restructured, with the FIA being assigned to see to the international aspects of trafficking.The creation of the NCHR notwithstanding, the situation vis-à-vis trafficking in Pakistan continues to be horrendous. No one in official circles talks about it. Hence it is left to the TIP Report to expose the truth.Year after year, TIP reports have reiterated that Pakistan does not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Inadequacy, inefficiency and shoddiness in investigation is something we are all familiar with. I have experienced it whenever I have had to deal with the police. What leaves one aghast is the charge of the government being hand in glove with the criminals. TIP 2024 states: “For the fifth year, the government did not take adequate action against credible reports of official complicity in trafficking crimes, which also continued to create a culture of impunity and inhibited anti-trafficking efforts. In Sindh, local officials continued to perpetrate bonded labour with impunity in brick kilns and on farms.”In Pakistan, money can buy a criminal's acquittal and traffickers are multimillionaires. If they also enjoy the blessings of the powers that be then what do they have to worry about?-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nUnintended pregnancy, teenage pregnancy and induced abortive procedures with complications are some common reproductive health problems affecting millions of females worldwide. These issues are major causes of maternal mortality and morbidity in South Asia, posing a significant challenge to women’s sexual and reproductive health as well as social well-being and economic prospects.In Nepal, nearly half of the pregnancies are unintended and 60 percent of them end up in abortion. This directly correlates with gender inequality, socio-economic status and restrictions on sexual and reproductive rights. Early and unintended pregnancies also pose a huge barrier to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3.7, which ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including family planning, information and education and integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. Nepal's National Planning Commission 2020 states, \"The government of Nepal’s target for SDG 3.7.1, is that 74% of allwomen age 15–49 have a met need for family planning with modern methods by 2022 and 80% by 2030.\"Advancement of contraceptivesOver the past few decades, there have been tremendous advances in the development of new contraceptive technologies, and a wide variety of family planning methods have been introduced. According to the National Demographic Health Survey 2022 (NDHS), 57 percent of currently married women are using a method of contraception, 43 percent are using a modern technique, and 15 percent are using a traditional method. There has been a decline in the unmet need for family planning from 32 percent in 1996 to 21 percent in 2022, which is possibly due to contraceptives.While different methods of contraception have prevented unintended pregnancies, emergency contraceptives are on the rise today. Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are safe and effective drugs, recommended to be used within 72 hours after unprotected sexual intercourse, after accidents like condom rupture or missed pills, or if women are forced against their will to prevent pregnancy. ECPs help women avoid the adverse outcomes of unwanted pregnancies and reduce the risk of induced abortion. Offering emergency contraception is a crucial service delivery intervention for reducing this unmet need for contraception. As the name itself says, emergency contraceptives are intended only for occasional and emergency use. Counselling for the use of these pills should include options for regular contraception and advice on the correct methods in cases of perceived method failure. Concerns regarding ECPsNepal first introduced emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) through a social marketing programme in 2004. Since then, its use has risen, particularly in the last decade. The serious concerns regarding the potential use of ECP as a substitute for other contraceptives are similar to those voiced in response to the increased use of abortion in Nepal. The increased availability of over-the-counter and easy accessibility of emergency contraceptives has raised concerns regarding their safe use, misuse and potential consequences. The trend of taking ECPs as an alternative method of contraception should be seriously considered, particularly among youth. The wide advertisements, banners and posters around street corners stating it is an “easy way to the difficult situation” have misled them to either abandon or consider not using the contraceptive method regularly. It provides easy options for women to avoid unwanted or unplanned births without having to face social stigmatisation.Globally, the increasing use of ECPs has been described as an epidemic in which women are reportedly “eating contraceptives like chocolates” in Kenya and “popping them like candy” in India. The condition is similar in the context of Nepal today, where the pills are taken as a substitute for regular contraceptives. It might replace the regular use of oral combined pills, which in turn can lead to menstrual irregularities because of off-and-on withdrawal bleeding. This problem not only harms women but also potentially increases sexually transmitted diseases (STI) and HIV when condom use is replaced by repeated, indiscriminate use of emergency contraceptives. It will also deprive young women and girls of reaching out to the gynaecologist for appropriate counselling services and to consider various options regarding regular contraceptives. There is no doubt that emergency contraceptives provide a woman with the opportunity to have unprotected intercourse and ensure that every pregnancy is wanted. However, repeated misuse of emergency contraceptives needs to be evaluated for a better understanding of the positive and negative impacts of ECPs, which is critical in guiding the discourse in the right direction. Existing policies lack comprehensive implementation guidelines for the distribution of emergency contraceptive pills, necessitating integration. Comprehensive sexual health programmes and education campaigns through social media, workshops, community outreach initiatives on reproductive health and family planning methods and emergency contraceptives should be conducted. Health education on ECPs should be integrated into the curriculum to bridge the knowledge gap among youths. Similarly, equipping teachers to offer detailed sex education in urban and rural schools, incorporating public education campaigns to raise awareness about ECPs and their importance as a backup method of contraception, integrating counselling services into healthcare settings, and enhancing the competencies of paramedics, community leaders and female community health volunteers to provide basic adolescent services are urgently needed. The media, programme implementors, service providers, decision-makers and policymakers should have the right and accurate information on ECPs. There is an urgent need to disseminate information regarding family planning, pregnancy risks and contraceptive use to dispel myths and ensure the proper use of ECPs. An integrated approach is required to address the interrelated factors and create an enabling environment in which adolescents are fully aware, informed and equipped to properly utilise contraceptives and related services. As Jeff Sheffield, chairman of FIGO’s Contraception and Family Planning Committee, said, “Globally, young people, especially adolescents, do not have access to reliable, up-to-date information related to sexual and reproductive health, including contraception. This information can help inform their decisions and potentially save lives.” Let’s ponder this issue seriously.  \nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has its feet in two boats: Business and regulation. This is always a recipe for disaster. And in Nepal’s aviation sector, disasters are aplenty. Under the current director general, Pradeep Adhikari, Nepal has seen seven air crashes. In the past year-and-a-half alone, over 100 people have been killed in plane crashes. And no, the director-general hasn’t resigned yet, he in fact continues to vehemently defend his sullied record. The terms ‘accountability’ and ‘humility’ are clearly missing from his book of ethics. With the right connections across the political spectrum, he has no moral or political pressure to resign. The half-mast national flag does his task of hanging his head in shame.A European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) delegation that conducted an on-site assessment of Nepal’s air safety last September pointed out several safety concerns, clearly mentioning a couple of airline carriers and CAAN as the offending parties. An assessment report submitted to CAAN’s Adhikari raised concerns about discrepancies in the work of the Flight Operations Division and the Airworthiness Inspection Division. It noted significant gaps in overseeing fatigue related to duty period regulations and ensuring comprehensive compliance checks. The report also suggested improvement in CAAN’s oversight capabilities, personnel management, staff training and certification processes.How the CAAN has responded to the European Commission’s concerns about Nepal’s air safety over the years is there for all to see: More crashes and more killings. The commission’s request to bifurcate the civil aviation body into regulatory and service-providing institutions has fallen on deaf ears. Similarly, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the United Nations aviation watchdog, asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body and ensure a proper regulatory system two years ago. Not splitting the CAAN has created a serious conflict of interest as the same institution seeks to provide service as well as to make profit. However, Adhikari kept the report a secret, continuing to stall efforts to split CAAN.A poignant case of regulation failure was evident in the death of the wife and son of a technician who were among the 18 individuals killed in the Saurya Air crash near the runway of the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu on Wednesday. The ferry flight to Pokhara on a full maintenance mission was not supposed to carry common passengers, but it did—an egregious violation of air safety rules. As corruption and lack of accountability run rampant in Nepal’s aviation industry, with little adherence to existing regulations, air travel continues to be a risky endeavour.The captain of the ill-fated Bombardier CRJ200, who miraculously survived the crash, has made an initial statement that he could not control the aircraft after it took an altitude of a hundred feet after take-off. He would be in a position to provide more insight into the events leading up to the fatal crash of the aircraft when he regains his health. In Nepal, there has been a tradition of putting all the blame on human agency, meaning the captain, after all fatal air crashes, without making any effort to strengthen air safety regulations. No corrupt leader or bureaucrat should be allowed to perennially stop the bifurcation of CAAN and to continue to let our skies be aerial death traps.   \nNepali political parties of the Left, Right and Centre never tire of speaking about democracy. Their concern is often about democracy being in some kind of danger, although it is mostly a case of false flagging. But there is one kind of democracy they rarely talk about—the intra-party sort. Practising internal democracy seems much more difficult than seeking it elsewhere. A couple of party conventions in the past few months have highlighted the lack of internal democracy among Nepali political parties. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal), which concluded its three-day ‘unity general convention’ on June 12, elected Upendra Yadav as chairperson. Although the party announced its central committee members and central executive committee members after a month of the convention, it has failed to pick office bearers. Likewise, the CPN (Unified Socialist), which completed its six-day ‘national convention’ on July 5, elected Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal, and Ghanashyam Bhusal as chairman, senior leader, and general secretary, respectively, through consensus among the party’s top leaders. However, the party has yet to name its 206 central committee members and 18 office bearers.Once Yadav of the JSP-Nepal was elected to the chair unopposed, he halted the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13. Twenty-three candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons, and six were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—had filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary. Similarly, the Unified Socialist has yet to appoint 206 of 299 central committee members and 18 of 21 committee members in addition to finalising standing committee and politburo members. Party insiders say the top brass was busy scrutinising the backgrounds of the aspirants before making a final selection. But scrutinising may mean picking ‘yes’ men and women, especially considering the volatile nature of these parties which are either splinters from a big party or have seen their colleagues break away to form other parties.Apart from these rather fringe parties in Parliament, those that are more mainstream also struggle with the question of internal democracy. The Rastriya Swatantra Party’s joint meeting of central committee and parliamentary party set the tone for the party’s cult culture, with Rabi Lamichhane picking officer bearers considered close to him. There have also been controversies regarding an alleged manipulation of the proportional representation list to include near and dear ones of the party top brass.The situation in the top three parties—Nepali Congress, CPN (UML) and Maoist Centre—is no better. The Congress reflects a perennial vertical division of the Deuba and Koirala camps; the UML is increasingly being consolidated around the “father” figure of KP Sharma Oli, and the Maoists remain as enamoured as ever by the authoritative personality of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. With individual preferences rather than democratic values ruling the roost, the parties sustain on a feudal system offering handouts, or “tika” in the local parlance, to the sycophants while pushing away those who work hard and question the top brass. If there is one sphere that has seen a thriving “Afno Manchhe” culture—which anthropologist Dor Bahadur Bista so eloquently critiqued in his book Fatalism and Development—it is the political parties of Nepal today.  \nNepal, a country that was long in the clutches of poliovirus, made a significant stride when in 2014 the United Nations declared it “polio-free”. However, the recent detection of type-3 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV)—active viruses in the oral polio vaccine—in Kathmandu’s sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers indicates a potential outbreak. Although no one has been infected, the presence of the virus in sewage is in itself concerning. This calls for a prompt response from the authorities, as it could put Nepal’s achievements on polio at risk. According to the World Health Organisation, polio or poliomyelitis mainly affects children under five (but anyone unvaccinated is at risk). It is a water-borne disease and is transmitted through unhygienic habits, droplets or aerosols, faecal contamination, infected utensils, food and water. Infection from the virus has declined (by 99 percent) worldwide since 1988, but the WHO warns that “as long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk”. South Asian countries Pakistan and Afghanistan have also reported wild polio in wastewater in recent months. This means the risk of contagion in Nepal is far from over, and we can no longer be complacent. The emergence of VDPVs, as per the WHO and studies, is associated with low immunisation coverage. Vaccination is thus crucial to contain the spread of polio. Nepal has undertaken many vaccine campaigns against it. Still, as per the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, at least 4 percent of children aged 12-23 months have not been jabbed against any disease. The vaccine coverage rate for polio, according to the Health Ministry, is 95 throughout the country. So, the virus could strike under-vaccinated and unvaccinated children at any time. For successful eradication of the poliovirus back in 2014, the country’s efforts included routine vaccine campaigns, door-to-door calls, additional national and subnational mass vaccination campaigns, surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis, mop-up campaigns, and the introduction of injected vaccines in addition to oral vaccines. It’s time the government and healthcare authorities dusted off their old knowledge and kits. However, studies show that vaccines alone don’t help. A recent article, “Polio in Gaza: What Does This Mean For the Region and the World?” in The Conversation highlights how maintaining sanitation and hygiene can help eradicate polio.Health authorities and donor agencies have arranged special vaccination drives in Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur and are launching the campaign from today, and it will continue till July 27. They must ensure that not a single child is deprived or missed and also focus on virus surveillance in other districts and start jabbing children wherever necessary. Despite this initiative, a recent Post report highlights a significant disparity in the country’s approach to sample collection: They are taken from five tributary rivers in the Kathmandu Valley, Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces; other provinces are excluded. This isn’t comprehensive enough as poliovirus could be detected anywhere, given the constant flow of people, in and out of the country.The situation demands that the government develop country-wide monitoring, vaccination campaigns and sanitation programmes without further ado. If these measures are not prioritised, it could be a matter of time before we have another polio wave on our hands.   \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli secured a resounding majority in the House of Representatives on Sunday. Getting 188 votes in the 275-strong chamber, Oli showed the backing of over two-thirds members of the lower house. This in itself is a positive start to a new stint as prime minister for Oli. A powerful government is in the interest of the country that has been reeling under economic crisis, unemployment and other problems. However, securing an overwhelming House majority at the start of the term is nothing new for a Nepali prime minister. CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who secured over 97 percent votes in the House in January 2023, had to go for the floor test three more times before he was ousted earlier this month. In the fourth vote, he was supported by only 22 percent of the members of the same House.When KP Sharma Oli became prime minister for the second time in February 2018, he returned to Singhadurbar with a strong mandate as the erstwhile left alliance of the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) won a resounding majority in the 2017 general elections. In May the same year, they converted the left alliance into a single unified party making Oli a strong prime minister, commanding an overwhelming majority in the federal parliament. But this unified force fell apart and the two mother parties were revived in March 2021. When the Supreme Court in July 2021 ousted Oli, the UML chair lost not only the trust of other parties but also the support of many lawmakers from his own party. These are just a few instances. If history is any guide, securing a big parliamentary majority at the start means little if cannot be protected for any length of time. The goal should rather be to use this strength for the benefit of the country’s larger good.The country needs a strong government and political stability—more specifically, policy consistency. The government in place in turn urgently needs to address pressing issues—prolonged economic stagnation, slow development activities, unemployment, brain drain, corruption. But the mother of all problems is the protracted economic crisis. So the top priority should be to fix the economy. This done, many other things will fall into place.Prime Minister Oli is praised not only by his party comrades but also the rivals for his bold decision making capacity. But he is also often accused of bulldozing others’ views. This is also why in 2021 he irked many leaders within his party as well as chiefs of other political forces and lost their support. Oli’s statements after becoming prime minister last week suggest a change. The remarks he has made in the House on domestic as well as foreign relations are more balanced this time. The prime minister must not forget that the support of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, has made it possible for him to return to power with a strong parliamentary support. His relations, mainly with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, is going to be crucial.
