Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAfter a long eighteen-year gap, Nepal and China are all set to hold boundary talks in Beijing next week. The meeting comes days ahead of the Nepal-China foreign secretary-level talks slated for June 25.Amrit Rai, foreign ministry spokesman, said the Joint Expert Group meeting next week will be led by the Director General of the Department of Survey. The meeting will take place on June 19 and 20 in Beijing.The Nepali delegation will include representatives from ministries including foreign affairs, home affairs, defence, and land management, cooperatives and poverty alleviation, as well as the Nepali Embassy in Beijing.According to Rai, the delegation led by Prakash Joshi, director general of the Department of Survey, will head for Beijing on Sunday.The Chinese team will be led by someone from the Department of Border and Ocean Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China.The last meeting of the Joint Expert Group was held in 2006 in Kathmandu. The mechanism mandates a joint inspection of the Nepal-China border, dispute resolution, and finalisation of the fourth protocol to be signed by the two sides. The third Nepal-China boundary protocol was signed in 1988.According to multiple officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, the meeting is expected to discuss the status of the Nepal-China boundary; the date for commencing a joint boundary inspection; disputes in Nepal-China border; and also the signing of the Border Management System, whose initial agreement was signed during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. The Chinese side has sent a copy of the border management agreement, which is now under the review of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, according to a joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.According to a senior official familiar with the matter, although the text of the Boundary Management System is yet to be released, it envisions forming two panels—a joint commission on boundary matters between Nepal and China, and a committee of boundary representatives to be led by competent authorities from the two countries.Nepal is yet to ratify the boundary management system.The joint secretary said the meeting will also discuss some outstanding issues, such as the timing and form of inspection, and whether it should start anew or resume from where it was left in 2006.“We should start a new joint inspection as a lot has changed on the ground,” Krishna Raj BC, former director general of the Department of Survey, told the Post. When BC was director general at the department in 2011, Nepal and China were all set to sign the fourth boundary protocol by addressing issues like the height of Mt Everest and the exact location of pillar number 57 in Dolakha district, among other things. But the government called off the meeting at the last moment, and the plan to sign the fourth boundary protocol stalled.Nepal and China concluded their first boundary talks in 1961 and signed the Boundary Protocol in 1963.The 1963 Joint Boundary Protocol has the provision of constituting three different mechanisms to deal with boundary issues—the Joint Inspection Team, Joint Expert Group, and Joint Inspection Committee. The mechanisms were enshrined in the Nepal-China Boundary Protocol signed between the two countries on January 20, 1963. Later Nepal and China renewed the Boundary Protocol in 1979 and 1988.While the Joint Expert Group is led by the director general of the Department of Survey from the Nepali side and their Chinese counterpart, the Joint Inspection Committee is led by the deputy director general or under secretary from the Department of Survey and their Chinese counterpart, as per the practice and provisions. Similarly, the joint inspection committee is led by the joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.“If we are going to hold the meeting after such a long time, we should start afresh,” said BC, who later became a government secretary. “We should shun the old position as we will sign the new protocol after jointly conducting a fresh inspection of the boundary.” BC also led the joint boundary inspection between Nepal and China, completed the task and was to leave for Xian, China, for the meeting, which was later called off by the Nepali side.One of the major boundary disputes between was over the height of Mt Everest, which was resolved in 2020 with the two sides jointly announcing the new height as 8,848.86 metres. But several other issues remain unresolved.Two officials from two different ministries said the Chinese side has been asking for homework time before conducting the joint boundary inspection, but the Nepali side has been insisting on resuming it promptly, arguing that no additional homework is needed.Officials from the foreign and land management ministries said the Chinese side is trying to tie up the boundary meeting, joint boundary inspection, and signing of the boundary protocol with the signing of the boundary management system, something which the Nepali side has long stalled.Chinese security personnel have numerous border outposts and have been actively patrolling the Nepal-China border and this makes it easier for them to conduct joint inspections, the officials said. Nepal has fewer border outposts compared to Chinese, but Nepal is still prepared for joint inspection, they said.“We should address both old and new boundary issues during the meeting, like those related to joint inspection and signing of boundary protocol. As far as I know, there were two unresolved points during our last meeting. If we are unable to resolve the disputed issues, they will be recorded in minutes and included in the protocol,” said BC.As per the boundary protocol, Nepal and China should conduct a joint boundary inspection every ten years and sign the updated protocol, but that has not happened. “That is why the Nepali side has been insisting on a joint inspection,” said a joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.We have several reports from the fields provided by the Armed Police Force (APF), said an under secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs.Likewise, A joint secretary at the Ministry of Land Management told the Post that joint inspection of the Nepal and China boundary is one of the toughest tasks. “This is due to the difficult geographical terrain, freezing cold, lack of infrastructure like roads and treacherous mountains where the surveyors need to climb up to 5,000 metres for measurements. These factors make joint inspection complicated and time-consuming. The work may take up to a year,” he saidAnother former official of the Department of Survey told the Post that on the Chinese side, there are fully-equipped border outposts every five kilometres along most stretches of the border, “but on our side, boundary inspection has never been the priority. The government does not allocate enough budget to protect and safeguard the border, be it north or south.” Back in July 2022, officials from Nepal and China had held a virtual talk where they decided to activate the existing boundary mechanisms through mutual consultation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on July 15, 2022. According to officials and experts, Nepal and China have a dispute over pillar number 57 in Dolakha district, which was a major bone of contention following the resolution of the height of Mt Everest in December 2020. Besides pillar no 57, disputes have often surfaced in Humla, Gorkha, and Kimathanka (Sankhuwasabha), which need to be resolved through joint inspection.In addition to resolving disputes, as per the boundary protocol, both sides should update the boundary status every 10 years.The Nepali side, during the official visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who is also the State Councilor of China, in March 2022, had proposed forming a mechanism in order to conduct joint inspection of the border and update the latest status. The Nepal-China border spans 1,439 kilometres. Toya Baral, who led the 2006 meeting of the Joint Expert Group in Kathmandu, recalled, “The 2006 meeting prepared the boundary map using the global positioning system. As far as I remember, there has been no such meeting between Nepal and China.”“After meeting with the Chinese, we conducted a joint inspection and prepared a digital map,” said Baral. “The mechanism was also tasked with repair and maintenance of boundary pillars.”“We had almost finalised the boundary works besides settling the height of Mt Everet, and resolving the dispute over marker no 57. Some damaged pillars were also repaired. The map was digitalised, and we were tasked with finding the old boundary maps and evidence to ensure accurate positioning,” said Baral.Despite Nepal government’s claims that the Nepal-China border is largely free from disputes, there are reports of several boundary-related issues like encroachment, fencing and wiring, illegal construction, missing border pillars, lack of maintenance of boundary markers, and use of high-level digital surveillances in the border by the Chinese side. Nepali security agencies deployed on the border reported these issues to the Ministry of Home Affairs.In October 2021, a panel led by joint secretary Jay Narayan Acharya of the Ministry of Home Affairs submitted a report to the ministry after inspecting the boundary status in Humla district and made several recommendations. The report called for jointly addressing boundary matters and issues with China. “There has been a practice of addressing such issues through Joint Inspection Team, Joint Expert Group and Joint Inspection Committee,” says the report. “That’s why there is a need to activate these mechanisms.”“Such sensitive and bilateral matters related to the border need to be addressed through a permanent mechanism, but it is found that no such initiative has been taken,” states the report.Boundary issues with China surface in Nepal occasionally, and different governments have treated the matter differently. After media reports in September 2020 said China was “illegally constructing nine buildings inside the Nepali territory,” then foreign minister Pradip Gyawali swiftly refuted these claims.The Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu also denied any boundary issues between Nepal and China. \nNepal outlawed child marriage in 1963.However, more than six decades later, the evil tradition is still in practice, due to which the country has been facing far-reaching and consequences, according to a report titled “Behavioural Determinants of Child Marriage and Adolescent Pregnancy In Nepal.The report of a study jointly carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council and the United Nations Children’s Fund from November 2022 to April 2023 and published in 2024 also states that the behavioural drivers of child marriage and adolescent pregnancy in Nepal are multifaceted and deeply intertwined with societal norms, economic conditions and cultural expectations. “Poverty, discriminatory practices and limited agency of adolescents, especially girls and in certain communities, contribute to early marriages,” reads the report. “Child marriage and adolescent pregnancy have for individuals, families and communities.”Participants noted severe consequences of child marriage, including adolescent pregnancy, malnutrition, uterine prolapse, infant mortality and mental health issues.According to the report, almost 20 percent of students expected to be in Grades 9 and 10 in Tripurasundari Municipality, Karnali Province, have left school due to marriage. Early marriage is nearly universal among Dalits in Dolpa district, with an almost 100 per cent prevalence rate, often leading to early pregnancies.The influence of family decisions, perceptions of physical attractiveness and the desire for independence also play a pivotal role in child marriage.These practices perpetuate cycles of poverty and underdevelopment, limiting the potential of young girls and hindering societal progress, the report noted. The impact on the health of young brides and their children is severe, with increased risks of pregnancy-related complications, malnutrition, infant mortality rates, uterine prolapse and long-term health consequences, it said. Additionally, the study also identified that the lack of comprehensive education and awareness, coupled with societal pressures and traditional beliefs, contribute to the perpetuation of these practices. The prevalence of teenage marriages and pregnancies is widespread, especially in marginalized communities across the country.According to the report of the study, child marriage also contributes to suicide in some cases. A few early-married couples reportedly ended their lives due to their parent’s refusal to accept their marriage.Researchers talked to a teacher from Jhapa, who recounted a young couple's suicide in a tea garden after their family pressured them to separate to preserve the family’s honour. Key persons in the Gurung and Kham Magar communities highlighted issues arising from miscommunication when a spouse works abroad. Instances of extramarital affairs or remarriage while away can also lead to family conflicts, occasionally resulting in suicides.Child marriage diminishes educational opportunities, causing many girls to drop out of school and restricting their empowerment. Adolescent girls from Muslim and Musahar communities told researchers that they felt discomfort attending school in traditional marriage attire, like bangles and kurtas, while their classmates wore school uniforms. Furthermore, the financial implications extend to the families involved, exacerbating economic challenges. The lack of education and job opportunities, along with the burden of raising a family, traps young couples in a cycle of poverty, according to the report. The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 conducted by the Ministry of Health and Population, shows that overall, 14 percent of women aged 15-19 have been pregnant, including 10 percent who have had a live birth, while two percent experienced a pregnancy loss.Teenage pregnancy is highest in Karnali Province, at 21 percent, followed by Madhesh Province, at 20 percent, Koshi and Gandaki Province, at 13 percent, and Lumbini Province, at 10 percent, according to the 2022 survey.The Health Ministry survey suggests that the decision to quit school may contribute to early pregnancy among young girls. The report states that 33 percent of girls aged between 15 and 19 with no formal education are more likely to start childbearing earlier than those with at least some secondary education, which stands at eight percent.Nepal has pledged to end child marriage by 2030 as part of its commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Constitution of Nepal.However, despite efforts to combat the practice, Nepal has the eighth-highest rate of child marriage in the world and the third-highest rate in South Asia. According to Nepal’s Civil Code, the minimum age for marriage is 20 for both women and men. As per Article 173 of the Criminal Code, anyone found guilty of either committing or arranging a child marriage faces up to three years in jail and a fine of Rs30,000. \nChildren aged between five and 11 years with compromised immunity will be administered the Covid vaccine, according to health officials.The Covax facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, has agreed to provide 100,000 doses of the children’s vaccine, and supply will start in the last week of June, according to officials at the Ministry of Health and Population.“These 100,000 doses are part of the 2.5 million doses, which Covax had agreed to supply to Nepal in 2024,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Children between five and 11 having underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.”Last month, Nepal confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country. All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new Covid cases in the last few months.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.The Covax facility supplied millions of doses of various brands of the coronavirus vaccine, which were used to inoculate the majority of the country's population.Officials said that Nepal will receive 1.6 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccine by the end of this month, including the children’s vaccine, from Covax. The rest of the doses of the monovalent vaccine to be received later will be administered to the adult population in all provinces of the country. The monovalent or single component is designed for the Omicron variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Earlier, the facility used to supply Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine doses that included a component of the original virus strain as well as a part of the Omicron variant to provide broad protection against Covid.The vaccine is called a bivalent Covid shot as it contains two components: the original virus strain and Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nWhen 24-year-old Samjhana Bishwakarma and her partner Jeshika Gautam sought to rent a place, they were rejected at the last moment when the homeowner knew about their sexual orientation. Everything was all but decided but then the homeowner became dodgy and they eventually had to find a new place to live in. “It was disheartening,” Bishwakarma says.Bishwakarma identifies herself as a lesbian woman, and her partner a masculine lesbian. They’ve been together for six years and have been living together in their current residence for three years. Their current homeowners know well about their relationship, and are accommodating of them. Despite the occasional weird looks, they have little to worry about. “It has been very fulfilling staying at this place because of everybody’s acceptance,” Bishwakarma says.Though Nepal is considered relatively progressive when it comes to queer rights, people from the queer community in the country are still subjected to prejudices and discrimination. And as a result, finding a place to rent can be an uphill battle, as it was for Bishwakarma and Gautam. They are often compelled to hide their relationship and lie to their homeowners and neighbours that they are either siblings or friends.So did 55-year-old Shila Gurung and his partner Sita Rana. In the beginning, they told their homeowners and neighbours that they were close friends living together. They reside in Nepalgunj, and have been living together for years now. Gurung is a transgender man.“After we came into contact with queer organisations and queer friends from all over Nepal, we gradually started to feel safe enough to embrace our relationship in society,” Gurung says. Things are starting to become better when it comes to accepting queerness and queer relationships, but acceptance from everybody fully is something that will definitely take time, Gurung adds.Recently, Nepal saw a few groundbreaking developments that guaranteed equal rights to gender and sexual minorities in the country. In June 2023, the Supreme Court ordered the registration of same-sex and non-heterosexual marriage and in November of the same year, Maya Gurung and Surendra Pandey became the first same-sex couple to register their marriage in South Asia.But the road to reach this point has been difficult for the community, and it still is on various fronts. In Surendra and Maya’s case, too, familial acceptance was lacking, and it took them years to register their marriage. Many queer couples in a live-in relationship hope to eventually get married and have their marriage legally registered, but despite existing laws, implementation remains subpar.Article 15 of the constitution forbids discrimination against anyone based on gender and sexual orientation. However, Bimala Gurung, programme coordinator at Mitini Nepal, says that prejudice against queer couples has manifested in many ways, and one of them is mistreatment by homeowners.“Sometimes, homeowners indirectly force their queer tenants to leave by stopping their fair supply of water or electricity,” Gurung says.Meanwhile, many queer couples choose to flee their homes when their family members refuse to accept them. In July last year, the Post reported that a young couple eloped together when one side of the family was adamantly homophobic. In another similar story, a lesbian couple, Pabitra Badi Nepali and Bimala BK, ran away at a young age to live together due to persistent familial pressure to split, and marry others. When they returned home with the intention of building a life together in their village, they were shunned and ridiculed by their villagers.In a society that resists queer romantic relationships, it is essential to create safe spaces for queer couples to live their life the way they want, experts say. Normalising queer live-in relationships and marriages is one step towards attaining that goal, they add.Twenty-three-year-old Sarita Ruchal and her partner had to be initially cautious of living together because of unsolicited questions directed towards her partner, who is a transgender man. When people would hear her partner talking, they would question his sexuality. They would tell him that he had a woman’s voice, while asking the couple how two women could live together. This was when they resided in Baneshwar, Kathmandu.Things have changed for the better, however. At their new place in Bauddha, their homeowner is entirely accepting of their relationship, and so are their neighbours. And the couple no longer feel the need to hide their relationship.“I think Nepali society has made some progress in accepting people from queer communities and queer relationships,” says Ruchal. “I am incredibly happy at my new place. We feel safe here.”Gurung, programme coordinator at Mitini Nepal, also agrees that increased awareness in urban areas has made people more empathetic towards the community. However, the concept of gender binary that believes romantic, sexual and marital relationships only occur between the opposite sexes is instilled in the fabric of society, she added.Experts suggest that to properly monitor instances of discrimination against queer communities—including mistreatment by homeowners—keeping a database of the number of queer couples in a particular ward and provinces could be valuable. Filing a police complaint could be an option to seek justice for those couples who were shunned by their families for their relationship, but that step may be long and difficult for the couples themselves.Queer individuals often seek counselling to combat the social discrimination they face on a daily basis, Gurung says. “Awareness is increasing,” she says. “But there still needs to be better work on the part of stakeholders and service providers for queer couples to enjoy their free will as any heterosexual couples.” \nNepal blew their chances of qualifying for the Super Eight of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup after losing to South Africa by a single run in a last-over nail-biter at the Arnos Vale Ground in West Indies.The Rhinos had everything on the line and were in need of two runs off the last ball of the game when Gulshan Jha was caught between the wickets by Quinton de Kock.Earlier, the Rhinos put up a great bowling display, restricting South Africa, who were sent to bat first, to a lowly total of 115 runs.Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 runs off 11 balls before being dismissed by Dipendra Singh Airee in 3.4 overs. Kushal Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after.Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks managed to stay on the ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavilion by Airee in 15.3 overs.Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play.Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-0ver spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs.Despite the easy chase, Nepal found themselves on the losing end, putting 114 runs at a loss of seven wickets at the end of the stipulated 20 overs.The Rhinos were off to a good start with openers Bhurtel and Aashif Sheikh building a decent first-wicket partnership. However, the tides turned quickly for Nepal as South Africa’s Tabraiz Shamsi struck twice in a single over, dismissing Bhurtel for 13 in 7.2 overs, and captain Rohit Paudel for a duck only two deliveries later.Sheikh stood undeterred, building a half-century partnership with Anil Sah to bring some much-needed relief to the Nepali innings. Sah scored 27 runs, which featured three boundaries and a six, before being caught by Marco Jansen off Aiden Markram.Just as the innings were steadying for the Rhinos, Shamsi struck again, proving a thorn in Nepal’s flesh. Nepal were in need of 18 runs off as many deliveries at the end of 16 overs when they dealt a massive blow, losing Dipendra Singh Aireec (6), Aasif Sheikh (42) and Kushal Malla (1) in a span of five balls.Tension ran high as Nepal were still in need of eight runs with an over to spare. Gulshan Jha, who took to the field at number seven, missed twice, narrowing the game down to eight runs with four deliveries in hand.Jha then smashed a boundary. The game was down to two runs off as many balls, but he missed again. With only a single delivery remaining, Jha and his partner Sompal Kami made the run for an equaliser, but the former was run out, ending Nepal’s hopes of competing in the World Cup.For South Africa, Tabraiz Shamsi grabbed four wickets while Aiden Markram also dismissed a Nepali batter. \nIn what looks like a perfect example of a circle of financial gain and loss, Nepal is sending a significant amount of money, much of which is earned through remittance, to foreign destinations every year to pay for the higher education of Nepalis. In the first nine months of the fiscal year 2023-24, which began in mid-July, the country sent out 95.85 billion rupees in foreign education alone. The figure could be even higher, as students and their guardians often find non-conventional or illegal mediums, including hundi, to transfer money abroad. What is alarming is that the official figures represent a 42.5 percent increase from the same duration in the last fiscal year, when students took Rs67.19 billion to spend on education abroad. In FY 2022-23, the total outgoing amount stood at Rs142 billion, a 48 percent rise from the Rs67.70 billion in FY 2021-22.Along with cash, the number of Nepali youths leaving home for education abroad is growing each year. In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, over 90,000 students have obtained the no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Education. The total figure for FY 2022-23 stood at over 110,000, while it was almost 113,000 in FY 2021-22. As per the Ministry of Education, the number of students obtaining NOC has tripled in the past decade. That these students start earning after a few years and send money is a positive fact not to be missed—Nepal’s remittance is growing every year, thanks to the students-turned-non-resident Nepalis and labour migrants. But what we gain from remittance, we end up losing in the form of human capital. At a median age of 27.1, we are still a relatively younger country, which makes us a lucrative source for the export of youths.Our youths are heading out of the country in hundreds of thousands each year, and the risk is that they might return to the country only when we have missed the train of development. It is no surprise that 33 percent of the NOCs are obtained for study in Japan, a country of old people with a median age of almost 50 years. Ageing or aged developed countries like Japan, the United States and Canada, among many others, need a constant supply of youth migrants willing to toil hard. Poor countries of Asia and Africa have become rich sources for the export of cheap labour that not only sustains the economies of developed countries but also supplies children who transform from immigrants to naturalised citizens and keep those countries in rude demographic health.Meanwhile, those in positions of power in Nepal, including political leaders, bureaucrats and university and school authorities, continue to turn the country into an undesirable place. As education becomes expensive and the job market is saturated, youths see no reason to stay back in Nepal. While education abroad is no guarantee of success, we have collectively failed to assure students of the quality of education we are offering at home. Apart from improving the quality itself, we also need to work on image-building—that Nepal’s education is not as bad as it has been made out to be.    \nThe Nepali cricket team’s second-ever T20 World Cup should have been a moment of joy but has turned into a dark crisis. But first, some introductions.Ever since I can remember, playing and watching cricket have been important parts of my identity. I have followed with joy the rise of Nepali cricket over the last 20 years. I am what you might call a fanatic. I never miss any Nepal match if I can help it, be it a friendly with a local club in India, a crunch qualifier against one of our nemesis associate nations, or a World Cup match against a Test nation. It does not matter what time zone a match is being played or where I am. I have also followed Sandeep Lamichhane’s career closely. He put Nepali cricket on the international map, and whether he played for the national team or some local T20 franchise, I tried to find a working link to be able to watch him play.I am establishing these credentials first because I expect fellow passionate Nepali cricket fans will rush to dismiss what comes next. But I want you to know that I love Nepali cricket just as much as you do, and so this is not part of some conspiracy to discredit Sandeep or Nepali cricket. Quite the opposite: I care about Nepali cricket too much to stay silent. At a time when populist stunts are rife, it feels necessary to speak truth to power, as an expression of love. Custodians of rape cultureMuch has been written about Sandeep’s Gaushala-26 rape case. As a rule of thumb, I choose to believe victims. The harassment she has faced—which culminated in her suicide attempt—beggars belief. She has remained steadfast against all pressure, rejecting advances to “settle” the case. It is hard to imagine why else anyone would willingly subject themselves to such inhumane treatment. This reflection, though, is not just about whether Sandeep raped Gaushala-26. My focus here is to examine Sandeep’s case as a textbook example of how our institutions perpetuate rape culture, where sexual abuse and violence are normalised. Custodian 1: The fansEver since Sandeep has been accused, the vast majority of his fans have taken to social media to defend him, as well as to defame the victim. Perhaps it is no surprise in a deeply patriarchal society in the grips of populism, where hero worship has taken new heights. Sandeep is a hero to many, and apparently he can do no wrong. Or, even if he wrongs, he is still above the law because he can bowl a mean googly, and that’s what matters. These fans- mostly but not exclusively young men- are vocal in their support for Sandeep. Even when he was a convicted felon, never mind when he was just accused of being a rapist- that too potentially of a minor- cricket mattered more to his devotees. Such craze toward their favourite cricketer substantially sustained a rape culture where allegations of sexual abuse were relegated to oblivion. When an overwhelming, assertive, visible, and vitriolic population aggressively downplays rape charges, it extinguishes any hope victims might have in their elusive quest for justice. Custodian 2: The courtsEvery level of the court system has already weighed in on Sandeep’s case. The Supreme Court—in its infinite wisdom—allowed him to represent the national team and travel abroad while on trial for rape charges. Along with the Prime Minister, who found it fitting to felicitate Sandeep in the middle of his trial, the Supreme Court’s tacit endorsement of Sandeep has made a mockery of victims’ rights and cemented rape culture as the established norm in Nepal. The Kathmandu District Court was at least bold enough to convict Sandeep of rape, though it did not find the victim to be a minor, which would have led to more significant consequences for Sandeep. Knowledge sources had commented then that this was already paving the way for a successful appeal later, which soon came to pass. The High Court overturned that conviction, acquitting Sandeep of all charges. Almost instantaneously, the fans came out in droves and celebrated that decision. Social media is swarmed with comments about how if Sandeep was punished when convicted, he should be reinstated immediately now that he is acquitted. It is an open secret that the judiciary- like many other institutions in Nepal- is compromised. Power and privilege run deep, and decisions are not just made on the merits of the legal argument. To all the fans now celebrating Sandeep’s acquittal and making that the basis for his rehabilitation, I have just one question: If you are from a poor family and if your loved one is sexually assaulted by someone rich, powerful, or politically connected, do you genuinely expect our judicial system to impart justice and punish the perpetrator? Take a moment, put yourself in the shoes of Gaushala-26’s family, and reflect on this question. If you honestly believe that justice would be served, I have a bridge to sell you.Custodian 3: CAN and the cricketing fraternityThe Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has towed a fine line, appearing to uphold the law in the strictest sense. As soon as Sandeep was convicted, CAN suspended him from all cricketing activities. He was only reinstated after he was acquitted by the High Court. Dig a bit deeper though, and rape culture rears its ugly head. Even while facing serious rape charges, CAN was not compelled by any sense of morality to prevent him from representing Nepal. Within moments of the High Court’s acquittal, CAN officials rushed to announce that Sandeep had been reinstated. They went above and beyond to lobby the US Embassy to grant him a visa on time. When that failed, they facilitated his travel to St. Vincent and the Grenadines for him to play the remaining matches. They have lobbied the International Cricket Council to ensure his inclusion while sacrificing another player from the squad. To be sure, CAN has faced incredible scrutiny and received intense pressure from “the fans” to back Sandeep. Yet, the rush to not only rehabilitate but actually elevate Sandeep demonstrates that CAN only saw the case as a nuisance. Even if the legal burden of proof might not have been met, CAN could and should have investigated whether Sandeep met the national team’s code of conduct, as has been customary in similar cases around the world. It should have taken time to study the decision, and it could have waited for the legal process to reach its logical conclusion; it is all but certain that a Supreme Court appeal will follow. What CAN has not done speaks volumes of how rape culture is sustained in Nepal. To my knowledge, no official has spoken publicly about whether Sandeep’s actions violated the expectations placed on national players, or expressed concern or solidarity for the victim. The reasons for Sandeep’s absence have been conveniently ignored, as if he has simply been on holiday or nursing a minor injury. Just as his absence was unexplained, so too has his return been left ‘unsaid’. The gaslighting of the entire saga shows the contempt with which the issue is treated in Nepal. The wider cricketing fraternity—which includes players, former players, coaches, commentators, sponsors, and officials—has, at best, adopted a veil of silence or, at worst, come out publicly in Sandeep’s support. Respected national and international commentators have found it convenient to use phrases such as “Sandeep is not available” when away and “Sandeep, the talisman of Nepali cricket, is back” now, without any mention of the dark context. A moment to engage with and educate a whole nation on how to take rape charges, and its victim, seriously has been left unaddressed. Because, of course, cricket comes first. A naïve hopeI expect the backlash to this piece to be swift and severe. It feels poignant that I am travelling to watch Nepal play in the World Cup in the very matches Sandeep will now play. But his celebrated return has filled me with dread, anxiety, and disgust, to the point that I do not know how to support my beloved team anymore. Spare a thought for Gaushala-26 and for all victims of rape and rape culture. Regardless of the legalese, we must strive to build a culture where victims are empowered and supported to speak up and stand for the truth. Nepali cricket has always found a way through adversity, often miraculously. Our obsession with star power must be replaced with a focus on the role cricket, and citizens, should play in sustaining a culture of accountability and respect for victims. As amazing as it is, cricket is still only a game and must become a vehicle for good, not evil.  \nAmidst ongoing violence, the international community pursues criminal prosecution in Ukraine, Sudan, Israel, and Gaza to address victims' rights to justice, but it faces challenges in balancing individual accountability with victims' needs for redress and truth.\nGovernment agencies and contractors engage in last-minute capital spending in Nepal's \"Asarey Vikas\" model, leading to substandard work and hindering development progress due to bureaucratic inefficiencies and lack of financial planning.\nGermany crushed Scotland 5-1 in Euro 2024 with a dominant first half performance, including three goals, and extended their lead after Scotland's Porteous was sent off, securing the biggest opening game margin of victory in the tournament's history.\nBiden may announce a program allowing immigrants illegally residing in the US to become legalized if married to US citizens, potentially energizing liberal voters in the upcoming election.\nThe weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country today.Koshi, Bagmati, Madhesh and hilly areas of Gandaki provinces will experience partly to generally cloudy weather while the rest of the country will be partly cloudy to mainly fair, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.Light to moderate rain with thunder is likely to occur at a few places of Koshi Province and Bagmati provinces.

Established in 1960, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing grants and zero- to low-interest loans for programmes that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people’s living conditions.Replenishing IDA’s resources will be a key topic of the meeting, which comes at the midpoint of a funding cycle concluding in December 2024—when donors commit to contributions for July 2025 to June 2028.The June 18 session kicks off four days of closed-door meetings to discuss IDA21’s proposed focus areas, assess the financing needs of countries supported by IDA, and consider financing scenarios.The overarching theme for IDA21 is ‘ending poverty on a livable planet: delivering impact with urgency and ambition’.To fulfil this, the IDA21 policy package will have five focus areas: people, planet, prosperity, infrastructure and digitalisation, supported by four lenses of gender, jobs, fragility, conflict and violence, and private investments. The current replenishment (IDA20) ends on June 30, 2025.The target, or a narrow range of scenarios, for the pledging session, is typically agreed upon at the fourth replenishment meeting in October. IDA21 resources will be available for commitments for a three-year period starting July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2028.IDA will continue to provide special support for countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence and utilise windows to provide additional resources specific to key thematic priorities, such as crisis response, addressing regional challenges, and providing blended finance for private sector investments in IDA countries, among others.“IDA is scaling up its market share significantly, also enabling co-financing and coordinating donor resources to maximise impact. IDA is a transparent, accountable, and cost-effective platform that delivers results, making it a prime investment for global development finance. So you can get a sense of how important this meeting is,” said Hadad-Zervos.He said that Nepal's development story is original. “It is one of economic transformation in the face of various challenges. It faced almost every challenge that a country could face—conflict, earthquakes, Covid, climate crisis, floods, and many others.”“This confluence has put Nepal's development gains at risk. Yet Nepal is a very resilient country. And despite these challenges, it has achieved significant development progress,” he said.Shree Krishna Nepal, joint-secretary at the finance ministry, said that the World Bank Group’s first economic mission to Nepal was in 1963 to assess the country's developing prospects and challenges. The group approved its first credit in 1969 for a telecommunications project that continues to be transformative today.Since then, IDA has provided Nepal with $6 billion in credits and grants. Currently, the World Bank is supporting 24 projects worth $2.3 billion. The World Bank said IDA is also helping transform the lives of millions of Nepalis through investments in education, health, jobs and skills, connectivity and infrastructure, social protection, food security, and others.A robust IDA 21 replenishment will ensure that IDA countries continue to benefit from it and that IDA continues its decades-long track record of lifting millions of people out of poverty, providing quality education for children, ensuring access to health services, and creating jobs so that people in low-income countries can become self-sustainable and living, according to the multilateral funding agency. \nNarendra Modi begins his third term as Prime Minister of India, with South Asian leaders attending the swearing-in ceremony, amid ongoing bilateral issues with Nepal on boundary disputes and the Agnipath recruitment scheme.\nNepal's Supreme Court overturned a land swap decision, prompting opposition criticism of the Oli government's \"policy corruption,\" highlighting concerns about opaque lawmaking in the country.\nThe collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress. In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  \nAfter a three-year delay, Nepal's telecom regulator is preparing to auction 5G frequency despite telecom service providers stating the market is not ready due to low data usage, high infrastructure investment costs, and ongoing disputes with the government.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled.

The ministry has sought information on the teachers and professors affiliated to the parties from the Election Commission and the respective district education units.The initiative was taken as per the Political Parties Act, 2017 which prohibits the teachers, professors and other government employees from engaging in politics. Similarly, the Patan High Court on October 5, 2021 had ruled that school teachers cannot engage in active politics. Responding to a writ petition, the court said those drawing salaries and benefits from the state coffers should not be involved in partisan politics. The major parties have disapproved of Shrestha’s move as a large number of teachers are their cadres. For instance, as many as 263 of the 4,743 representatives to the Nepali Congress general convention held in December 2021 were school teachers and staff. The number is above five percent of the total delegates.The main opposition CPN-UML also had dozens of teachers as representatives in its 10th general congress held in November that year. Hundreds of school teachers are associated with the CPN (Maoist Centre) as well.Leaders from all these parties have criticised the move directly or indirectly. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel said the principals of many best-performing community schools were affiliated to different parties.“It is unnecessary to test teachers’ DNA. Let them work,” he said, implying that there was no need to probe whether the teachers are affiliated to a political party.Another factor antagonising the major parties is Shrestha’s decision to make public the report of the High-Level National Education Commission— more than five years after it was submitted to then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli.On June 7, she made public the report that Oli and his successors had for years kept under wraps. The government was under the pressure of private schools to keep the report a secret as it envisions converting the schools registered as companies into trusts within 10 years. Converting the existing schools into trusts would mean they will be barred from taking profits home. Several cross-party leaders have investments in private schools.Oli was so annoyed by Minister Shrestha’s decision to make the report public that he resorted to making personal remarks about her nationality and marital status without naming her.Now the teachers’ unions of various parties have united against her. The ministry on May 27 endorsed a directive guiding teachers’ transfers. The directive came amid allegations that teachers are being transferred without fulfilling the due procedure. The directive is accused of encroaching on the authority of the School Management Committee and increasing the ministry’s role in transfers. “Your good education is meaningless if you are doing more harm than good to the education sector,” said Shankar Adhikari, chair of the teacher association close to the Maoist Centre, referring to Shrestha’s foreign degree. “She has a shallow understanding of Nepal's education sector.”Leaders of other teacher associations have asked the minister to reverse the directive, warning of the consequences of not doing so. “The directive was issued with the mala fide intent of troubling teachers. This is unacceptable,” said Gyanedra Rawal of the Nepal Teachers’ Union, the Congress teachers’ wing.Some lawmakers and education experts, however, have supported minister Shrestha, saying she is on the right track to improve the country's education sector. Addressing the lower house meeting on Wednesday, independent lawmaker Amresh Kumar Singh said he fully supports the education minister, who is making the necessary intervention. “The education minister is taking the right course. Her works need to be appreciated,” he said.Those who have followed Shrestha’s work also praise her. “She [Shrestha] is eager to bring about vital changes, mainly in school education,” said Usha Jha, a former member of the National Planning Commission.However, many officials at the ministry are unhappy with her work. While she is dedicated to her job, she has a habit of not listening to others, they allege. “The minister thinks she knows everything and is not accommodative. This is the reason her decisions are dragged into controversy,” said a senior official at the ministry. “A minister is a team leader who has to take all the staff along. But that is not the case now.” \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, is set for its Unity General Convention, which will commence on Monday in Janakpur, a month after the party suffered a split.The federal chair of the JSP-Nepal, Ashok Rai, along with seven federal lawmakers and 30 central committee members, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party.The party split was more visible at the centre, but it is said to have had a lesser impact on Yadav’s faction in the province so far.Party insiders say the dissidents in provincial assemblies and party committees couldn’t get organised to form new committees as the registration of the new party at the election commission was immediately challenged in the Supreme Court. The court asked the commission and other authorities to put the process on hold, and the case is still sub judice. When the court gives a verdict on the issue, the JSP-Nepal's fence-sitters may decide whether to remain with the party or defect to the new outfit.Just a week before the unity general convention, the party suffered another setback as it had to give up the chief minister’s post in Madhesh Province when the erstwhile coalition partners–the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—withdrew their support to the government. During the floor test held on June 5 JSP-Nepal lawmaker Saroj Kumar Yadav, the immediate past chief minister of the province, fell 4 votes short from securing the position. When he garnered 50 votes in support, 53 members voted against him. In the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister has to secure at least 54 votes in support.Upendra Yadav's parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, continuously led the provincial government for almost seven years until Satish Kumar Singh of the Janamat Party dethroned Yadav’s party from the chief ministerial position on June 7.Though the recent party split and the dethroning of the Madhesh Province’s leadership can be blamed on the party leadership, according to analysts, the unity general convention poses little challenge to Yadav. Because of the split, there are no leaders left in the party who’d challenge Yadav, Chandra Kishore, an observer of Madhesh politics, told the Post. “Therefore, the general convention should be a walk in the park for him.” The party that held its statute convention last year adopted a policy of lobbying for a directly elected presidential system in the country. Likewise, the Madhesh-based party set the goal of fighting for a parliament with fully proportional representation. This is expected to direct policy at the unity convention. However, experts question the sustainability of the policies adopted by the statute convention in the party's post-split situation.“The policies adopted by the statute convention will remain intact,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “The party division, which is sub judice in the Supreme Court, will not impact policy changes.”Chandra Kishore, who has been following Madhesh politics for a long time, differs from Adhikari.“Yadav is a political strategist. He acts as per the situation,” he said. “He will not necessarily act as per the party documents.” The JSP-Nepal’s central committee in January, two months before the split, decided to hold the unity general convention in June. The party decided to organise the convention in order to consolidate the unity between various Madhes-based parties over time, party leaders said.This is the first unity convention held after the merger of various Madhes-based parties, Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson for the JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, led by Mahantha Thakur; the Rastriya Madhesh Samajbadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari; the Tarai Madhesh Sadbhawana Party, led by Mahendra Yadav’ the Sadbhawana Party, led by Rajendra Mahato; the Madheshi Janadhikar Ganatantrik Party, led by Raj Kishor Yadav; and Anil Jha’s Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged to form the Rastriya Janata Party before the 2017 general and provincial elections.The Rastriya Janata Party and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party led by Upendra Yadav fought the 2017 elections with a tie-up in Madhesh but merged the parties in 2020 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. When the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli issued an ordinance to split the Yadav-led party to counterbalance a rift within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed after the merger of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) following the 2017 election, the merger in the two Madhesh-based parties was hastened. Before this, the only Madheshi party to hold the general convention periodically was the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Gajendra Narayan Singh, who formed the Nepal Sadbhabana Council in 1985, turned the council into a party following the first people’s movement of 1990.Yadav’s will be another Madhesh-based party to hold the general convention more than once, Suman said.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates a political party to hold its general convention at least once in five years. However, if the office bearers cannot be elected in five years due to a situation arising out of special circumstances, based on the statute of a political party, new leaders can be elected within six months thereafter. The constitutional time frame is not mandatory for a new party or one formed after a split. As Nepal’s regional parties often suffer splits, they rarely hold the general convention periodically.The Upendra Yadav-led Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) held its second convention in 2009, in Birgunj, just after the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The MJF was a rights-based organisation before it entered politics after the first Madhesh uprising of 2007. JSP-Nepal spokesperson Suman said Yadav has led various political parties, but this is the second time an outfit he leads is holding the general convention.The Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar-led Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (Loktantrik) held its first general convention in Biratnagar in May 2016. The same year, Nepal Sadbhawana Party also held its general conventions in April.The JSP-Nepal has invited foreign dignitaries to the unity convention. The party's foreign affairs department chief, Arjun Thapa, said delegates from India, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Spain, and Indonesia have already arrived in Nepal.Invitations have been extended to various parties, except the Janata Samajbadi Party led by Ashok Rai, which splintered from the JSP-Nepal. The Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoist Centre, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) are other parties that will participate in the Janakpur convention. Party leaders say the opening ceremony will be held on Monday, whereas the closed session, which will discuss the party’s political documents, is scheduled for the subsequent days. \nNepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa has joined the group of leaders calling for a constitutional amendment in order to address the underperforming provincial system and the political instability allegedly caused by the mixed electoral system the country constitutionally endorsed nearly a decade ago. After a change in coalition at the centre began to affect provincial governments, voices for reforming the electoral system through constitutional amendment are growing louder. Speaking at a programme in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, a general secretary of the largest party in the House of Representatives, argued that reforming the electoral system had become necessary to ensure political stability. He also said that the provinces’ performance so far shows that the federal system cannot be sustained in its current form. “By reform in the provincial structure, I do not mean scrapping the federal system altogether, which the country cannot afford,” Thapa told the Post when asked to explain his statement. “The issue of governments’ formation in the provinces has been challenged in court. This is a result of lack of clarity on provincial government formation in the constitution.”The government formation process in Koshi and Gandaki provinces have been challenged multiple times, and the Supreme Court has many times invalidated the chief ministerial appointment and election processes in the two provinces.Questions have been raised over the expenditures for running the provincial governments. “To address this issue, we need to downsize the elected representatives’ bodies not only in the provinces but also at the federal level. For that, we need constitutional reform,” Thapa added. “We bear a collective responsibility to protect and sustain the constitution. This, however, requires some amendments. Reform in the electoral system is as important,” Thapa emphasised. The provinces followed the same process of government formation practised at the centre and that caused problems, he said. Thapa stressed that amendments to the constitution could address all these issues.The Congress leader says it is wrong to advocate either for scrapping the federal system altogether or and fully retaining the constitutional provisions on the provinces. The Rastriya Prajantara Party, which bats for the revival of the Hindu Kingdom, has been demanding the scrapping of the country’s federal structure. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which was formed two years ago, also wants the provincial structure overhauled. The new party says it wants to downsize the middle layer of the federal system. The party hasn’t participated in the provincial elections.Former National Assembly member Khim Lal Devkota, who is also an expert on federalism and a columnist at The Post, sees a slim chance of any changes in the federal system even though “it is necessary”.“I have closely worked with Nepal’s top political leaders. I believe they won’t readily amend the constitution,” Devkota told the Post. “The longer we take to amend the constitution, the more questions there will be on the longevity of the constitution.” During the Congress Mahasamiti meeting held in February, many leaders raised their voices in favour of filling all seats of the lower house of the federal parliament through direct election. Instead of electing a section of the lower house under the Proportional Representation (PR) system, the leaders had suggested that the upper house of the parliament be filled exclusively through the PR system. They were of the view that Nepal would not have a stable government unless all the lower house members were directly elected by their constituencies.Devkota is also of the opinion that Nepal needs to reform the election system. The mixed electoral system should be changed to create an environment for political instability, he said.In the 275-strong federal lower house, 165 are directly elected, whereas 110 come from the PR category. The upper chamber has 59 members. Of them, 56 are chosen through an electoral college comprising provincial assembly members and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units. Each province elects eight members, while three are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers.Likewise, among the 550 members in the seven provincial assemblies, 220 are elected under the PR category. This number is large compared to the population size and thus needs to be reduced significantly, say experts.However, Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, blames the political leaders for the current problems of the provinces. Top politicians are using provincial governments and assemblies to place their second- and third-tier leaders. This has burdened the state without yielding any tangible results, he added. Pokharel says this represents a failure of the leadership rather than the federal system.Since the inception of the provincial system, political parties have appointed chief ministers on a rotational basis, Pokharel told the Post. “It is true that there are operational problems in the provinces, but leaders are more responsible for this than the system.” Even though the state structure is federal, political parties have yet to adopt the three-tier system within their organisations, he said. “What stops the political parties from giving autonomy to their provincial committees and letting them make decisions regarding the provinces on their own?” Pokharel questioned.Devkota, however, said two models should be considered to ensure the stability of provincial governments.The first involves distributing the government leadership positions based on the number of seats won in the election, and the second concerns implementing provisions similar to those at the local government level. According to the first model, the chief minister and other positions are distributed based on the number of seats shared in the provincial assembly elections, and the government is run among the constituent parties on a consensus basis.As per the second method, the chief minister is directly elected by voters, similar to the election of mayors or chairs at the local units. This makes the chief ministers fully accountable to the people. The chief minister can be removed by a two-thirds majority of the provincial assembly, thus preventing one from being an autocrat. One of the major concerns is the destabilising linkage of provincial politics with the power equation in Kathmandu. When the coalition at the centre changes, governments in the provinces also change.The subnational governments changed immediately after the change in coalition partners in Kathmandu on March 4. When Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal changed ruling partners, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives, CPN-UML, joined the government while the largest force, the Congress, was ousted from power. The changes at the centre immediately triggered changes in the provinces as well. \nFive years after submission, the government unveiled the long-awaited report of the High-Level National Education Commission, which includes recommendations for transforming private schools into trusts to curb commercialization and allocating a minimum of 20% of the budget to education.\nPolice arrested two individuals in Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency from CTEVT lab using 64 desktops and a server.\nCIB arrests 3 cooperative operators for embezzling Rs74 million after promising depositors attractive interest rates.\nKathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah's New Road sidewalk expansion plan, opposed by the UML-led federal government, gains support from the Nepali Congress, escalating a conflict involving land swap allegations and questions about federalism.\nTwo unidentified bodies, a woman and a man, were found at the bottom of a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, with a crashed motorcycle nearby suggesting an accident.\nWith the monsoon just around the corner, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has finally started repairing the Sisdole road that leads to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district. Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nHard Rock Cafe® Kathmandu's \"The Himalayan Burger\" has been ranked among the top five in Hard Rock International’s prestigious World Burger Tour.

The scheme aims to promote sustainable growth in developing countries by using a more generous trade preferences scheme than with other trade partners.The scheme applies to 65 countries, which fall into three tiers of preferences. Each category has increasing levels of preferential market access for the countries, meaning that the LDCs get the most generous treatment. The scheme has received a largely positive response, despite some criticism that it did not differ enough from its GSP initiative.Officials at the ministry said that during the meeting, Bhandari requested the British government to increase the technical assistance targeted for industry and export, which will help the export growth of Nepal.The meeting also discussed intellectual property rights protection and promotion and bilateral trade and investment between the countries.The minister expressed commitment to expanding British government partnerships in sectors like interconnection, infrastructure development, energy, trade, tourism, investment, and public-level issues. He also called for Nepal’s readiness to benefit from the UK's experience, knowledge, skill, and technology for the development of industry, hydropower, and education.During the meeting, Ambassador Fenn said that the UK is willing to work with the private sector and stay close to the government on its development. He committed to supporting the promotion of Nepali exports. Citing the UK's support for a free economy, he said the country will play a major role in connecting Nepal with the global market.Trade experts, however, argue that developed countries should continue the trade preference facilities during the transition period.Chandra Ghimire, former secretary at the industry ministry, said that developed countries like the UK need to continue duty-free quota-free market access for LDC graduates during the transition phase or for at least 8 to 10 years.“This will help the country’s exports do better and prevent the country from experiencing market shocks. For this, Nepal needs to actively negotiate with the market countries.”Nepal has two and a half years to graduate from the LDC, but the government's work to date is not sufficient, Ghimire said. “The country's national strategy to graduate from LDC is not as comprehensive as it should have been, it is implemented slowly, and it has always been challenging.”According to the Department of Customs, the total trade between Nepal and the UK increased by 16.21 percent in the last fiscal year, 2022-23, which ended in mid-July, from the previous fiscal year.Nepal’s exports to the UK increased by 6.73 percent to Rs3.33 billion in the review period, while imports increased by 21.57 percent to Rs5.33 billion. The country’s trade deficit with the UK remained at Rs2.20 billion.According to a report, ‘Nepal’s graduation from the LDC category, the implication for international trade and development cooperation,’ published by South Asia Watch of Trade, Economics and Environment in September 2022, Nepal’s merchandise exports could fall by 2.5 percent to 4 percent as a result of increased tariffs upon graduation. Exports to the European Union (EU) are expected to see the largest losses, assuming that Nepali exports will face ordinary GSP instead of GSP+. Getting GSP+ will significantly reduce export losses in the EU.The tariff increase analysis, coupled with the existing estimates of the impact on exports, underscores the importance of securing access to the GSP+ and GSP Enhanced Framework(EF) schemes in the EU and the UK, respectively. The EU’s newly proposed GSP for the period 2024-34 requires the ratification and effective implementation of 32 international agreements, adding five agreements to the current 27 international conventions. Nepal has to ratify and implement 27 conventions to be eligible for the UK’s Export Finance scheme, the same as with the EU's current GSP+ scheme.According to the report, LDC graduation will have not only tariff implications but also more stringent rules of origin provisions in preference-granting countries, including the EU, the UK, Canada, Australia, and the Russian Federation, among others.Many products, particularly apparel and made-up textile products, will face more stringent rules of origin in the form of double transformation requirements compared to the single transformation required for the LDCs, the report said.Readymade garment exporters express concerns that they may not be able to meet the more restrictive rules of origin requirements even if the alternative preference schemes offer preferential tariffs.Trade experts have been saying that Nepal may lose a huge European market as it might not get facilities under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative. This scheme grants full duty-free and quota-free access to the European Union Single Market for all products (except arms and ammunition).“We might need to go for a GSP+, but it is not easy to get as some criteria like ratifying convention of ILO, which the country has yet to do, and the rules of origin criteria are also not easy,” Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary told the Post in a recent interview.GSP is a special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance. GSP+ slashes these same tariffs to zero percent for vulnerable low- and lower-middle-income countries that implement 27 international conventions related to labour and human rights, environmental and climate protection, and good governance. \nIn February 1984, Maciej Berbeka and Maciej Pawlikowski of Poland became the first people to climb Cho Oyu, the sixth-highest mountain in the world, from the Nepal side.The mountain, which straddles the Nepal-China border, lies 20 km west of Everest. The 8,201-metre peak was first scaled in winter from the southeast pillar. The caravan route was Kathmandu-Lukla-Namce-Gokyo and Cho Oyu base camp.After three years, in May 1987, Ang Phuri Sherpa became the first Nepali to reach the peak from the Nepal side. It was in spring. Then a group of Russian climbers summited the peak in the autumn of 1991, followed by two Japanese in 1994.The last time Cho Oyu was conquered was in the spring of 2009, when Denis Urubko and Boris Dedeshko of Kazakhstan reached its top. After a decade and a half, a seven-member Sherpa team, including a French national, reached the summit last week. Cho Oyu is considered one of the most accessible 8,000ers from the Chinese side, while the Nepal side is considered among the toughest.Only 21 people have reached Cho Oyu from Nepal’s side in the past 70 years. By contrast, more than 4,000 have successfully climbed the mountain from the Tibetan side. This makes Cho Oyo the second most climbed eight-thousander after Everest.Among the 8,000ers, Cho Oyu has the lowest death rate.On June 7, the French Alasdair McKenzie, with Gelje, Tenging Gyaljen and other sherpas, stood atop Cho Oyu at 8:35 pm via the southwest ridge. The caravan route was Kathmandu-Lukla-Namche-Thame and Cho Oyu base camp.Unlike past expeditions, last week’s climb was meant to prepare a permanent route for a commercial expedition from the Nepal side.“With this success, Cho Oyu has become more accessible from Nepal, heralding a new era in Nepali mountaineering and inspiring future expeditions to tackle its challenging routes,” said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks, the agency which explored the local route. Nepal boasts of eight of the 14 highest peaks over 8,000m on the planet. They are Everest, Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, Cho Oyu and Annapurna. But to climb Cho Oyu, climbers usually had to go to Tibet first.“From now onwards, commercial expeditions will happen from the Nepal side. This is good news for all expedition agencies. Climbers will no longer need to go through a long process of getting permission from the Tibetan authority. All eight mountains above 8,000 are now accessible from the Nepal side,” said Mingma.Last Friday, the team started the summit push at 2:00 am from Camp IV, and after a relentless effort of over 18 hours, they made it to the top. “This remarkable achievement was the result of a meticulously planned expedition that started in March and commenced in the first week of May from Lukla,” said Mingma.According to Mingma, a commercial expedition on Cho Oyu may last 60 days and could cost a foreigner between $25,000 and $30,000.“That’s obviously a welcome development. It will create more jobs on the mountain,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. “But it’s too early to say whether the route will be a commercial success,” he said. For instance, the operating cost incurred from the Nepali side is nearly double that from the Tibetan side, in addition to the challenges a vertical wall poses.Transporting goods from Kathmandu to the Cho Oyu base camp would cost $5 per kg. However, as the road reaches the advanced base camp or camp above the base camp of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side, the cost on that route would be $2 per kg.“There is a lot of difference in the operating costs. Climbing from the Tibetan side would cost $13,000 a person,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa. “So, obviously, the climber's preference would be the Tibetan side. First due to the lower factor, and, second, it’s an easier climb from the north.”The success of the new route will depend on its commercial feasibility.Mingma said Cho Oyu’s Nepal side is known for its steep, vertical walls rising thousands of metres, making it one of the greatest present-day challenges. He, however, said once the route becomes commercial, competition will bring down the cost.“More than that, foreigners do not need to wait weeks or even months for the Tibetan authority’s permit to climb.”The story of the first expedition, from the Tibetan side, however, is more interesting.According to the archive of Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, Cho Oyu was first chosen for an expedition in 1952 in preparation for an Everest ascent the following year.The first attempt of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side was made by a British party led by Eric Shipton, with Edmund Hillary, George Lowe, Charles Evans, and Tom Bourdilon as its members. However, technical difficulties at an ice cliff above 6,650m forced them to give up the climb.According to the archive, the expedition, led by the British Eric Shipton, was estimated to take two weeks. “It would also mean entering the Tibetan territory, which it is believed Shipton was unwilling to do,” according to the archive.It was Shipton who first measured Cho Oyu as the sixth-highest mountain in the world.An Austrian expedition, led by Herbert Tichy, arrived in Birgunj in 1954 via India and flew into Kathmandu on an Indian airliner of the time. Once they were packed and ready, they moved to Bhaktapur, from where the long trek to the mountain would begin.There were only three foreign climbers and eleven sherpas on the team.Cho Oyu was finally climbed on October 19, 1954, via the northwest ridge in Tibet by Tichy, Joseph Jöchler and Pasang Dawa Lama.Before Cho Oyu, Everest and Annapurna in Nepal, and Nanga Parbat in Pakistan had been climbed. \nAt least one case of cholera, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, has been confirmed in Kathmandu.According to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, a 62-year-old man from Makwanpur district, who had been admitted with severe diarrhoea some two weeks ago, tested positive for the deadly disease.The man is said to have been residing in Kathmandu for a long time.“The health condition of the patient was serious when he was brought to our hospital,” said a health worker serving at the Hospital’s Emergency Department, asking not to be named, as the official was not authorised to speak to the media. “The stool test confirmed a cholera infection.”According to health workers at the hospital, Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in stool samples of infected patients.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.The Kathmandu Valley witnessed a massive cholera outbreak in the monsoon of 2022 in which 77 cholera-positive cases were confirmed. Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months.Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home. Only serious cases end up in hospitals.”Meanwhile, officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that they are unaware of any confirmed cholera cases in the district. “We don’t have information about a cholera outbreak in recent days,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office in Kathmandu. “We are the agency responsible for investigating the causes of outbreaks of deadly diseases, and as of today (Friday) we don’t have such information.”Sapkota informed that one case of cholera infection was reported from Sitapaila in Kathmandu about three months ago. An Indian national who is a truck driver was admitted to the Sukraraj Hospital at that time.“We had mobilised our team to investigate the source of the outbreak,” said Sapkota. Doctors warn that concealing outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and failing to investigate their sources and inform the public about the risks can prove counterproductive, as the deadly bacteria keep spreading in communities if preventative measures are not taken.Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected with them every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main catalysts for the spread of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City that were highly affected by the outbreak. In October 2021, a Vibrio cholera outbreak in several local units of Kapilvastu district killed at least four people including three minors—boys aged seven and two, and a five-year-old girl. Another deceased was a 45-year-old man.Following the outbreak, the Health Ministry had launched a mass vaccination drive against the disease after all its attempts failed to curb the infection.The World Health Organisation says that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors say launching awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from dying of water-borne diseases, including cholera.A combination of careful survey, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nPost-monsoon is considered the dengue epidemic season. However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.“Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.”Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said.Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death. \nPolio vaccination in the Tarai region is being affected by severe heat, with at least 1.46 million children at risk of infection as the campaign is paused due to school closures.\nThe 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births. Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nNepal restricted South Africa to a lowly total of 115 runs in Group D match of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup being held at the Arnos Vale Ground, West Indies.Sent to bat first, the Group D leaders struggled to put points together as Nepal’s Kushal Bhurtel and Dipendra Singh Airee shone with the ball.Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 tuns off 11 balls before being dismissed by Airee in 3.4 overs.Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs, and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after.Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks stood his ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavillion by Airee in 15.3 overs.Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play.Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-0ver spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs.South Africa have already reached the Super Eight stage after heavy rain in Florida led to the abandonment of the Nepal-Sri Lanka match on June 11.Nepal lost to the Netherlands in their opening game and sit in the fourth position with one point. But they still have a chance to progress to the Super Eight if they win both of their remaining matches—against South Africa and Bangladesh. \nNepal can finally breathe a sigh of relief and will have at least something to cheer for when they return home from Saudi Arabia—thanks to a spirited battle against a strong Yemen.The Gorkhalis headed into their last Group H game of the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers against Yemen on Tuesday low in confidence after losing all of their previous five matches, with their most recent embarrassment coming in a 4-0 drubbing by group winners United Arab Emirates last week.Vincenzo Alberto Annese’s men had conceded 18 goals in five qualifiers matches, scoring none in reply.Nepal’s dismal qualifiers campaign was also partly contributed by the sheer negligence of sports authorities All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) and National Sports Council whose poor management of the country’s only international standard football venue—Dasharath Stadium—forced Nepal to play their two home matches at neutral venues.However, on Tuesday, they floored Yemen with a dogged fightback until the death after initially falling behind to a ninth minute Nasser Al Gahwashi penalty at the Prince Mohammad bin Fahd Stadium in Dammam, thanks to Sanjeeb Bista and Gillespye Jung Karki whose goals either side of the half time turned things around for Nepal.Although Mohammed Al Dahi’s equaliser in the first minute of stoppage time denied them a first victory of the qualifiers and also a first win against Yemen, their dogged display will still serve as a testament that the youth Nepali squad have a lot of potential.The draw against Yemen will especially wash the burden off the Italian coach Annese whose contract with Nepal is expiring this month.Annese, who was appointed as Nepal head coach in March last year, has been under a sharp knife following a series of disappointing results that also included a draw against minnows Bhutan, disappointing SAFF Championship campaign and World Cup Qualifiers first round struggles against Laos.The 39-year-old coach has been using the exodus of Nepali football stars including Bimal Gharti Magar and Sujal Shrestha to Australia and an inexperienced squad as his defence for Nepal’s poor run of results in the international arena.But he seems to have finally cracked the code in his probably last game with Nepal as coach. And the output against Yemen could possibly convince ANFA to trigger another extension in his contract. ANFA had added a three-month extension in Annese’s contract this year.The emergence of Sanjeeb, who only made his international debut in March this year as an 88th minute substitute during a 5-0 qualifiers loss to Bahrain, is even more promising.Sanjeeb, who played full 90 minutes in Nepal’s 3-0 loss against Bahrain before being benched in 4-0 defeat to the UAE, had a hand in both of Nepal’s goals against Yemen in Dammam.Sanjeeb, who replaced star forward Anjan Bista in the front, first pounced on a misplaced back pass from Radhawan Al Hubaishi and bent the ball past Yemen goalkeeper Mohammed Khairalah to score an equaliser in the 22nd minute.Sanjeeb then received a long pass from Chhiring Lama and served it for Karki to head home Nepal’s second goal in the 66th.It was the first international goals for both Sanjeeb and Karki. Karki made his debut for Nepal in September last year during Nepal’s goalless draw with Myanmar. The evening was also memorable for Nepal captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Playing his 100th international match, the 34-year-old goalkeeper produced a string of stunning saves to keep Yemen at bay till the final moments and helped Nepal earn a point.Even though Nepal failed to reach the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and could not directly qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup, they still have a chance to secure their spot in their maiden Asian Cup through Asian Cup Qualification which will be played between March 25, 2025 to March 31, 2026.Top two teams from each nine groups qualified for the third round of 2026 FIFA World Cup and also secured a direct berth to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, China, Oman, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Indonesia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Australia and Palestine progressed.The 18 nations who failed to advance (India, Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Chinese Taipei, Turkmenistan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Philippines, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Nepal, Lebanon and Bangladesh) will compete in the 24-team AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers, with only six teams making it to the Asian Cup finals.Bhutan, the Maldives and Laos will join them in the third round of Asian Cup Qualification as the best ranking losing teams of the first round. The winners of the Asian Cup Qualifiers playoffs between Sri Lanka and Cambodia, Timor-Leste and Mongolia and Brunei Darussalam and Macau will also be in the competition. \nNepal and Sri Lanka shared a point each after heavy rain in Florida and waterlogged outfield at the Central Broward Stadium in Lauderhill led to the abandonment of their T20 World Cup Group D match on Tuesday.The outcome means Group D leaders South Africa became the first team in the 20-team tournament to progress to the Super Eight stage. The Proteas are unbeaten and have won all three matches they have played. They have six points from three games.The result also leaves former champions Sri Lanka without a win after three games and puts the Lankans on the brink of elimination from group stage. Sri Lanka lost their opening games to South Africa and Bangladesh. They face the Netherlands in Gros Islet in their final group game on Monday but may find themselves already out of the tournament by then.Nepal lost to the Dutch in their opening game and sit in the fourth position with one point. But they still have a chance to progress to the Super Eight if they win both of their remaining matches. They play against South Africa on Saturday and Bangladesh on Monday.Bangladesh and the Netherlands are tied on two points but the Tigers occupy the second spot due to net run rate. Both of them have two matches in hand. \nSouth Korea and US officials discuss emergency response to a possible North Korea visit by Russian President Putin, with concerns over military cooperation and regional stability being raised.\nG7 leaders agreed to provide $50 billion to Ukraine from frozen Russian assets, strengthened security with Ukraine, expressed concerns over China, Gaza, and the Middle East, and discussed artificial intelligence, economic development, and potential leadership changes.\nChina experiences drought in multiple provinces due to a prolonged lack of rainfall and extreme heat, prompting government responses to mitigate impacts on agriculture, water, and energy supplies, while southern China faces heavy rainfall warnings.\nG7 leaders gather to bolster Ukraine support, confront China's ambitions, and address global challenges amidst domestic turmoil.\nForeign book publishers do not authorize Nepali publishers to translate their books, leading to the widespread availability of unauthorized translations of popular works in Nepal, harming authors, publishers, and readers.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe Constitution of Nepal defines health as a fundamental right, stating that every citizen is entitled to free basic health services. However, due to high costs, over half a million Nepalis are deprived of primary healthcare. The country has 7,221 public health facilities, including 125 hospitals, 205 primary health care centres, 395 ayurvedic hospitals, 3,870 health posts and 2,626 community health centres and private health institutions. Despite this wide healthcare structure, the system still struggles to provide accessible and affordable healthcare services to the entire population. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that poverty increases by 2 percent every year due to high out-of-pocket expenditure (OOP) on health services from the private sector. In Nepal, the OOP constitutes 57.7 percent of the current health expenditure, while the government’s share is only 22.6 percent. Nepal has introduced schemes such as the Social Security Fund, the Employee Provident Fund, and the National Health Insurance Programme (NHIP), as well as enterprise private insurance, free healthcare, conditional cash transfer programmes, and improvised citizen programmes to reduce OOP and improve accessibility. However, the effectiveness of these schemes still remains in question. An appropriate pre-financing mechanism is needed to reduce the uncertainty of health illness and the catastrophic cost associated with healthcare. Nepal Government introduced the National Insurance Programme in 2016 to comply with the constitution and work towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030, a vital aspect of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UHC ensures access to quality healthcare without financial hardships. The target of SDG8 has two indicators: Coverage of essential healthcare services and financial protection for all. Low insurance coverageThe NHIP was designed to offer quality care at a minimal cost, guided by legal and policy frameworks to achieve the UHC. It was initially piloted in three districts—Kailali, Baglung and Illam. Despite a favourable policy environment, coverage and retention are not up to the mark, with only 23 percent enrollment and a significant dropout of 25 percent, which is a serious concern. Coverage is uneven, with Koshi province achieving 42 percent coverage while Madhesh lags at 8 percent. The programme also inadequately covers only 26 out of 77 districts of ultra-poor citizens. Although the NHIP aims to cover the nationwide population by 2030, numerous challenges lie ahead.The NHIP faces several barriers, including epidemiological and geographical limitations, limited risk pooling, stagnant financing, lack of financial sustainability assessment, difficulty in seeking referral services, inadequate local-level empanelment of health facilities, limited digitalisation of the NHIP functions and insufficient government ownership. To improve the NHIP and move towards universal healthcare, Nepal can learn about successful health insurance programmes of other countries. Lessons from elsewhereEvery country has a different insurance system to achieve universal healthcare goals. Japan uses a single-payer system where the government is the sole payer for healthcare services. By centralising the payment through the government, Japan has control over healthcare costs and maintains high standards of care. It is designed to provide universal health coverage and ensure accessibility of healthcare services to all people. Singapore uses a hybrid system where individual responsibility is balanced with government support. This approach aims to provide comprehensive coverage while maintaining sustainability and encouraging accountability in healthcare expenditures. Rwanda’s community-based health insurance programme mandates participation, particularly targeting rural and poor populations. The premium rates are progressive, i.e., based on income levels, ensuring the poorer individual pays less. Thailand has significantly improved health insurance coverage through contributions from civil servants and voluntary participation from those in the informal sector. Civil servants contribute to the system as part of their employment benefits, and for those in the informal sector, voluntary schemes are available, encouraging broader participation. This mixed approach helps to expand coverage and promotes universal health coverage. The United Kingdom has a publicly funded health system that provides medical services to the entire population regardless of socioeconomic status. Nepal can learn from the benefits of a tax-funded system, which offers preventive, promotive and curative health coverage. RecommendationsThe provision of health insurance is in its early stages in Nepal, so revising the benefits package to make it more comprehensive and focusing on enrolling underserved populations in Karnali, Sudurpaschim and Madhesh is essential. Instituting mobile clinics, community-based initiatives and strategic infrastructure development can help overcome geographical barriers and provide equitable healthcare services. Developing a sustainability roadmap, exploring innovative financing mechanisms and increasing healthcare spending should be emphasised to meet international benchmarks. Digitalising NHIP activities can improve efficiency, transparency and service delivery. National surveys to determine the coverage gap are vital in assessing the drop-out rate and increasing sustainability. Strengthening the NHIP is crucial for Nepal’s goal of achieving universal health care. Addressing the identified challenges and implementing proposed recommendations can enhance the NHIP’s effectiveness, ensuring equitable access to quality healthcare. Addressing disparities in health outcomes and financing mechanisms is also crucial to improving overall population health and ensuring everyone has access to quality healthcare. Improving worker training and supervision and prioritising service provider education, quality assurance, and preventive care could strengthen NHIP care. Enhancing rural healthcare accessibility is also necessary for health insurance. The government has increased the budget for the insurance programme, but its share of total health sector spending remains low compared to international benchmarks. The World Health Organization predicts that allocating 5 to 6 percent of GDP or 10 percent of the national budget towards healthcare will effectively cap out-of-pocket expenses. Despite this, Nepal consistently allocates below 5 percent of its national budget to healthcare. Increased funding in the healthcare system should be highly prioritised for the successful implementation of the NHIP.Sustainability issues can be addressed through social health insurance contributions and public-private partnerships. Continuous training and skill development for healthcare personnel can improve the quality of care. Performance-based payments can incentivise healthcare facilities to improve quality and efficiency. Using a mix of different funding methods instead of relying on just one is essential for providing universal healthcare and affordable healthcare services. A national health financing system should ensure every citizen can access healthcare when needed and protect families from financial catastrophe by covering out-of-pocket expenditures. Comprehensive governance and regulatory reform strategies are required to improve the scope, accessibility, quality, and sustainability of national health insurance coverage.  \nThey are everywhere. Sweeping floors in the homes of the wealthy, serving tea at stands, begging outside shopping malls, cleaning car windshields, working in brick kilns, and tilling the soil.Pakistan has several pieces of legislation that deal with child labour and yet millions of children are exploited and put to work in full view of the rest of us. It is estimated that Pakistan has over 12 million children who are victims of child labour.According to data compiled in 2021, the vast majority of these children are working in the agricultural sector, helping with planting and harvesting wheat and cotton. They also work in the deep sea fishing and poultry sectors. In the industrial sector, they make glass bangles, amongst other occupations. Other hazardous occupations, sometimes claiming their health and life, are coal and gemstone mining.Around 1.5m are forced to beg, while thousands are exploited as sex workers. These are damning, but not shocking, facts. There is no one in Pakistan who does not encounter small children working around them every single day. We have many laws that pretend to address the problem, but the fact that almost none of them are enforced reveals that there is widespread public acceptance of children being put to work. This is a reprehensible situation and a moral indictment of an entire country.In this atmosphere of apathy and disinterest in making things better, a few grassroots activists are trying to make a difference in the lives of these poor and exploited children. One such activist is a woman farmer called Shagufta Yasmeen.According to Shagufta, when children come to work in the fields, they are often harvesting wheat or cotton. This brings the children into contact with very strong and harmful pesticides that are being sprayed on the crop. Shagufta works with the EU-funded Clear Cotton Project, which is trying to raise awareness about the need to reduce child labour in the cotton fields and especially about the harms of pesticide exposure to children whose brains and bodies are still developing. Long-term exposure to pesticides has also been known to cause cancer and other debilitating conditions in children.In her report published in The Guardian last August, journalist Zofeen T Ebrahim asked, “How many more poor child workers must die in Pakistan before change happens?” It is a good question that has still not been answered almost a year later.In the report, the journalist recounts the death of 10-year-old Fatima Furiro who was found dead in a mansion in Khairpur. Her tortured body was later exhumed for autopsy. Furiro had been sent by her parents to work in the home of Pir Asad Ali Shah Jeelani. The postmortem confirmed that the little domestic worker had been tortured, raped and abused over a protracted period of time. Videos showing an injured Fatima struggling to sit up before collapsing went viral.Of all the child workers whose childhood and innocence are trashed when they are sent to work, little girls working in domestic settings are perhaps the most vulnerable. Educated and wealthy members of society, who otherwise espouse a great commitment to charity and to being good Muslims, regularly ignore the exploitation of these little girls, even though it takes place under their very noses every single day. Because these girls work in private spaces in the homes of people, they can easily be physically and sexually abused without any consequences for the perpetrator.In other cases, these little girl workers who are barely 10 or 11 years old themselves are employed as caregivers for small babies. As wealthy mothers’ shop, chat with friends, and eat at fancy restaurants these little girls trail them like slaves who are indentured to serve and cannot expect any just or fair treatment. Nearly everyone in cities like Karachi and Lahore has seen these little girls sitting on the side or the floor while the rest of the family enjoys a fancy meal without even thinking of feeding them.It is just this sort of dehumanisation, perpetrated by the well-educated and wealthy, that allows child labour to continue unchecked in the country. The reason that legislation, whose ostensible purpose is to end child labour and protect our young ones from the kind of brutality inflicted on little Fatima Furiro, is not implemented is because, in this land of inequality, there is no accountability of the wealthy and influential, who are, in fact, given a free pass after every atrocity they commit. When everyone thinks that exceptions can be made in the prohibition of child labour, tacit acceptance is created in society for this scourge: the children of the poor are seen as fair game when it comes to wanting things done very cheaply.The persistence of child labour and child exploitation in Pakistan is a moral issue. Despite all the commitments to goodness and charity and being faithful Muslims, people simply do not think that exploiting children is a condemnable act. This is why, even as we see children being beaten up, forced into begging, and kicked around in front of our very own eyes we do not raise our voices or punish the culprits.This extends to law enforcement and other government institutions that, too, look the other way when they should be catching and imprisoning the perpetrators, however rich and powerful.Everyone likes to condemn evil practices in theory but then they stay quiet and are, in fact, complicit in their perpetuation. Collectively, this is a moral indictment of an entire country, and reveals a deep ethical bankruptcy that sees little wrong in the failure to protect the most helpless and vulnerable in society.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nOn June 15th, Nepal's seven provinces will present unstable budgets amid challenges including frequent changes in leadership, inadequate police adjustment, reduced fiscal transfers, and limited provincial autonomy.\nWhen it arrives, it can bring both bounty and bane. However, due to a changing climate, monsoons in recent times have invariably resulted in more hardship than help. This monsoon, which arrived in Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual date, will certainly buoy farmers and provide much-needed relief from the blistering heat, but concerns over its severity still loom large. Experts have predicted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures. As this will exacerbate floods, landslides and epidemics, disaster preparedness becomes crucial.Our responses to natural disasters have consistently fallen short. Governments come and go, but the same pattern repeats every year, and hundreds of lives, and a whole lot of properties and physical infrastructure are left at nature’s mercy. Not that the country has no plans and policies for disaster preparedness. This year, as in previous ones, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has devised the Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan, which is commendable. The necessary logistics and emergency relief materials have also been stockpiled in all provinces, according to officials. The problem, however, is with the execution of these plans. This monsoon is estimated to put 1.81 million people and 412,000 households at risk, and require 18,000 rescues. These numbers are large, suggesting the necessity for a comprehensive response to disasters and ensuring that relief programmes reach the most vulnerable and needy. Lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels has also caused several problems during disasters. Local governments play a big role as primary rescuers in floods and landslides, but they are still far short in human and financial resources. The examples from the earthquake-devastated Rukum West, Sindhupalchowk and several other places highlight how Nepal fails to rehabilitate the disaster-displaced people for long periods. The residents of Rukum West are still obliged to live in houses with cracks and fissures, and experts warn that these houses could be badly damaged this monsoon. There is also high risk to those living in high landslide and flood prone areas. Unless we design approaches that include not only immediate relief programmes but also year-round relocation, rehabilitation, monitoring and study, people will continue to suffer. Also, proactive measures like public awareness and early warning should be strengthened.Moreover, monsoons are notorious for water- and vector-borne diseases, including dengue, cholera and typhoid. Dengue cases are already being reported from different parts of the country and the caseload will likely increase during and after the monsoon. Water resource contamination has surged in the past few months, leading to a higher number of water-borne disease cases in hospitals. During the monsoon preparedness, the authorities shouldn’t overlook these epidemics and focus particularly on areas that are more prone to diseases and, therefore, need timely healthcare intervention and workers.A coordinated effort from health, home, urban development and water supply ministries can help make this monsoon a lot safer. In the long run, we should find ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, which has exacerbated our climatic conditions and intensified disasters. Understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on weather will help us better prepare for future monsoons and the disasters that come in their wake.  \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal holds its general convention amidst party setbacks and scrutiny of Madhesh-based parties' performance and internal issues.\nPolitical instability in Nepal leads to frequent ambassador recalls, hindering diplomatic relations, affecting economic growth, and undermining Nepal's international standing.\nDespite adopting a federal system, Nepal's provinces face criticism due to centralized governance, provincial dependence on Kathmandu, lack of commitment to federalism, and flawed constitutional provisions, highlighting the need for improvements in implementation and mindset shifts.\nA parliamentary committee was formed to investigate the cooperative scam, despite disputes over including Deputy Prime Minister Rabi Lamichhane's name in its jurisdiction, with the probe focusing on misused funds and the involvement of individuals and companies, including Gorkha Media Network where Lamichhane invested money obtained from cooperatives.\nAmnesty International's Secretary General highlights global human rights backsliding, including shrinking civic space, weaponization of laws, increased police brutality, and impunity, affecting Nepal and other South Asian countries.\nThe CPN Unified Socialist, formed in 2021 due to a split in the CPN-UML, is preparing for its first general convention, facing criticism for poor electoral performance and a lack of service delivery despite being part of the government since its inception.\nThe UN's evolving role in Nepal's development and peace includes supporting Nepal's transition to LDC graduation, achieving SDGs, reducing poverty and inequality, addressing climate change, consolidating peace, and promoting Nepal's leadership on global platforms.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather with possible light to moderate rain and thunder/lightning in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki regions; partly cloudy to fair in rest of Nepal; with extreme heat warning in Tarai regions.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather and light to moderate rainfall with thunder and lightning are expected in parts of Nepal on Thursday, with Dhangadhi having recorded the highest temperature of 43.9 degrees Celsius on Wednesday.\nExtreme heat has gripped Nepal, with temperatures soaring above 45 degrees Celsius in some areas, while eastern districts experience relief from monsoon rains.\nPartially cloudy weather with scattered rain in some parts of Nepal, while other areas experience fair weather with temperatures ranging from 31°C in Kathmandu to 43.6°C in Nepalgunj.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAfter a long eighteen-year gap, Nepal and China are all set to hold boundary talks in Beijing next week. The meeting comes days ahead of the Nepal-China foreign secretary-level talks slated for June 25.Amrit Rai, foreign ministry spokesman, said the Joint Expert Group meeting next week will be led by the Director General of the Department of Survey. The meeting will take place on June 19 and 20 in Beijing.The Nepali delegation will include representatives from ministries including foreign affairs, home affairs, defence, and land management, cooperatives and poverty alleviation, as well as the Nepali Embassy in Beijing.According to Rai, the delegation led by Prakash Joshi, director general of the Department of Survey, will head for Beijing on Sunday.The Chinese team will be led by someone from the Department of Border and Ocean Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China.The last meeting of the Joint Expert Group was held in 2006 in Kathmandu. The mechanism mandates a joint inspection of the Nepal-China border, dispute resolution, and finalisation of the fourth protocol to be signed by the two sides. The third Nepal-China boundary protocol was signed in 1988.According to multiple officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, the meeting is expected to discuss the status of the Nepal-China boundary; the date for commencing a joint boundary inspection; disputes in Nepal-China border; and also the signing of the Border Management System, whose initial agreement was signed during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. The Chinese side has sent a copy of the border management agreement, which is now under the review of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, according to a joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.According to a senior official familiar with the matter, although the text of the Boundary Management System is yet to be released, it envisions forming two panels—a joint commission on boundary matters between Nepal and China, and a committee of boundary representatives to be led by competent authorities from the two countries.Nepal is yet to ratify the boundary management system.The joint secretary said the meeting will also discuss some outstanding issues, such as the timing and form of inspection, and whether it should start anew or resume from where it was left in 2006.“We should start a new joint inspection as a lot has changed on the ground,” Krishna Raj BC, former director general of the Department of Survey, told the Post. When BC was director general at the department in 2011, Nepal and China were all set to sign the fourth boundary protocol by addressing issues like the height of Mt Everest and the exact location of pillar number 57 in Dolakha district, among other things. But the government called off the meeting at the last moment, and the plan to sign the fourth boundary protocol stalled.Nepal and China concluded their first boundary talks in 1961 and signed the Boundary Protocol in 1963.The 1963 Joint Boundary Protocol has the provision of constituting three different mechanisms to deal with boundary issues—the Joint Inspection Team, Joint Expert Group, and Joint Inspection Committee. The mechanisms were enshrined in the Nepal-China Boundary Protocol signed between the two countries on January 20, 1963. Later Nepal and China renewed the Boundary Protocol in 1979 and 1988.While the Joint Expert Group is led by the director general of the Department of Survey from the Nepali side and their Chinese counterpart, the Joint Inspection Committee is led by the deputy director general or under secretary from the Department of Survey and their Chinese counterpart, as per the practice and provisions. Similarly, the joint inspection committee is led by the joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.“If we are going to hold the meeting after such a long time, we should start afresh,” said BC, who later became a government secretary. “We should shun the old position as we will sign the new protocol after jointly conducting a fresh inspection of the boundary.” BC also led the joint boundary inspection between Nepal and China, completed the task and was to leave for Xian, China, for the meeting, which was later called off by the Nepali side.One of the major boundary disputes between was over the height of Mt Everest, which was resolved in 2020 with the two sides jointly announcing the new height as 8,848.86 metres. But several other issues remain unresolved.Two officials from two different ministries said the Chinese side has been asking for homework time before conducting the joint boundary inspection, but the Nepali side has been insisting on resuming it promptly, arguing that no additional homework is needed.Officials from the foreign and land management ministries said the Chinese side is trying to tie up the boundary meeting, joint boundary inspection, and signing of the boundary protocol with the signing of the boundary management system, something which the Nepali side has long stalled.Chinese security personnel have numerous border outposts and have been actively patrolling the Nepal-China border and this makes it easier for them to conduct joint inspections, the officials said. Nepal has fewer border outposts compared to Chinese, but Nepal is still prepared for joint inspection, they said.“We should address both old and new boundary issues during the meeting, like those related to joint inspection and signing of boundary protocol. As far as I know, there were two unresolved points during our last meeting. If we are unable to resolve the disputed issues, they will be recorded in minutes and included in the protocol,” said BC.As per the boundary protocol, Nepal and China should conduct a joint boundary inspection every ten years and sign the updated protocol, but that has not happened. “That is why the Nepali side has been insisting on a joint inspection,” said a joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.We have several reports from the fields provided by the Armed Police Force (APF), said an under secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs.Likewise, A joint secretary at the Ministry of Land Management told the Post that joint inspection of the Nepal and China boundary is one of the toughest tasks. “This is due to the difficult geographical terrain, freezing cold, lack of infrastructure like roads and treacherous mountains where the surveyors need to climb up to 5,000 metres for measurements. These factors make joint inspection complicated and time-consuming. The work may take up to a year,” he saidAnother former official of the Department of Survey told the Post that on the Chinese side, there are fully-equipped border outposts every five kilometres along most stretches of the border, “but on our side, boundary inspection has never been the priority. The government does not allocate enough budget to protect and safeguard the border, be it north or south.” Back in July 2022, officials from Nepal and China had held a virtual talk where they decided to activate the existing boundary mechanisms through mutual consultation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on July 15, 2022. According to officials and experts, Nepal and China have a dispute over pillar number 57 in Dolakha district, which was a major bone of contention following the resolution of the height of Mt Everest in December 2020. Besides pillar no 57, disputes have often surfaced in Humla, Gorkha, and Kimathanka (Sankhuwasabha), which need to be resolved through joint inspection.In addition to resolving disputes, as per the boundary protocol, both sides should update the boundary status every 10 years.The Nepali side, during the official visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who is also the State Councilor of China, in March 2022, had proposed forming a mechanism in order to conduct joint inspection of the border and update the latest status. The Nepal-China border spans 1,439 kilometres. Toya Baral, who led the 2006 meeting of the Joint Expert Group in Kathmandu, recalled, “The 2006 meeting prepared the boundary map using the global positioning system. As far as I remember, there has been no such meeting between Nepal and China.”“After meeting with the Chinese, we conducted a joint inspection and prepared a digital map,” said Baral. “The mechanism was also tasked with repair and maintenance of boundary pillars.”“We had almost finalised the boundary works besides settling the height of Mt Everet, and resolving the dispute over marker no 57. Some damaged pillars were also repaired. The map was digitalised, and we were tasked with finding the old boundary maps and evidence to ensure accurate positioning,” said Baral.Despite Nepal government’s claims that the Nepal-China border is largely free from disputes, there are reports of several boundary-related issues like encroachment, fencing and wiring, illegal construction, missing border pillars, lack of maintenance of boundary markers, and use of high-level digital surveillances in the border by the Chinese side. Nepali security agencies deployed on the border reported these issues to the Ministry of Home Affairs.In October 2021, a panel led by joint secretary Jay Narayan Acharya of the Ministry of Home Affairs submitted a report to the ministry after inspecting the boundary status in Humla district and made several recommendations. The report called for jointly addressing boundary matters and issues with China. “There has been a practice of addressing such issues through Joint Inspection Team, Joint Expert Group and Joint Inspection Committee,” says the report. “That’s why there is a need to activate these mechanisms.”“Such sensitive and bilateral matters related to the border need to be addressed through a permanent mechanism, but it is found that no such initiative has been taken,” states the report.Boundary issues with China surface in Nepal occasionally, and different governments have treated the matter differently. After media reports in September 2020 said China was “illegally constructing nine buildings inside the Nepali territory,” then foreign minister Pradip Gyawali swiftly refuted these claims.The Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu also denied any boundary issues between Nepal and China. \nNepal outlawed child marriage in 1963.However, more than six decades later, the evil tradition is still in practice, due to which the country has been facing far-reaching and consequences, according to a report titled “Behavioural Determinants of Child Marriage and Adolescent Pregnancy In Nepal.The report of a study jointly carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council and the United Nations Children’s Fund from November 2022 to April 2023 and published in 2024 also states that the behavioural drivers of child marriage and adolescent pregnancy in Nepal are multifaceted and deeply intertwined with societal norms, economic conditions and cultural expectations. “Poverty, discriminatory practices and limited agency of adolescents, especially girls and in certain communities, contribute to early marriages,” reads the report. “Child marriage and adolescent pregnancy have for individuals, families and communities.”Participants noted severe consequences of child marriage, including adolescent pregnancy, malnutrition, uterine prolapse, infant mortality and mental health issues.According to the report, almost 20 percent of students expected to be in Grades 9 and 10 in Tripurasundari Municipality, Karnali Province, have left school due to marriage. Early marriage is nearly universal among Dalits in Dolpa district, with an almost 100 per cent prevalence rate, often leading to early pregnancies.The influence of family decisions, perceptions of physical attractiveness and the desire for independence also play a pivotal role in child marriage.These practices perpetuate cycles of poverty and underdevelopment, limiting the potential of young girls and hindering societal progress, the report noted. The impact on the health of young brides and their children is severe, with increased risks of pregnancy-related complications, malnutrition, infant mortality rates, uterine prolapse and long-term health consequences, it said. Additionally, the study also identified that the lack of comprehensive education and awareness, coupled with societal pressures and traditional beliefs, contribute to the perpetuation of these practices. The prevalence of teenage marriages and pregnancies is widespread, especially in marginalized communities across the country.According to the report of the study, child marriage also contributes to suicide in some cases. A few early-married couples reportedly ended their lives due to their parent’s refusal to accept their marriage.Researchers talked to a teacher from Jhapa, who recounted a young couple's suicide in a tea garden after their family pressured them to separate to preserve the family’s honour. Key persons in the Gurung and Kham Magar communities highlighted issues arising from miscommunication when a spouse works abroad. Instances of extramarital affairs or remarriage while away can also lead to family conflicts, occasionally resulting in suicides.Child marriage diminishes educational opportunities, causing many girls to drop out of school and restricting their empowerment. Adolescent girls from Muslim and Musahar communities told researchers that they felt discomfort attending school in traditional marriage attire, like bangles and kurtas, while their classmates wore school uniforms. Furthermore, the financial implications extend to the families involved, exacerbating economic challenges. The lack of education and job opportunities, along with the burden of raising a family, traps young couples in a cycle of poverty, according to the report. The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 conducted by the Ministry of Health and Population, shows that overall, 14 percent of women aged 15-19 have been pregnant, including 10 percent who have had a live birth, while two percent experienced a pregnancy loss.Teenage pregnancy is highest in Karnali Province, at 21 percent, followed by Madhesh Province, at 20 percent, Koshi and Gandaki Province, at 13 percent, and Lumbini Province, at 10 percent, according to the 2022 survey.The Health Ministry survey suggests that the decision to quit school may contribute to early pregnancy among young girls. The report states that 33 percent of girls aged between 15 and 19 with no formal education are more likely to start childbearing earlier than those with at least some secondary education, which stands at eight percent.Nepal has pledged to end child marriage by 2030 as part of its commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Constitution of Nepal.However, despite efforts to combat the practice, Nepal has the eighth-highest rate of child marriage in the world and the third-highest rate in South Asia. According to Nepal’s Civil Code, the minimum age for marriage is 20 for both women and men. As per Article 173 of the Criminal Code, anyone found guilty of either committing or arranging a child marriage faces up to three years in jail and a fine of Rs30,000. \nChildren aged between five and 11 years with compromised immunity will be administered the Covid vaccine, according to health officials.The Covax facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, has agreed to provide 100,000 doses of the children’s vaccine, and supply will start in the last week of June, according to officials at the Ministry of Health and Population.“These 100,000 doses are part of the 2.5 million doses, which Covax had agreed to supply to Nepal in 2024,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Children between five and 11 having underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.”Last month, Nepal confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country. All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new Covid cases in the last few months.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.The Covax facility supplied millions of doses of various brands of the coronavirus vaccine, which were used to inoculate the majority of the country's population.Officials said that Nepal will receive 1.6 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccine by the end of this month, including the children’s vaccine, from Covax. The rest of the doses of the monovalent vaccine to be received later will be administered to the adult population in all provinces of the country. The monovalent or single component is designed for the Omicron variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Earlier, the facility used to supply Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine doses that included a component of the original virus strain as well as a part of the Omicron variant to provide broad protection against Covid.The vaccine is called a bivalent Covid shot as it contains two components: the original virus strain and Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nWhen 24-year-old Samjhana Bishwakarma and her partner Jeshika Gautam sought to rent a place, they were rejected at the last moment when the homeowner knew about their sexual orientation. Everything was all but decided but then the homeowner became dodgy and they eventually had to find a new place to live in. “It was disheartening,” Bishwakarma says.Bishwakarma identifies herself as a lesbian woman, and her partner a masculine lesbian. They’ve been together for six years and have been living together in their current residence for three years. Their current homeowners know well about their relationship, and are accommodating of them. Despite the occasional weird looks, they have little to worry about. “It has been very fulfilling staying at this place because of everybody’s acceptance,” Bishwakarma says.Though Nepal is considered relatively progressive when it comes to queer rights, people from the queer community in the country are still subjected to prejudices and discrimination. And as a result, finding a place to rent can be an uphill battle, as it was for Bishwakarma and Gautam. They are often compelled to hide their relationship and lie to their homeowners and neighbours that they are either siblings or friends.So did 55-year-old Shila Gurung and his partner Sita Rana. In the beginning, they told their homeowners and neighbours that they were close friends living together. They reside in Nepalgunj, and have been living together for years now. Gurung is a transgender man.“After we came into contact with queer organisations and queer friends from all over Nepal, we gradually started to feel safe enough to embrace our relationship in society,” Gurung says. Things are starting to become better when it comes to accepting queerness and queer relationships, but acceptance from everybody fully is something that will definitely take time, Gurung adds.Recently, Nepal saw a few groundbreaking developments that guaranteed equal rights to gender and sexual minorities in the country. In June 2023, the Supreme Court ordered the registration of same-sex and non-heterosexual marriage and in November of the same year, Maya Gurung and Surendra Pandey became the first same-sex couple to register their marriage in South Asia.But the road to reach this point has been difficult for the community, and it still is on various fronts. In Surendra and Maya’s case, too, familial acceptance was lacking, and it took them years to register their marriage. Many queer couples in a live-in relationship hope to eventually get married and have their marriage legally registered, but despite existing laws, implementation remains subpar.Article 15 of the constitution forbids discrimination against anyone based on gender and sexual orientation. However, Bimala Gurung, programme coordinator at Mitini Nepal, says that prejudice against queer couples has manifested in many ways, and one of them is mistreatment by homeowners.“Sometimes, homeowners indirectly force their queer tenants to leave by stopping their fair supply of water or electricity,” Gurung says.Meanwhile, many queer couples choose to flee their homes when their family members refuse to accept them. In July last year, the Post reported that a young couple eloped together when one side of the family was adamantly homophobic. In another similar story, a lesbian couple, Pabitra Badi Nepali and Bimala BK, ran away at a young age to live together due to persistent familial pressure to split, and marry others. When they returned home with the intention of building a life together in their village, they were shunned and ridiculed by their villagers.In a society that resists queer romantic relationships, it is essential to create safe spaces for queer couples to live their life the way they want, experts say. Normalising queer live-in relationships and marriages is one step towards attaining that goal, they add.Twenty-three-year-old Sarita Ruchal and her partner had to be initially cautious of living together because of unsolicited questions directed towards her partner, who is a transgender man. When people would hear her partner talking, they would question his sexuality. They would tell him that he had a woman’s voice, while asking the couple how two women could live together. This was when they resided in Baneshwar, Kathmandu.Things have changed for the better, however. At their new place in Bauddha, their homeowner is entirely accepting of their relationship, and so are their neighbours. And the couple no longer feel the need to hide their relationship.“I think Nepali society has made some progress in accepting people from queer communities and queer relationships,” says Ruchal. “I am incredibly happy at my new place. We feel safe here.”Gurung, programme coordinator at Mitini Nepal, also agrees that increased awareness in urban areas has made people more empathetic towards the community. However, the concept of gender binary that believes romantic, sexual and marital relationships only occur between the opposite sexes is instilled in the fabric of society, she added.Experts suggest that to properly monitor instances of discrimination against queer communities—including mistreatment by homeowners—keeping a database of the number of queer couples in a particular ward and provinces could be valuable. Filing a police complaint could be an option to seek justice for those couples who were shunned by their families for their relationship, but that step may be long and difficult for the couples themselves.Queer individuals often seek counselling to combat the social discrimination they face on a daily basis, Gurung says. “Awareness is increasing,” she says. “But there still needs to be better work on the part of stakeholders and service providers for queer couples to enjoy their free will as any heterosexual couples.” \nNepal blew their chances of qualifying for the Super Eight of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup after losing to South Africa by a single run in a last-over nail-biter at the Arnos Vale Ground in West Indies.The Rhinos had everything on the line and were in need of two runs off the last ball of the game when Gulshan Jha was caught between the wickets by Quinton de Kock.Earlier, the Rhinos put up a great bowling display, restricting South Africa, who were sent to bat first, to a lowly total of 115 runs.Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 runs off 11 balls before being dismissed by Dipendra Singh Airee in 3.4 overs. Kushal Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after.Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks managed to stay on the ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavilion by Airee in 15.3 overs.Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play.Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-0ver spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs.Despite the easy chase, Nepal found themselves on the losing end, putting 114 runs at a loss of seven wickets at the end of the stipulated 20 overs.The Rhinos were off to a good start with openers Bhurtel and Aashif Sheikh building a decent first-wicket partnership. However, the tides turned quickly for Nepal as South Africa’s Tabraiz Shamsi struck twice in a single over, dismissing Bhurtel for 13 in 7.2 overs, and captain Rohit Paudel for a duck only two deliveries later.Sheikh stood undeterred, building a half-century partnership with Anil Sah to bring some much-needed relief to the Nepali innings. Sah scored 27 runs, which featured three boundaries and a six, before being caught by Marco Jansen off Aiden Markram.Just as the innings were steadying for the Rhinos, Shamsi struck again, proving a thorn in Nepal’s flesh. Nepal were in need of 18 runs off as many deliveries at the end of 16 overs when they dealt a massive blow, losing Dipendra Singh Aireec (6), Aasif Sheikh (42) and Kushal Malla (1) in a span of five balls.Tension ran high as Nepal were still in need of eight runs with an over to spare. Gulshan Jha, who took to the field at number seven, missed twice, narrowing the game down to eight runs with four deliveries in hand.Jha then smashed a boundary. The game was down to two runs off as many balls, but he missed again. With only a single delivery remaining, Jha and his partner Sompal Kami made the run for an equaliser, but the former was run out, ending Nepal’s hopes of competing in the World Cup.For South Africa, Tabraiz Shamsi grabbed four wickets while Aiden Markram also dismissed a Nepali batter. \nIn what looks like a perfect example of a circle of financial gain and loss, Nepal is sending a significant amount of money, much of which is earned through remittance, to foreign destinations every year to pay for the higher education of Nepalis. In the first nine months of the fiscal year 2023-24, which began in mid-July, the country sent out 95.85 billion rupees in foreign education alone. The figure could be even higher, as students and their guardians often find non-conventional or illegal mediums, including hundi, to transfer money abroad. What is alarming is that the official figures represent a 42.5 percent increase from the same duration in the last fiscal year, when students took Rs67.19 billion to spend on education abroad. In FY 2022-23, the total outgoing amount stood at Rs142 billion, a 48 percent rise from the Rs67.70 billion in FY 2021-22.Along with cash, the number of Nepali youths leaving home for education abroad is growing each year. In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, over 90,000 students have obtained the no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Education. The total figure for FY 2022-23 stood at over 110,000, while it was almost 113,000 in FY 2021-22. As per the Ministry of Education, the number of students obtaining NOC has tripled in the past decade. That these students start earning after a few years and send money is a positive fact not to be missed—Nepal’s remittance is growing every year, thanks to the students-turned-non-resident Nepalis and labour migrants. But what we gain from remittance, we end up losing in the form of human capital. At a median age of 27.1, we are still a relatively younger country, which makes us a lucrative source for the export of youths.Our youths are heading out of the country in hundreds of thousands each year, and the risk is that they might return to the country only when we have missed the train of development. It is no surprise that 33 percent of the NOCs are obtained for study in Japan, a country of old people with a median age of almost 50 years. Ageing or aged developed countries like Japan, the United States and Canada, among many others, need a constant supply of youth migrants willing to toil hard. Poor countries of Asia and Africa have become rich sources for the export of cheap labour that not only sustains the economies of developed countries but also supplies children who transform from immigrants to naturalised citizens and keep those countries in rude demographic health.Meanwhile, those in positions of power in Nepal, including political leaders, bureaucrats and university and school authorities, continue to turn the country into an undesirable place. As education becomes expensive and the job market is saturated, youths see no reason to stay back in Nepal. While education abroad is no guarantee of success, we have collectively failed to assure students of the quality of education we are offering at home. Apart from improving the quality itself, we also need to work on image-building—that Nepal’s education is not as bad as it has been made out to be.    \nThe Nepali cricket team’s second-ever T20 World Cup should have been a moment of joy but has turned into a dark crisis. But first, some introductions.Ever since I can remember, playing and watching cricket have been important parts of my identity. I have followed with joy the rise of Nepali cricket over the last 20 years. I am what you might call a fanatic. I never miss any Nepal match if I can help it, be it a friendly with a local club in India, a crunch qualifier against one of our nemesis associate nations, or a World Cup match against a Test nation. It does not matter what time zone a match is being played or where I am. I have also followed Sandeep Lamichhane’s career closely. He put Nepali cricket on the international map, and whether he played for the national team or some local T20 franchise, I tried to find a working link to be able to watch him play.I am establishing these credentials first because I expect fellow passionate Nepali cricket fans will rush to dismiss what comes next. But I want you to know that I love Nepali cricket just as much as you do, and so this is not part of some conspiracy to discredit Sandeep or Nepali cricket. Quite the opposite: I care about Nepali cricket too much to stay silent. At a time when populist stunts are rife, it feels necessary to speak truth to power, as an expression of love. Custodians of rape cultureMuch has been written about Sandeep’s Gaushala-26 rape case. As a rule of thumb, I choose to believe victims. The harassment she has faced—which culminated in her suicide attempt—beggars belief. She has remained steadfast against all pressure, rejecting advances to “settle” the case. It is hard to imagine why else anyone would willingly subject themselves to such inhumane treatment. This reflection, though, is not just about whether Sandeep raped Gaushala-26. My focus here is to examine Sandeep’s case as a textbook example of how our institutions perpetuate rape culture, where sexual abuse and violence are normalised. Custodian 1: The fansEver since Sandeep has been accused, the vast majority of his fans have taken to social media to defend him, as well as to defame the victim. Perhaps it is no surprise in a deeply patriarchal society in the grips of populism, where hero worship has taken new heights. Sandeep is a hero to many, and apparently he can do no wrong. Or, even if he wrongs, he is still above the law because he can bowl a mean googly, and that’s what matters. These fans- mostly but not exclusively young men- are vocal in their support for Sandeep. Even when he was a convicted felon, never mind when he was just accused of being a rapist- that too potentially of a minor- cricket mattered more to his devotees. Such craze toward their favourite cricketer substantially sustained a rape culture where allegations of sexual abuse were relegated to oblivion. When an overwhelming, assertive, visible, and vitriolic population aggressively downplays rape charges, it extinguishes any hope victims might have in their elusive quest for justice. Custodian 2: The courtsEvery level of the court system has already weighed in on Sandeep’s case. The Supreme Court—in its infinite wisdom—allowed him to represent the national team and travel abroad while on trial for rape charges. Along with the Prime Minister, who found it fitting to felicitate Sandeep in the middle of his trial, the Supreme Court’s tacit endorsement of Sandeep has made a mockery of victims’ rights and cemented rape culture as the established norm in Nepal. The Kathmandu District Court was at least bold enough to convict Sandeep of rape, though it did not find the victim to be a minor, which would have led to more significant consequences for Sandeep. Knowledge sources had commented then that this was already paving the way for a successful appeal later, which soon came to pass. The High Court overturned that conviction, acquitting Sandeep of all charges. Almost instantaneously, the fans came out in droves and celebrated that decision. Social media is swarmed with comments about how if Sandeep was punished when convicted, he should be reinstated immediately now that he is acquitted. It is an open secret that the judiciary- like many other institutions in Nepal- is compromised. Power and privilege run deep, and decisions are not just made on the merits of the legal argument. To all the fans now celebrating Sandeep’s acquittal and making that the basis for his rehabilitation, I have just one question: If you are from a poor family and if your loved one is sexually assaulted by someone rich, powerful, or politically connected, do you genuinely expect our judicial system to impart justice and punish the perpetrator? Take a moment, put yourself in the shoes of Gaushala-26’s family, and reflect on this question. If you honestly believe that justice would be served, I have a bridge to sell you.Custodian 3: CAN and the cricketing fraternityThe Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has towed a fine line, appearing to uphold the law in the strictest sense. As soon as Sandeep was convicted, CAN suspended him from all cricketing activities. He was only reinstated after he was acquitted by the High Court. Dig a bit deeper though, and rape culture rears its ugly head. Even while facing serious rape charges, CAN was not compelled by any sense of morality to prevent him from representing Nepal. Within moments of the High Court’s acquittal, CAN officials rushed to announce that Sandeep had been reinstated. They went above and beyond to lobby the US Embassy to grant him a visa on time. When that failed, they facilitated his travel to St. Vincent and the Grenadines for him to play the remaining matches. They have lobbied the International Cricket Council to ensure his inclusion while sacrificing another player from the squad. To be sure, CAN has faced incredible scrutiny and received intense pressure from “the fans” to back Sandeep. Yet, the rush to not only rehabilitate but actually elevate Sandeep demonstrates that CAN only saw the case as a nuisance. Even if the legal burden of proof might not have been met, CAN could and should have investigated whether Sandeep met the national team’s code of conduct, as has been customary in similar cases around the world. It should have taken time to study the decision, and it could have waited for the legal process to reach its logical conclusion; it is all but certain that a Supreme Court appeal will follow. What CAN has not done speaks volumes of how rape culture is sustained in Nepal. To my knowledge, no official has spoken publicly about whether Sandeep’s actions violated the expectations placed on national players, or expressed concern or solidarity for the victim. The reasons for Sandeep’s absence have been conveniently ignored, as if he has simply been on holiday or nursing a minor injury. Just as his absence was unexplained, so too has his return been left ‘unsaid’. The gaslighting of the entire saga shows the contempt with which the issue is treated in Nepal. The wider cricketing fraternity—which includes players, former players, coaches, commentators, sponsors, and officials—has, at best, adopted a veil of silence or, at worst, come out publicly in Sandeep’s support. Respected national and international commentators have found it convenient to use phrases such as “Sandeep is not available” when away and “Sandeep, the talisman of Nepali cricket, is back” now, without any mention of the dark context. A moment to engage with and educate a whole nation on how to take rape charges, and its victim, seriously has been left unaddressed. Because, of course, cricket comes first. A naïve hopeI expect the backlash to this piece to be swift and severe. It feels poignant that I am travelling to watch Nepal play in the World Cup in the very matches Sandeep will now play. But his celebrated return has filled me with dread, anxiety, and disgust, to the point that I do not know how to support my beloved team anymore. Spare a thought for Gaushala-26 and for all victims of rape and rape culture. Regardless of the legalese, we must strive to build a culture where victims are empowered and supported to speak up and stand for the truth. Nepali cricket has always found a way through adversity, often miraculously. Our obsession with star power must be replaced with a focus on the role cricket, and citizens, should play in sustaining a culture of accountability and respect for victims. As amazing as it is, cricket is still only a game and must become a vehicle for good, not evil.  \nAmidst ongoing violence, the international community pursues criminal prosecution in Ukraine, Sudan, Israel, and Gaza to address victims' rights to justice, but it faces challenges in balancing individual accountability with victims' needs for redress and truth.\nGovernment agencies and contractors engage in last-minute capital spending in Nepal's \"Asarey Vikas\" model, leading to substandard work and hindering development progress due to bureaucratic inefficiencies and lack of financial planning.\nGermany crushed Scotland 5-1 in Euro 2024 with a dominant first half performance, including three goals, and extended their lead after Scotland's Porteous was sent off, securing the biggest opening game margin of victory in the tournament's history.\nBiden may announce a program allowing immigrants illegally residing in the US to become legalized if married to US citizens, potentially energizing liberal voters in the upcoming election.\nThe weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country today.Koshi, Bagmati, Madhesh and hilly areas of Gandaki provinces will experience partly to generally cloudy weather while the rest of the country will be partly cloudy to mainly fair, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.Light to moderate rain with thunder is likely to occur at a few places of Koshi Province and Bagmati provinces.

Established in 1960, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing grants and zero- to low-interest loans for programmes that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people’s living conditions.Replenishing IDA’s resources will be a key topic of the meeting, which comes at the midpoint of a funding cycle concluding in December 2024—when donors commit to contributions for July 2025 to June 2028.The June 18 session kicks off four days of closed-door meetings to discuss IDA21’s proposed focus areas, assess the financing needs of countries supported by IDA, and consider financing scenarios.The overarching theme for IDA21 is ‘ending poverty on a livable planet: delivering impact with urgency and ambition’.To fulfil this, the IDA21 policy package will have five focus areas: people, planet, prosperity, infrastructure and digitalisation, supported by four lenses of gender, jobs, fragility, conflict and violence, and private investments. The current replenishment (IDA20) ends on June 30, 2025.The target, or a narrow range of scenarios, for the pledging session, is typically agreed upon at the fourth replenishment meeting in October. IDA21 resources will be available for commitments for a three-year period starting July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2028.IDA will continue to provide special support for countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence and utilise windows to provide additional resources specific to key thematic priorities, such as crisis response, addressing regional challenges, and providing blended finance for private sector investments in IDA countries, among others.“IDA is scaling up its market share significantly, also enabling co-financing and coordinating donor resources to maximise impact. IDA is a transparent, accountable, and cost-effective platform that delivers results, making it a prime investment for global development finance. So you can get a sense of how important this meeting is,” said Hadad-Zervos.He said that Nepal's development story is original. “It is one of economic transformation in the face of various challenges. It faced almost every challenge that a country could face—conflict, earthquakes, Covid, climate crisis, floods, and many others.”“This confluence has put Nepal's development gains at risk. Yet Nepal is a very resilient country. And despite these challenges, it has achieved significant development progress,” he said.Shree Krishna Nepal, joint-secretary at the finance ministry, said that the World Bank Group’s first economic mission to Nepal was in 1963 to assess the country's developing prospects and challenges. The group approved its first credit in 1969 for a telecommunications project that continues to be transformative today.Since then, IDA has provided Nepal with $6 billion in credits and grants. Currently, the World Bank is supporting 24 projects worth $2.3 billion. The World Bank said IDA is also helping transform the lives of millions of Nepalis through investments in education, health, jobs and skills, connectivity and infrastructure, social protection, food security, and others.A robust IDA 21 replenishment will ensure that IDA countries continue to benefit from it and that IDA continues its decades-long track record of lifting millions of people out of poverty, providing quality education for children, ensuring access to health services, and creating jobs so that people in low-income countries can become self-sustainable and living, according to the multilateral funding agency. \nNarendra Modi begins his third term as Prime Minister of India, with South Asian leaders attending the swearing-in ceremony, amid ongoing bilateral issues with Nepal on boundary disputes and the Agnipath recruitment scheme.\nNepal's Supreme Court overturned a land swap decision, prompting opposition criticism of the Oli government's \"policy corruption,\" highlighting concerns about opaque lawmaking in the country.\nThe collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress. In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  \nAfter a three-year delay, Nepal's telecom regulator is preparing to auction 5G frequency despite telecom service providers stating the market is not ready due to low data usage, high infrastructure investment costs, and ongoing disputes with the government.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled.

The ministry has sought information on the teachers and professors affiliated to the parties from the Election Commission and the respective district education units.The initiative was taken as per the Political Parties Act, 2017 which prohibits the teachers, professors and other government employees from engaging in politics. Similarly, the Patan High Court on October 5, 2021 had ruled that school teachers cannot engage in active politics. Responding to a writ petition, the court said those drawing salaries and benefits from the state coffers should not be involved in partisan politics. The major parties have disapproved of Shrestha’s move as a large number of teachers are their cadres. For instance, as many as 263 of the 4,743 representatives to the Nepali Congress general convention held in December 2021 were school teachers and staff. The number is above five percent of the total delegates.The main opposition CPN-UML also had dozens of teachers as representatives in its 10th general congress held in November that year. Hundreds of school teachers are associated with the CPN (Maoist Centre) as well.Leaders from all these parties have criticised the move directly or indirectly. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel said the principals of many best-performing community schools were affiliated to different parties.“It is unnecessary to test teachers’ DNA. Let them work,” he said, implying that there was no need to probe whether the teachers are affiliated to a political party.Another factor antagonising the major parties is Shrestha’s decision to make public the report of the High-Level National Education Commission— more than five years after it was submitted to then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli.On June 7, she made public the report that Oli and his successors had for years kept under wraps. The government was under the pressure of private schools to keep the report a secret as it envisions converting the schools registered as companies into trusts within 10 years. Converting the existing schools into trusts would mean they will be barred from taking profits home. Several cross-party leaders have investments in private schools.Oli was so annoyed by Minister Shrestha’s decision to make the report public that he resorted to making personal remarks about her nationality and marital status without naming her.Now the teachers’ unions of various parties have united against her. The ministry on May 27 endorsed a directive guiding teachers’ transfers. The directive came amid allegations that teachers are being transferred without fulfilling the due procedure. The directive is accused of encroaching on the authority of the School Management Committee and increasing the ministry’s role in transfers. “Your good education is meaningless if you are doing more harm than good to the education sector,” said Shankar Adhikari, chair of the teacher association close to the Maoist Centre, referring to Shrestha’s foreign degree. “She has a shallow understanding of Nepal's education sector.”Leaders of other teacher associations have asked the minister to reverse the directive, warning of the consequences of not doing so. “The directive was issued with the mala fide intent of troubling teachers. This is unacceptable,” said Gyanedra Rawal of the Nepal Teachers’ Union, the Congress teachers’ wing.Some lawmakers and education experts, however, have supported minister Shrestha, saying she is on the right track to improve the country's education sector. Addressing the lower house meeting on Wednesday, independent lawmaker Amresh Kumar Singh said he fully supports the education minister, who is making the necessary intervention. “The education minister is taking the right course. Her works need to be appreciated,” he said.Those who have followed Shrestha’s work also praise her. “She [Shrestha] is eager to bring about vital changes, mainly in school education,” said Usha Jha, a former member of the National Planning Commission.However, many officials at the ministry are unhappy with her work. While she is dedicated to her job, she has a habit of not listening to others, they allege. “The minister thinks she knows everything and is not accommodative. This is the reason her decisions are dragged into controversy,” said a senior official at the ministry. “A minister is a team leader who has to take all the staff along. But that is not the case now.” \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, is set for its Unity General Convention, which will commence on Monday in Janakpur, a month after the party suffered a split.The federal chair of the JSP-Nepal, Ashok Rai, along with seven federal lawmakers and 30 central committee members, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party.The party split was more visible at the centre, but it is said to have had a lesser impact on Yadav’s faction in the province so far.Party insiders say the dissidents in provincial assemblies and party committees couldn’t get organised to form new committees as the registration of the new party at the election commission was immediately challenged in the Supreme Court. The court asked the commission and other authorities to put the process on hold, and the case is still sub judice. When the court gives a verdict on the issue, the JSP-Nepal's fence-sitters may decide whether to remain with the party or defect to the new outfit.Just a week before the unity general convention, the party suffered another setback as it had to give up the chief minister’s post in Madhesh Province when the erstwhile coalition partners–the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—withdrew their support to the government. During the floor test held on June 5 JSP-Nepal lawmaker Saroj Kumar Yadav, the immediate past chief minister of the province, fell 4 votes short from securing the position. When he garnered 50 votes in support, 53 members voted against him. In the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister has to secure at least 54 votes in support.Upendra Yadav's parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, continuously led the provincial government for almost seven years until Satish Kumar Singh of the Janamat Party dethroned Yadav’s party from the chief ministerial position on June 7.Though the recent party split and the dethroning of the Madhesh Province’s leadership can be blamed on the party leadership, according to analysts, the unity general convention poses little challenge to Yadav. Because of the split, there are no leaders left in the party who’d challenge Yadav, Chandra Kishore, an observer of Madhesh politics, told the Post. “Therefore, the general convention should be a walk in the park for him.” The party that held its statute convention last year adopted a policy of lobbying for a directly elected presidential system in the country. Likewise, the Madhesh-based party set the goal of fighting for a parliament with fully proportional representation. This is expected to direct policy at the unity convention. However, experts question the sustainability of the policies adopted by the statute convention in the party's post-split situation.“The policies adopted by the statute convention will remain intact,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “The party division, which is sub judice in the Supreme Court, will not impact policy changes.”Chandra Kishore, who has been following Madhesh politics for a long time, differs from Adhikari.“Yadav is a political strategist. He acts as per the situation,” he said. “He will not necessarily act as per the party documents.” The JSP-Nepal’s central committee in January, two months before the split, decided to hold the unity general convention in June. The party decided to organise the convention in order to consolidate the unity between various Madhes-based parties over time, party leaders said.This is the first unity convention held after the merger of various Madhes-based parties, Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson for the JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, led by Mahantha Thakur; the Rastriya Madhesh Samajbadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari; the Tarai Madhesh Sadbhawana Party, led by Mahendra Yadav’ the Sadbhawana Party, led by Rajendra Mahato; the Madheshi Janadhikar Ganatantrik Party, led by Raj Kishor Yadav; and Anil Jha’s Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged to form the Rastriya Janata Party before the 2017 general and provincial elections.The Rastriya Janata Party and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party led by Upendra Yadav fought the 2017 elections with a tie-up in Madhesh but merged the parties in 2020 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. When the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli issued an ordinance to split the Yadav-led party to counterbalance a rift within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed after the merger of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) following the 2017 election, the merger in the two Madhesh-based parties was hastened. Before this, the only Madheshi party to hold the general convention periodically was the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Gajendra Narayan Singh, who formed the Nepal Sadbhabana Council in 1985, turned the council into a party following the first people’s movement of 1990.Yadav’s will be another Madhesh-based party to hold the general convention more than once, Suman said.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates a political party to hold its general convention at least once in five years. However, if the office bearers cannot be elected in five years due to a situation arising out of special circumstances, based on the statute of a political party, new leaders can be elected within six months thereafter. The constitutional time frame is not mandatory for a new party or one formed after a split. As Nepal’s regional parties often suffer splits, they rarely hold the general convention periodically.The Upendra Yadav-led Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) held its second convention in 2009, in Birgunj, just after the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The MJF was a rights-based organisation before it entered politics after the first Madhesh uprising of 2007. JSP-Nepal spokesperson Suman said Yadav has led various political parties, but this is the second time an outfit he leads is holding the general convention.The Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar-led Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (Loktantrik) held its first general convention in Biratnagar in May 2016. The same year, Nepal Sadbhawana Party also held its general conventions in April.The JSP-Nepal has invited foreign dignitaries to the unity convention. The party's foreign affairs department chief, Arjun Thapa, said delegates from India, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Spain, and Indonesia have already arrived in Nepal.Invitations have been extended to various parties, except the Janata Samajbadi Party led by Ashok Rai, which splintered from the JSP-Nepal. The Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoist Centre, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) are other parties that will participate in the Janakpur convention. Party leaders say the opening ceremony will be held on Monday, whereas the closed session, which will discuss the party’s political documents, is scheduled for the subsequent days. \nNepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa has joined the group of leaders calling for a constitutional amendment in order to address the underperforming provincial system and the political instability allegedly caused by the mixed electoral system the country constitutionally endorsed nearly a decade ago. After a change in coalition at the centre began to affect provincial governments, voices for reforming the electoral system through constitutional amendment are growing louder. Speaking at a programme in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, a general secretary of the largest party in the House of Representatives, argued that reforming the electoral system had become necessary to ensure political stability. He also said that the provinces’ performance so far shows that the federal system cannot be sustained in its current form. “By reform in the provincial structure, I do not mean scrapping the federal system altogether, which the country cannot afford,” Thapa told the Post when asked to explain his statement. “The issue of governments’ formation in the provinces has been challenged in court. This is a result of lack of clarity on provincial government formation in the constitution.”The government formation process in Koshi and Gandaki provinces have been challenged multiple times, and the Supreme Court has many times invalidated the chief ministerial appointment and election processes in the two provinces.Questions have been raised over the expenditures for running the provincial governments. “To address this issue, we need to downsize the elected representatives’ bodies not only in the provinces but also at the federal level. For that, we need constitutional reform,” Thapa added. “We bear a collective responsibility to protect and sustain the constitution. This, however, requires some amendments. Reform in the electoral system is as important,” Thapa emphasised. The provinces followed the same process of government formation practised at the centre and that caused problems, he said. Thapa stressed that amendments to the constitution could address all these issues.The Congress leader says it is wrong to advocate either for scrapping the federal system altogether or and fully retaining the constitutional provisions on the provinces. The Rastriya Prajantara Party, which bats for the revival of the Hindu Kingdom, has been demanding the scrapping of the country’s federal structure. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which was formed two years ago, also wants the provincial structure overhauled. The new party says it wants to downsize the middle layer of the federal system. The party hasn’t participated in the provincial elections.Former National Assembly member Khim Lal Devkota, who is also an expert on federalism and a columnist at The Post, sees a slim chance of any changes in the federal system even though “it is necessary”.“I have closely worked with Nepal’s top political leaders. I believe they won’t readily amend the constitution,” Devkota told the Post. “The longer we take to amend the constitution, the more questions there will be on the longevity of the constitution.” During the Congress Mahasamiti meeting held in February, many leaders raised their voices in favour of filling all seats of the lower house of the federal parliament through direct election. Instead of electing a section of the lower house under the Proportional Representation (PR) system, the leaders had suggested that the upper house of the parliament be filled exclusively through the PR system. They were of the view that Nepal would not have a stable government unless all the lower house members were directly elected by their constituencies.Devkota is also of the opinion that Nepal needs to reform the election system. The mixed electoral system should be changed to create an environment for political instability, he said.In the 275-strong federal lower house, 165 are directly elected, whereas 110 come from the PR category. The upper chamber has 59 members. Of them, 56 are chosen through an electoral college comprising provincial assembly members and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units. Each province elects eight members, while three are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers.Likewise, among the 550 members in the seven provincial assemblies, 220 are elected under the PR category. This number is large compared to the population size and thus needs to be reduced significantly, say experts.However, Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, blames the political leaders for the current problems of the provinces. Top politicians are using provincial governments and assemblies to place their second- and third-tier leaders. This has burdened the state without yielding any tangible results, he added. Pokharel says this represents a failure of the leadership rather than the federal system.Since the inception of the provincial system, political parties have appointed chief ministers on a rotational basis, Pokharel told the Post. “It is true that there are operational problems in the provinces, but leaders are more responsible for this than the system.” Even though the state structure is federal, political parties have yet to adopt the three-tier system within their organisations, he said. “What stops the political parties from giving autonomy to their provincial committees and letting them make decisions regarding the provinces on their own?” Pokharel questioned.Devkota, however, said two models should be considered to ensure the stability of provincial governments.The first involves distributing the government leadership positions based on the number of seats won in the election, and the second concerns implementing provisions similar to those at the local government level. According to the first model, the chief minister and other positions are distributed based on the number of seats shared in the provincial assembly elections, and the government is run among the constituent parties on a consensus basis.As per the second method, the chief minister is directly elected by voters, similar to the election of mayors or chairs at the local units. This makes the chief ministers fully accountable to the people. The chief minister can be removed by a two-thirds majority of the provincial assembly, thus preventing one from being an autocrat. One of the major concerns is the destabilising linkage of provincial politics with the power equation in Kathmandu. When the coalition at the centre changes, governments in the provinces also change.The subnational governments changed immediately after the change in coalition partners in Kathmandu on March 4. When Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal changed ruling partners, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives, CPN-UML, joined the government while the largest force, the Congress, was ousted from power. The changes at the centre immediately triggered changes in the provinces as well. \nFive years after submission, the government unveiled the long-awaited report of the High-Level National Education Commission, which includes recommendations for transforming private schools into trusts to curb commercialization and allocating a minimum of 20% of the budget to education.\nPolice arrested two individuals in Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency from CTEVT lab using 64 desktops and a server.\nCIB arrests 3 cooperative operators for embezzling Rs74 million after promising depositors attractive interest rates.\nKathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah's New Road sidewalk expansion plan, opposed by the UML-led federal government, gains support from the Nepali Congress, escalating a conflict involving land swap allegations and questions about federalism.\nTwo unidentified bodies, a woman and a man, were found at the bottom of a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, with a crashed motorcycle nearby suggesting an accident.\nWith the monsoon just around the corner, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has finally started repairing the Sisdole road that leads to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district. Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nHard Rock Cafe® Kathmandu's \"The Himalayan Burger\" has been ranked among the top five in Hard Rock International’s prestigious World Burger Tour.

The scheme aims to promote sustainable growth in developing countries by using a more generous trade preferences scheme than with other trade partners.The scheme applies to 65 countries, which fall into three tiers of preferences. Each category has increasing levels of preferential market access for the countries, meaning that the LDCs get the most generous treatment. The scheme has received a largely positive response, despite some criticism that it did not differ enough from its GSP initiative.Officials at the ministry said that during the meeting, Bhandari requested the British government to increase the technical assistance targeted for industry and export, which will help the export growth of Nepal.The meeting also discussed intellectual property rights protection and promotion and bilateral trade and investment between the countries.The minister expressed commitment to expanding British government partnerships in sectors like interconnection, infrastructure development, energy, trade, tourism, investment, and public-level issues. He also called for Nepal’s readiness to benefit from the UK's experience, knowledge, skill, and technology for the development of industry, hydropower, and education.During the meeting, Ambassador Fenn said that the UK is willing to work with the private sector and stay close to the government on its development. He committed to supporting the promotion of Nepali exports. Citing the UK's support for a free economy, he said the country will play a major role in connecting Nepal with the global market.Trade experts, however, argue that developed countries should continue the trade preference facilities during the transition period.Chandra Ghimire, former secretary at the industry ministry, said that developed countries like the UK need to continue duty-free quota-free market access for LDC graduates during the transition phase or for at least 8 to 10 years.“This will help the country’s exports do better and prevent the country from experiencing market shocks. For this, Nepal needs to actively negotiate with the market countries.”Nepal has two and a half years to graduate from the LDC, but the government's work to date is not sufficient, Ghimire said. “The country's national strategy to graduate from LDC is not as comprehensive as it should have been, it is implemented slowly, and it has always been challenging.”According to the Department of Customs, the total trade between Nepal and the UK increased by 16.21 percent in the last fiscal year, 2022-23, which ended in mid-July, from the previous fiscal year.Nepal’s exports to the UK increased by 6.73 percent to Rs3.33 billion in the review period, while imports increased by 21.57 percent to Rs5.33 billion. The country’s trade deficit with the UK remained at Rs2.20 billion.According to a report, ‘Nepal’s graduation from the LDC category, the implication for international trade and development cooperation,’ published by South Asia Watch of Trade, Economics and Environment in September 2022, Nepal’s merchandise exports could fall by 2.5 percent to 4 percent as a result of increased tariffs upon graduation. Exports to the European Union (EU) are expected to see the largest losses, assuming that Nepali exports will face ordinary GSP instead of GSP+. Getting GSP+ will significantly reduce export losses in the EU.The tariff increase analysis, coupled with the existing estimates of the impact on exports, underscores the importance of securing access to the GSP+ and GSP Enhanced Framework(EF) schemes in the EU and the UK, respectively. The EU’s newly proposed GSP for the period 2024-34 requires the ratification and effective implementation of 32 international agreements, adding five agreements to the current 27 international conventions. Nepal has to ratify and implement 27 conventions to be eligible for the UK’s Export Finance scheme, the same as with the EU's current GSP+ scheme.According to the report, LDC graduation will have not only tariff implications but also more stringent rules of origin provisions in preference-granting countries, including the EU, the UK, Canada, Australia, and the Russian Federation, among others.Many products, particularly apparel and made-up textile products, will face more stringent rules of origin in the form of double transformation requirements compared to the single transformation required for the LDCs, the report said.Readymade garment exporters express concerns that they may not be able to meet the more restrictive rules of origin requirements even if the alternative preference schemes offer preferential tariffs.Trade experts have been saying that Nepal may lose a huge European market as it might not get facilities under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative. This scheme grants full duty-free and quota-free access to the European Union Single Market for all products (except arms and ammunition).“We might need to go for a GSP+, but it is not easy to get as some criteria like ratifying convention of ILO, which the country has yet to do, and the rules of origin criteria are also not easy,” Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary told the Post in a recent interview.GSP is a special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance. GSP+ slashes these same tariffs to zero percent for vulnerable low- and lower-middle-income countries that implement 27 international conventions related to labour and human rights, environmental and climate protection, and good governance. \nIn February 1984, Maciej Berbeka and Maciej Pawlikowski of Poland became the first people to climb Cho Oyu, the sixth-highest mountain in the world, from the Nepal side.The mountain, which straddles the Nepal-China border, lies 20 km west of Everest. The 8,201-metre peak was first scaled in winter from the southeast pillar. The caravan route was Kathmandu-Lukla-Namce-Gokyo and Cho Oyu base camp.After three years, in May 1987, Ang Phuri Sherpa became the first Nepali to reach the peak from the Nepal side. It was in spring. Then a group of Russian climbers summited the peak in the autumn of 1991, followed by two Japanese in 1994.The last time Cho Oyu was conquered was in the spring of 2009, when Denis Urubko and Boris Dedeshko of Kazakhstan reached its top. After a decade and a half, a seven-member Sherpa team, including a French national, reached the summit last week. Cho Oyu is considered one of the most accessible 8,000ers from the Chinese side, while the Nepal side is considered among the toughest.Only 21 people have reached Cho Oyu from Nepal’s side in the past 70 years. By contrast, more than 4,000 have successfully climbed the mountain from the Tibetan side. This makes Cho Oyo the second most climbed eight-thousander after Everest.Among the 8,000ers, Cho Oyu has the lowest death rate.On June 7, the French Alasdair McKenzie, with Gelje, Tenging Gyaljen and other sherpas, stood atop Cho Oyu at 8:35 pm via the southwest ridge. The caravan route was Kathmandu-Lukla-Namche-Thame and Cho Oyu base camp.Unlike past expeditions, last week’s climb was meant to prepare a permanent route for a commercial expedition from the Nepal side.“With this success, Cho Oyu has become more accessible from Nepal, heralding a new era in Nepali mountaineering and inspiring future expeditions to tackle its challenging routes,” said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks, the agency which explored the local route. Nepal boasts of eight of the 14 highest peaks over 8,000m on the planet. They are Everest, Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, Cho Oyu and Annapurna. But to climb Cho Oyu, climbers usually had to go to Tibet first.“From now onwards, commercial expeditions will happen from the Nepal side. This is good news for all expedition agencies. Climbers will no longer need to go through a long process of getting permission from the Tibetan authority. All eight mountains above 8,000 are now accessible from the Nepal side,” said Mingma.Last Friday, the team started the summit push at 2:00 am from Camp IV, and after a relentless effort of over 18 hours, they made it to the top. “This remarkable achievement was the result of a meticulously planned expedition that started in March and commenced in the first week of May from Lukla,” said Mingma.According to Mingma, a commercial expedition on Cho Oyu may last 60 days and could cost a foreigner between $25,000 and $30,000.“That’s obviously a welcome development. It will create more jobs on the mountain,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. “But it’s too early to say whether the route will be a commercial success,” he said. For instance, the operating cost incurred from the Nepali side is nearly double that from the Tibetan side, in addition to the challenges a vertical wall poses.Transporting goods from Kathmandu to the Cho Oyu base camp would cost $5 per kg. However, as the road reaches the advanced base camp or camp above the base camp of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side, the cost on that route would be $2 per kg.“There is a lot of difference in the operating costs. Climbing from the Tibetan side would cost $13,000 a person,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa. “So, obviously, the climber's preference would be the Tibetan side. First due to the lower factor, and, second, it’s an easier climb from the north.”The success of the new route will depend on its commercial feasibility.Mingma said Cho Oyu’s Nepal side is known for its steep, vertical walls rising thousands of metres, making it one of the greatest present-day challenges. He, however, said once the route becomes commercial, competition will bring down the cost.“More than that, foreigners do not need to wait weeks or even months for the Tibetan authority’s permit to climb.”The story of the first expedition, from the Tibetan side, however, is more interesting.According to the archive of Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, Cho Oyu was first chosen for an expedition in 1952 in preparation for an Everest ascent the following year.The first attempt of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side was made by a British party led by Eric Shipton, with Edmund Hillary, George Lowe, Charles Evans, and Tom Bourdilon as its members. However, technical difficulties at an ice cliff above 6,650m forced them to give up the climb.According to the archive, the expedition, led by the British Eric Shipton, was estimated to take two weeks. “It would also mean entering the Tibetan territory, which it is believed Shipton was unwilling to do,” according to the archive.It was Shipton who first measured Cho Oyu as the sixth-highest mountain in the world.An Austrian expedition, led by Herbert Tichy, arrived in Birgunj in 1954 via India and flew into Kathmandu on an Indian airliner of the time. Once they were packed and ready, they moved to Bhaktapur, from where the long trek to the mountain would begin.There were only three foreign climbers and eleven sherpas on the team.Cho Oyu was finally climbed on October 19, 1954, via the northwest ridge in Tibet by Tichy, Joseph Jöchler and Pasang Dawa Lama.Before Cho Oyu, Everest and Annapurna in Nepal, and Nanga Parbat in Pakistan had been climbed. \nAt least one case of cholera, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, has been confirmed in Kathmandu.According to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, a 62-year-old man from Makwanpur district, who had been admitted with severe diarrhoea some two weeks ago, tested positive for the deadly disease.The man is said to have been residing in Kathmandu for a long time.“The health condition of the patient was serious when he was brought to our hospital,” said a health worker serving at the Hospital’s Emergency Department, asking not to be named, as the official was not authorised to speak to the media. “The stool test confirmed a cholera infection.”According to health workers at the hospital, Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in stool samples of infected patients.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.The Kathmandu Valley witnessed a massive cholera outbreak in the monsoon of 2022 in which 77 cholera-positive cases were confirmed. Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months.Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home. Only serious cases end up in hospitals.”Meanwhile, officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that they are unaware of any confirmed cholera cases in the district. “We don’t have information about a cholera outbreak in recent days,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office in Kathmandu. “We are the agency responsible for investigating the causes of outbreaks of deadly diseases, and as of today (Friday) we don’t have such information.”Sapkota informed that one case of cholera infection was reported from Sitapaila in Kathmandu about three months ago. An Indian national who is a truck driver was admitted to the Sukraraj Hospital at that time.“We had mobilised our team to investigate the source of the outbreak,” said Sapkota. Doctors warn that concealing outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and failing to investigate their sources and inform the public about the risks can prove counterproductive, as the deadly bacteria keep spreading in communities if preventative measures are not taken.Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected with them every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main catalysts for the spread of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City that were highly affected by the outbreak. In October 2021, a Vibrio cholera outbreak in several local units of Kapilvastu district killed at least four people including three minors—boys aged seven and two, and a five-year-old girl. Another deceased was a 45-year-old man.Following the outbreak, the Health Ministry had launched a mass vaccination drive against the disease after all its attempts failed to curb the infection.The World Health Organisation says that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors say launching awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from dying of water-borne diseases, including cholera.A combination of careful survey, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nPost-monsoon is considered the dengue epidemic season. However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.“Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.”Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said.Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death. \nPolio vaccination in the Tarai region is being affected by severe heat, with at least 1.46 million children at risk of infection as the campaign is paused due to school closures.\nThe 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births. Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nNepal restricted South Africa to a lowly total of 115 runs in Group D match of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup being held at the Arnos Vale Ground, West Indies.Sent to bat first, the Group D leaders struggled to put points together as Nepal’s Kushal Bhurtel and Dipendra Singh Airee shone with the ball.Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 tuns off 11 balls before being dismissed by Airee in 3.4 overs.Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs, and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after.Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks stood his ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavillion by Airee in 15.3 overs.Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play.Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-0ver spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs.South Africa have already reached the Super Eight stage after heavy rain in Florida led to the abandonment of the Nepal-Sri Lanka match on June 11.Nepal lost to the Netherlands in their opening game and sit in the fourth position with one point. But they still have a chance to progress to the Super Eight if they win both of their remaining matches—against South Africa and Bangladesh. \nNepal can finally breathe a sigh of relief and will have at least something to cheer for when they return home from Saudi Arabia—thanks to a spirited battle against a strong Yemen.The Gorkhalis headed into their last Group H game of the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers against Yemen on Tuesday low in confidence after losing all of their previous five matches, with their most recent embarrassment coming in a 4-0 drubbing by group winners United Arab Emirates last week.Vincenzo Alberto Annese’s men had conceded 18 goals in five qualifiers matches, scoring none in reply.Nepal’s dismal qualifiers campaign was also partly contributed by the sheer negligence of sports authorities All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) and National Sports Council whose poor management of the country’s only international standard football venue—Dasharath Stadium—forced Nepal to play their two home matches at neutral venues.However, on Tuesday, they floored Yemen with a dogged fightback until the death after initially falling behind to a ninth minute Nasser Al Gahwashi penalty at the Prince Mohammad bin Fahd Stadium in Dammam, thanks to Sanjeeb Bista and Gillespye Jung Karki whose goals either side of the half time turned things around for Nepal.Although Mohammed Al Dahi’s equaliser in the first minute of stoppage time denied them a first victory of the qualifiers and also a first win against Yemen, their dogged display will still serve as a testament that the youth Nepali squad have a lot of potential.The draw against Yemen will especially wash the burden off the Italian coach Annese whose contract with Nepal is expiring this month.Annese, who was appointed as Nepal head coach in March last year, has been under a sharp knife following a series of disappointing results that also included a draw against minnows Bhutan, disappointing SAFF Championship campaign and World Cup Qualifiers first round struggles against Laos.The 39-year-old coach has been using the exodus of Nepali football stars including Bimal Gharti Magar and Sujal Shrestha to Australia and an inexperienced squad as his defence for Nepal’s poor run of results in the international arena.But he seems to have finally cracked the code in his probably last game with Nepal as coach. And the output against Yemen could possibly convince ANFA to trigger another extension in his contract. ANFA had added a three-month extension in Annese’s contract this year.The emergence of Sanjeeb, who only made his international debut in March this year as an 88th minute substitute during a 5-0 qualifiers loss to Bahrain, is even more promising.Sanjeeb, who played full 90 minutes in Nepal’s 3-0 loss against Bahrain before being benched in 4-0 defeat to the UAE, had a hand in both of Nepal’s goals against Yemen in Dammam.Sanjeeb, who replaced star forward Anjan Bista in the front, first pounced on a misplaced back pass from Radhawan Al Hubaishi and bent the ball past Yemen goalkeeper Mohammed Khairalah to score an equaliser in the 22nd minute.Sanjeeb then received a long pass from Chhiring Lama and served it for Karki to head home Nepal’s second goal in the 66th.It was the first international goals for both Sanjeeb and Karki. Karki made his debut for Nepal in September last year during Nepal’s goalless draw with Myanmar. The evening was also memorable for Nepal captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Playing his 100th international match, the 34-year-old goalkeeper produced a string of stunning saves to keep Yemen at bay till the final moments and helped Nepal earn a point.Even though Nepal failed to reach the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and could not directly qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup, they still have a chance to secure their spot in their maiden Asian Cup through Asian Cup Qualification which will be played between March 25, 2025 to March 31, 2026.Top two teams from each nine groups qualified for the third round of 2026 FIFA World Cup and also secured a direct berth to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, China, Oman, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Indonesia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Australia and Palestine progressed.The 18 nations who failed to advance (India, Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Chinese Taipei, Turkmenistan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Philippines, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Nepal, Lebanon and Bangladesh) will compete in the 24-team AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers, with only six teams making it to the Asian Cup finals.Bhutan, the Maldives and Laos will join them in the third round of Asian Cup Qualification as the best ranking losing teams of the first round. The winners of the Asian Cup Qualifiers playoffs between Sri Lanka and Cambodia, Timor-Leste and Mongolia and Brunei Darussalam and Macau will also be in the competition. \nNepal and Sri Lanka shared a point each after heavy rain in Florida and waterlogged outfield at the Central Broward Stadium in Lauderhill led to the abandonment of their T20 World Cup Group D match on Tuesday.The outcome means Group D leaders South Africa became the first team in the 20-team tournament to progress to the Super Eight stage. The Proteas are unbeaten and have won all three matches they have played. They have six points from three games.The result also leaves former champions Sri Lanka without a win after three games and puts the Lankans on the brink of elimination from group stage. Sri Lanka lost their opening games to South Africa and Bangladesh. They face the Netherlands in Gros Islet in their final group game on Monday but may find themselves already out of the tournament by then.Nepal lost to the Dutch in their opening game and sit in the fourth position with one point. But they still have a chance to progress to the Super Eight if they win both of their remaining matches. They play against South Africa on Saturday and Bangladesh on Monday.Bangladesh and the Netherlands are tied on two points but the Tigers occupy the second spot due to net run rate. Both of them have two matches in hand. \nSouth Korea and US officials discuss emergency response to a possible North Korea visit by Russian President Putin, with concerns over military cooperation and regional stability being raised.\nG7 leaders agreed to provide $50 billion to Ukraine from frozen Russian assets, strengthened security with Ukraine, expressed concerns over China, Gaza, and the Middle East, and discussed artificial intelligence, economic development, and potential leadership changes.\nChina experiences drought in multiple provinces due to a prolonged lack of rainfall and extreme heat, prompting government responses to mitigate impacts on agriculture, water, and energy supplies, while southern China faces heavy rainfall warnings.\nG7 leaders gather to bolster Ukraine support, confront China's ambitions, and address global challenges amidst domestic turmoil.\nForeign book publishers do not authorize Nepali publishers to translate their books, leading to the widespread availability of unauthorized translations of popular works in Nepal, harming authors, publishers, and readers.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe Constitution of Nepal defines health as a fundamental right, stating that every citizen is entitled to free basic health services. However, due to high costs, over half a million Nepalis are deprived of primary healthcare. The country has 7,221 public health facilities, including 125 hospitals, 205 primary health care centres, 395 ayurvedic hospitals, 3,870 health posts and 2,626 community health centres and private health institutions. Despite this wide healthcare structure, the system still struggles to provide accessible and affordable healthcare services to the entire population. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that poverty increases by 2 percent every year due to high out-of-pocket expenditure (OOP) on health services from the private sector. In Nepal, the OOP constitutes 57.7 percent of the current health expenditure, while the government’s share is only 22.6 percent. Nepal has introduced schemes such as the Social Security Fund, the Employee Provident Fund, and the National Health Insurance Programme (NHIP), as well as enterprise private insurance, free healthcare, conditional cash transfer programmes, and improvised citizen programmes to reduce OOP and improve accessibility. However, the effectiveness of these schemes still remains in question. An appropriate pre-financing mechanism is needed to reduce the uncertainty of health illness and the catastrophic cost associated with healthcare. Nepal Government introduced the National Insurance Programme in 2016 to comply with the constitution and work towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030, a vital aspect of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UHC ensures access to quality healthcare without financial hardships. The target of SDG8 has two indicators: Coverage of essential healthcare services and financial protection for all. Low insurance coverageThe NHIP was designed to offer quality care at a minimal cost, guided by legal and policy frameworks to achieve the UHC. It was initially piloted in three districts—Kailali, Baglung and Illam. Despite a favourable policy environment, coverage and retention are not up to the mark, with only 23 percent enrollment and a significant dropout of 25 percent, which is a serious concern. Coverage is uneven, with Koshi province achieving 42 percent coverage while Madhesh lags at 8 percent. The programme also inadequately covers only 26 out of 77 districts of ultra-poor citizens. Although the NHIP aims to cover the nationwide population by 2030, numerous challenges lie ahead.The NHIP faces several barriers, including epidemiological and geographical limitations, limited risk pooling, stagnant financing, lack of financial sustainability assessment, difficulty in seeking referral services, inadequate local-level empanelment of health facilities, limited digitalisation of the NHIP functions and insufficient government ownership. To improve the NHIP and move towards universal healthcare, Nepal can learn about successful health insurance programmes of other countries. Lessons from elsewhereEvery country has a different insurance system to achieve universal healthcare goals. Japan uses a single-payer system where the government is the sole payer for healthcare services. By centralising the payment through the government, Japan has control over healthcare costs and maintains high standards of care. It is designed to provide universal health coverage and ensure accessibility of healthcare services to all people. Singapore uses a hybrid system where individual responsibility is balanced with government support. This approach aims to provide comprehensive coverage while maintaining sustainability and encouraging accountability in healthcare expenditures. Rwanda’s community-based health insurance programme mandates participation, particularly targeting rural and poor populations. The premium rates are progressive, i.e., based on income levels, ensuring the poorer individual pays less. Thailand has significantly improved health insurance coverage through contributions from civil servants and voluntary participation from those in the informal sector. Civil servants contribute to the system as part of their employment benefits, and for those in the informal sector, voluntary schemes are available, encouraging broader participation. This mixed approach helps to expand coverage and promotes universal health coverage. The United Kingdom has a publicly funded health system that provides medical services to the entire population regardless of socioeconomic status. Nepal can learn from the benefits of a tax-funded system, which offers preventive, promotive and curative health coverage. RecommendationsThe provision of health insurance is in its early stages in Nepal, so revising the benefits package to make it more comprehensive and focusing on enrolling underserved populations in Karnali, Sudurpaschim and Madhesh is essential. Instituting mobile clinics, community-based initiatives and strategic infrastructure development can help overcome geographical barriers and provide equitable healthcare services. Developing a sustainability roadmap, exploring innovative financing mechanisms and increasing healthcare spending should be emphasised to meet international benchmarks. Digitalising NHIP activities can improve efficiency, transparency and service delivery. National surveys to determine the coverage gap are vital in assessing the drop-out rate and increasing sustainability. Strengthening the NHIP is crucial for Nepal’s goal of achieving universal health care. Addressing the identified challenges and implementing proposed recommendations can enhance the NHIP’s effectiveness, ensuring equitable access to quality healthcare. Addressing disparities in health outcomes and financing mechanisms is also crucial to improving overall population health and ensuring everyone has access to quality healthcare. Improving worker training and supervision and prioritising service provider education, quality assurance, and preventive care could strengthen NHIP care. Enhancing rural healthcare accessibility is also necessary for health insurance. The government has increased the budget for the insurance programme, but its share of total health sector spending remains low compared to international benchmarks. The World Health Organization predicts that allocating 5 to 6 percent of GDP or 10 percent of the national budget towards healthcare will effectively cap out-of-pocket expenses. Despite this, Nepal consistently allocates below 5 percent of its national budget to healthcare. Increased funding in the healthcare system should be highly prioritised for the successful implementation of the NHIP.Sustainability issues can be addressed through social health insurance contributions and public-private partnerships. Continuous training and skill development for healthcare personnel can improve the quality of care. Performance-based payments can incentivise healthcare facilities to improve quality and efficiency. Using a mix of different funding methods instead of relying on just one is essential for providing universal healthcare and affordable healthcare services. A national health financing system should ensure every citizen can access healthcare when needed and protect families from financial catastrophe by covering out-of-pocket expenditures. Comprehensive governance and regulatory reform strategies are required to improve the scope, accessibility, quality, and sustainability of national health insurance coverage.  \nThey are everywhere. Sweeping floors in the homes of the wealthy, serving tea at stands, begging outside shopping malls, cleaning car windshields, working in brick kilns, and tilling the soil.Pakistan has several pieces of legislation that deal with child labour and yet millions of children are exploited and put to work in full view of the rest of us. It is estimated that Pakistan has over 12 million children who are victims of child labour.According to data compiled in 2021, the vast majority of these children are working in the agricultural sector, helping with planting and harvesting wheat and cotton. They also work in the deep sea fishing and poultry sectors. In the industrial sector, they make glass bangles, amongst other occupations. Other hazardous occupations, sometimes claiming their health and life, are coal and gemstone mining.Around 1.5m are forced to beg, while thousands are exploited as sex workers. These are damning, but not shocking, facts. There is no one in Pakistan who does not encounter small children working around them every single day. We have many laws that pretend to address the problem, but the fact that almost none of them are enforced reveals that there is widespread public acceptance of children being put to work. This is a reprehensible situation and a moral indictment of an entire country.In this atmosphere of apathy and disinterest in making things better, a few grassroots activists are trying to make a difference in the lives of these poor and exploited children. One such activist is a woman farmer called Shagufta Yasmeen.According to Shagufta, when children come to work in the fields, they are often harvesting wheat or cotton. This brings the children into contact with very strong and harmful pesticides that are being sprayed on the crop. Shagufta works with the EU-funded Clear Cotton Project, which is trying to raise awareness about the need to reduce child labour in the cotton fields and especially about the harms of pesticide exposure to children whose brains and bodies are still developing. Long-term exposure to pesticides has also been known to cause cancer and other debilitating conditions in children.In her report published in The Guardian last August, journalist Zofeen T Ebrahim asked, “How many more poor child workers must die in Pakistan before change happens?” It is a good question that has still not been answered almost a year later.In the report, the journalist recounts the death of 10-year-old Fatima Furiro who was found dead in a mansion in Khairpur. Her tortured body was later exhumed for autopsy. Furiro had been sent by her parents to work in the home of Pir Asad Ali Shah Jeelani. The postmortem confirmed that the little domestic worker had been tortured, raped and abused over a protracted period of time. Videos showing an injured Fatima struggling to sit up before collapsing went viral.Of all the child workers whose childhood and innocence are trashed when they are sent to work, little girls working in domestic settings are perhaps the most vulnerable. Educated and wealthy members of society, who otherwise espouse a great commitment to charity and to being good Muslims, regularly ignore the exploitation of these little girls, even though it takes place under their very noses every single day. Because these girls work in private spaces in the homes of people, they can easily be physically and sexually abused without any consequences for the perpetrator.In other cases, these little girl workers who are barely 10 or 11 years old themselves are employed as caregivers for small babies. As wealthy mothers’ shop, chat with friends, and eat at fancy restaurants these little girls trail them like slaves who are indentured to serve and cannot expect any just or fair treatment. Nearly everyone in cities like Karachi and Lahore has seen these little girls sitting on the side or the floor while the rest of the family enjoys a fancy meal without even thinking of feeding them.It is just this sort of dehumanisation, perpetrated by the well-educated and wealthy, that allows child labour to continue unchecked in the country. The reason that legislation, whose ostensible purpose is to end child labour and protect our young ones from the kind of brutality inflicted on little Fatima Furiro, is not implemented is because, in this land of inequality, there is no accountability of the wealthy and influential, who are, in fact, given a free pass after every atrocity they commit. When everyone thinks that exceptions can be made in the prohibition of child labour, tacit acceptance is created in society for this scourge: the children of the poor are seen as fair game when it comes to wanting things done very cheaply.The persistence of child labour and child exploitation in Pakistan is a moral issue. Despite all the commitments to goodness and charity and being faithful Muslims, people simply do not think that exploiting children is a condemnable act. This is why, even as we see children being beaten up, forced into begging, and kicked around in front of our very own eyes we do not raise our voices or punish the culprits.This extends to law enforcement and other government institutions that, too, look the other way when they should be catching and imprisoning the perpetrators, however rich and powerful.Everyone likes to condemn evil practices in theory but then they stay quiet and are, in fact, complicit in their perpetuation. Collectively, this is a moral indictment of an entire country, and reveals a deep ethical bankruptcy that sees little wrong in the failure to protect the most helpless and vulnerable in society.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nOn June 15th, Nepal's seven provinces will present unstable budgets amid challenges including frequent changes in leadership, inadequate police adjustment, reduced fiscal transfers, and limited provincial autonomy.\nWhen it arrives, it can bring both bounty and bane. However, due to a changing climate, monsoons in recent times have invariably resulted in more hardship than help. This monsoon, which arrived in Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual date, will certainly buoy farmers and provide much-needed relief from the blistering heat, but concerns over its severity still loom large. Experts have predicted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures. As this will exacerbate floods, landslides and epidemics, disaster preparedness becomes crucial.Our responses to natural disasters have consistently fallen short. Governments come and go, but the same pattern repeats every year, and hundreds of lives, and a whole lot of properties and physical infrastructure are left at nature’s mercy. Not that the country has no plans and policies for disaster preparedness. This year, as in previous ones, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has devised the Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan, which is commendable. The necessary logistics and emergency relief materials have also been stockpiled in all provinces, according to officials. The problem, however, is with the execution of these plans. This monsoon is estimated to put 1.81 million people and 412,000 households at risk, and require 18,000 rescues. These numbers are large, suggesting the necessity for a comprehensive response to disasters and ensuring that relief programmes reach the most vulnerable and needy. Lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels has also caused several problems during disasters. Local governments play a big role as primary rescuers in floods and landslides, but they are still far short in human and financial resources. The examples from the earthquake-devastated Rukum West, Sindhupalchowk and several other places highlight how Nepal fails to rehabilitate the disaster-displaced people for long periods. The residents of Rukum West are still obliged to live in houses with cracks and fissures, and experts warn that these houses could be badly damaged this monsoon. There is also high risk to those living in high landslide and flood prone areas. Unless we design approaches that include not only immediate relief programmes but also year-round relocation, rehabilitation, monitoring and study, people will continue to suffer. Also, proactive measures like public awareness and early warning should be strengthened.Moreover, monsoons are notorious for water- and vector-borne diseases, including dengue, cholera and typhoid. Dengue cases are already being reported from different parts of the country and the caseload will likely increase during and after the monsoon. Water resource contamination has surged in the past few months, leading to a higher number of water-borne disease cases in hospitals. During the monsoon preparedness, the authorities shouldn’t overlook these epidemics and focus particularly on areas that are more prone to diseases and, therefore, need timely healthcare intervention and workers.A coordinated effort from health, home, urban development and water supply ministries can help make this monsoon a lot safer. In the long run, we should find ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, which has exacerbated our climatic conditions and intensified disasters. Understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on weather will help us better prepare for future monsoons and the disasters that come in their wake.  \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal holds its general convention amidst party setbacks and scrutiny of Madhesh-based parties' performance and internal issues.\nPolitical instability in Nepal leads to frequent ambassador recalls, hindering diplomatic relations, affecting economic growth, and undermining Nepal's international standing.\nDespite adopting a federal system, Nepal's provinces face criticism due to centralized governance, provincial dependence on Kathmandu, lack of commitment to federalism, and flawed constitutional provisions, highlighting the need for improvements in implementation and mindset shifts.\nA parliamentary committee was formed to investigate the cooperative scam, despite disputes over including Deputy Prime Minister Rabi Lamichhane's name in its jurisdiction, with the probe focusing on misused funds and the involvement of individuals and companies, including Gorkha Media Network where Lamichhane invested money obtained from cooperatives.\nAmnesty International's Secretary General highlights global human rights backsliding, including shrinking civic space, weaponization of laws, increased police brutality, and impunity, affecting Nepal and other South Asian countries.\nThe CPN Unified Socialist, formed in 2021 due to a split in the CPN-UML, is preparing for its first general convention, facing criticism for poor electoral performance and a lack of service delivery despite being part of the government since its inception.\nThe UN's evolving role in Nepal's development and peace includes supporting Nepal's transition to LDC graduation, achieving SDGs, reducing poverty and inequality, addressing climate change, consolidating peace, and promoting Nepal's leadership on global platforms.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather with possible light to moderate rain and thunder/lightning in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki regions; partly cloudy to fair in rest of Nepal; with extreme heat warning in Tarai regions.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather and light to moderate rainfall with thunder and lightning are expected in parts of Nepal on Thursday, with Dhangadhi having recorded the highest temperature of 43.9 degrees Celsius on Wednesday.\nExtreme heat has gripped Nepal, with temperatures soaring above 45 degrees Celsius in some areas, while eastern districts experience relief from monsoon rains.\nPartially cloudy weather with scattered rain in some parts of Nepal, while other areas experience fair weather with temperatures ranging from 31°C in Kathmandu to 43.6°C in Nepalgunj.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.
