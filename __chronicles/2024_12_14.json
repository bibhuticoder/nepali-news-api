Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has concluded that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit was a failure as he could do nothing other than sign the agreement that was readied by the erstwhile government led by party chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal.Addressing the party’s standing committee meeting on Friday, Dahal said that the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation signed during Oli’s visit is nothing new. It was planned during his prime ministership and Oli just formalised it through the agreement.“The framework is a cut and paste of the document finalised during my prime ministership,” Ganesh Shah, the party’s secretary, quoted Dahal as saying at the meeting. “Oli couldn’t make any breakthrough during the China visit.”No party leaders questioned Dahal’s statement.The leader of the opposition had made a similar claim while addressing the party’s mass meeting in his hometown of Chitwan on Tuesday. He had claimed that Oli had been circulating the photocopies of the agreement signed during Dahal’s China visit. Dahal last visited China in September last year. After multiple rounds of negotiations, Nepal and China on December 4 signed the 10-point framework for BRI cooperation, opening doors for Chinese funds for developing projects under the BRI. The funding modalities, however, will be negotiated for each project individually. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already made public the agreement undersigned by acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.Neither Dahal nor other party leaders, however, were critical of the agreement. There was a common opinion that the signing of the framework could open the doors for the country’s development, according to leaders present at the meeting.The standing committee meeting called to finalise the agenda for the party's central committee meet slated to kick off on Tuesday ended up postponing the meet.“The central committee meeting has been deferred till January 5, 2025 due to lack of preparation,” said the party’s spokesperson Agni Sapkota. “A standing committee meeting will be held for three days starting January 2 to finalise the agenda for the central committee meeting.”The Maoist Centre is negotiating with some parties including the one led by Netra Bikram Chand for a possible merger. Dahal believes there will be some concrete progress in the merger by January 5. “In the central committee meeting, the chairman was to give a message that the party is consolidating its strength by uniting with Chand and others,” said a leader. There is a possibility that former vice-president Nanda Bahadur Pun will be given some party role—possibly vice-chair—at the upcoming central committee meeting. Pun, who has started attending the Maoist Centre’s office-bearer meetings, however, was absent from the Friday meeting.Talking to media after the meeting, Sapkota said the outcome of the recent local level bypolls has foiled the attempts of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to lead the country towards a two-party system. The Maoist Centre had won 11 out of 42 seats where the by-elections were held. Elated by the results, Dahal is preparing to present it as an indication of his party gaining ground and erosion of people’s trust towards the Congress and the UML, during the party’s central committee meeting. “The by-election results also indicate people’s increasing dissatisfaction and anger at the Congress-UML government,” said Sapkota, while making the meeting’s decisions public.In the meeting, the party leadership also decided to intervene in the leadership selection in its wing All Nepal National Independent Student Union (Revolutionary). Concluding that the union failed to hold its general convention, the party decided to pick the leadership while also imposing an age bar for student politics. After several postponements, the national jamboree of the union started in September. However, it was suspended without electing the leadership following a dispute over the selection of convention representatives and whether or not to set an age bar for the leadership. The convention that was scheduled to kick off on December 8 was postponed by the Maoist Centre’s standing committee meeting on December 5. “The party will intervene and select a new leadership in the student wing. An age bar—possibly of 30 years—will also be enforced,” a party leader told the Post. For years, the Maoist Centre’s leadership has directly picked leaders of its student wing. A group of student leaders led by vice-chair Keshab Rawal has been opposing the party’s regular interference in the union, saying, “It (the party leadership) thinks the students are its slaves and abide by whatever decision it makes.” Rawal, who had once staged a hunger strike demanding union’s general convention, has threatened a fresh protest against the party’s decision. A section of the student leaders claim Dahal is reluctant about holding the general convention fearing that his favourite candidate may lose. \nThe dispute between the Sagarmatha National Park, home to Mount Everest, and the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal over restricting helicopter sightseeing tours of the world’s tallest peak has intensified.A day after the park authorities issued directives restricting choppers from flying over the national park during Everest sightseeing tours starting January 1, the aviation regulator on Friday said the park has no legal ground to enforce such a ban.The regulator has asked the helicopter companies to continue the flights unless it decides otherwise.The dispute highlights the larger tension between Nepal’s high-end tourism and conservation in one of the world's most iconic natural regions. “We are making this unpopular decision to give justice to wildlife,” Sushma Rana, senior conservation officer of the park, which has headquarters at Namche Bazar, told the Post on Thursday. Helicopters have also been banned from transporting cargo above Pangboche at 3,985 metres above sea level.“The rule, however, will not apply to rescue flights,” said Rana.The park was established on July 19, 1976, and covers an area of 1,148 square kilometres in the Solukhumbu district. In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural treasures and unique culture, the park was put on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.Experts call the chopper ban hasty, reached without extensive consultations. They warn that it could harm Nepal’s tourism, which is still struggling to recover to pre-Covid levels. The park is also a major tourist attraction, especially for those trekking to the Everest base camp.Nearly 50,000 trekkers and mountaineers visited the national park in the last fiscal year. According to park officials, low-flying choppers cause noise pollution in wildlife habitats, which has affected animal behaviour.The most immediate concern raised by the Sagarmatha National Park is the severe noise pollution caused by frequent helicopter flights over the area. The noise disturbs animals, which rely on the park’s relatively undisturbed natural environment. Excessive noise can interfere with their feeding, breeding, and other behaviours.“The sounds can drive wild animals out of their habitats and into villages. Our studies show that accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising,” Rana said.The shy natural goral, which forages and shelters on rocky faces of mountains, has been particularly affected.“The animals jump off the cliffs in panic when choppers with loud noise fly at low altitudes. Their deaths are rising. We are doing justice to the wildlife by stopping commercial flights over the national park.”According to Rana, the park has long warned helicopters to stop haphazard landings.She said that there are over 6,000 chopper flights over the national park in the six months—spring and autumn—Nepal’s peak tourism season. Helicopter operators say the national park’s decision may severely impact high-end tourism.The Airlines Operators Association of Nepal issued a statement on Thursday criticising the decision. The civil aviation body, tour operators, and helicopter companies argue that helicopter flights are vital to the tourism industry, especially for high-end tourists who prefer a quick aerial view of the Everest region or need helicopter services for transport and rescues. Experts say there is a need to strike a balance between tourism and conservation.“National parks are an important part of our heritage, and their preservation is crucial,” said Deepak Raj Joshi, CEO of Nepal Tourism Board, the national tourism promotional body. “But the hasty decision by the Sagarmatha National Park to ban Everest sightseeing flights is nonsense. There has been no extensive discussion on this critical issue, and the ban can dent the country’s image.”He added that as tour operators make bookings in advance, such abrupt decisions will send a negative message. “Many people who have money but little time want to visit this iconic place. So we need to explore alternatives to resolve this issue.” Some experts suggest that designated flight corridors should be established to avoid key wildlife habitats.Mountaineering expert Ang Tshering Sherpa, a former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, said a tussle between two government agencies—the civil aviation body and Sagarmatha National Park—would not help improve Nepal’s tourism.“National parks are a key source of Nepal’s tourism income, and conservation should be a top priority. But the park should not impose restrictions whenever and wherever it likes as helicopters have invested billions and promote Nepal’s high-end tourism.”He said the helicopters are there for sightseeing tours, rescue and cargo transport in rugged terrain. “To strike a balance, there is a need to establish flight corridors in order to minimise noise in key wildlife habitats.” \nIn October, 27-year-old Mandeep Gurung from Dhulikhel thought he had found a respite from his struggles. Gurung (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) came to Kathmandu from Jhapa in January 2024 with the hope of a better income. But he faced months of difficulty finding a job.With the pressure of supporting his family and rent mounting, he was drawn to a sponsored Facebook post offering lucrative earnings for simple online tasks. “Earn up to Rs60,000 per month working from your phone,” the ad read.For Gurung, the promise of earning Rs60,000 a month by performing simple online tasks seemed too good to pass up.The Facebook ad led him to a Telegram group, where Gurung was welcomed by a ‘coordinator’ (fraudster posing as a Daraz subsidiary company’s coordinator) who explained the process. Tasks seemed simple enough: liking websites, subscribing to YouTube channels, and sharing promotional links. To start, however, Gurung had to deposit Rs5,000 as a ‘membership fee’.“At first, I was hesitant,” Gurung said, “but I thought, why not take a chance? They even paid me Rs1,000 after my first task, which made it seem legitimate.”Encouraged by the coordinator’s continuous lies that he would be paid double when completing higher tasks, Gurung deposited more money over the next month.In total, he invested Rs25,000—the amount he had saved for rent. The cycle abruptly ended when the coordinator asked him to recruit five new participants. Gurung was then blocked from the Telegram group.“I now feel ashamed,” Gurung said. “I trusted them because they paid me initially, but it was just a trap. My savings are gone… I don’t know what to do.”Gurung’s experience is far from unique. Employment fraud in Nepal is increasing, according to Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson and information officer for the Cyber Bureau.“These scams exploit trust and desperation. Victims are lured into schemes via platforms like Telegram, where fraudsters provide instructions for tasks that initially seem credible but eventually turn exploitative,” said Awasthi.Data from Nepal’s Cyber Bureau reveals a surge in cybercrimes, particularly electronic transaction frauds, over the past few years.In the fiscal year 2022-23, a total of 9,013 cybercrime cases were reported, with 1,835 related to electronic transaction fraud. By the following year, the number of cybercrime cases increased to 19,730 with electronic transaction fraud comprising 20.84 percent (4,112 cases) of the total, according to the bureau.This upward trend continues into the current fiscal year (2024-25), with 3,257 electronic transaction fraud cases already registered. Among these, the highest number of cases (1,186) fall under the category of ‘online job/loan’ or ‘employment fraud’ scams.The second most reported type involves ‘online shopping/online marketplace’ scams, with 1,027 cases. Additionally, 26 cases have been filed under ‘lure of foreign employment’, where victims were deceived online with false promises of overseas jobs.Aside from employment fraud, cyber scams range from e-commerce cheatings (where consumers pay but never receive goods), to phishing (impersonation of officials from some established companies like Daraz and eSewa), and even fraudulent flat rental listings.According to Awasthi, the total value of electronic transaction scams this fiscal year has reached Rs450 million. Even the report from the Financial Intelligence Unit-Nepal, ‘Cyber-Enabled Frauds under Strategic Analysis Report, 2024’ by Nepal Rastra Bank, indicated a sharp rise in fraud-related suspicious transactions in the first five months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.Fraudsters often use ads on social media platforms to lure victims into Telegram groups, according to Awasthi. There, victims like Gurung are assigned tasks that initially appear legitimate. To maintain credibility, scammers deposit small amounts of money into victims’ accounts for completed tasks.“It’s a calculated strategy,” Awasthi says. “Once trust is established, the fraudsters demand additional deposits under the guise of unlocking higher earnings. Eventually, the scammers disappear.”In some cases, victims are tricked into sharing their bank details with fake job listers or are tasked with making transactions between accounts as part of their ‘job’. These seemingly harmless tasks place the victims at the heart of illegal schemes, as the transactions occur under their names and accounts.In some instances, fraudsters entice victims with promises of small payments—like a monthly salary or a 2 percent commission—just to facilitate transactions through their bank or eSewa accounts.“Many victims are unaware that they are being drawn into fraudulent activities, and their accounts become conduits for illegal transactions,” said SP Awasthi. “When investigations unfold, these individuals find themselves already trapped in trouble, while the scammers disappear.”The Cyber Bureau understands the victims’ plight and does not penalise them, but Awasthi said that the growing volume of these cases is making it increasingly difficult to manage the situation. According to the bureau, Telegram is the primary platform used for electronic transaction fraud and scams. Investigating these cases proves challenging, as Telegram does not provide the necessary data to the Cyber Bureau.“Our only option is to trace the flow of money through bank records,” Awasthi said. “Often, when we contact the numbers traced from the bank, the calls go unanswered, or the numbers are no longer in use. It’s more complicated when the fraudsters operate from outside Nepal.”The digital landscape is expanding faster than public awareness of cybersecurity. For instance, according to a report by Nepal Rastra Bank, 70 percent of the individuals implicated in cyber-enabled fraud cases are aged between 19 and 30.These days several banks through their websites have been cautioning that it’s against the law to lend your account for others’ use or unauthorised purposes. Yet, people often fall into these traps. “While 4G has reached remote areas, awareness of internet risks hasn’t”, says Awasthi. He believes that technology should follow awareness, not the other way round. People are getting access to technology without understanding digital security, which is leading to an increase in cybercrimes and frauds. “The Cyber Bureau’s major role is to investigate crimes. While raising awareness is our concern too, we cannot do it all with limited resources… The government must seriously work to form a separate team or body to improve public awareness of these issues at the grassroots level”, adds Awasthi. \n‘Intermezzo’ is the fourth novel by Irish writer Sally Rooney. It is about the complicated lives of two brothers as they grieve the loss of their father from cancer. The story is based in Dublin and revolves around 32-year-old Peter Koubek and 22-year-old Ivan Koubek. Their parents live separately. The boys’ mother, Christine, lives with her boyfriend and children. Peter is a lawyer, whereas Ivan is a chess genius.These two brothers have a distant relationship, which further strains after their father’s death. Struggling to connect, they seek solace in romantic relationships. In the novel, we can see Ivan saying they were close when he was small. However, after he turns 16 and Peter breaks up with his high school girlfriend, Sylvia, he changes, and they grow apart. Ivan wishes for them to get back together as he thinks Sylvia has a good influence on him.Peter distracts himself with work, drugs, alcohol, and caring for two women: Sylvia, his high school girlfriend (now ex) and Naomi, a 23-year-old university student whom he is seeing at present. He had a great relationship with Sylvia, which took a turn after her accident and left her in chronic pain. For Peter’s sake, she broke up with him six years ago. But Peter isn’t over her. As he mourns his father, he also grieves for the life he and Sylvia could have had together, unable to give up their lost future. Sexual desire pushes Peter toward Naomi, who used to earn by selling her photos online. Their relationship is transactional and physical. The two women are aware of each other and have come to terms with it. Although Sylvia, now a professor of modern literature, and Peter are no longer together, they often share lunch and walk in familiar places. Peter, however, tries to keep his relationship with Naomi a secret. Sylvia is portrayed as Peter’s soulmate, someone he is comfortable and happy with, but their complicated relationship can’t work. On the other hand, while Peter cares for his girlfriend Naomi, he struggles to accept her publicly and feels guilt for being with her, as he is still not over Sylvia. Rooney also explores Peter’s mental turmoil, depicting his suicidal thoughts and reliance on drugs to sleep and escape from his real-life issues.Ivan, on the other hand, is shy and socially awkward. Once a chess prodigy who dominated major tournaments, he grapples with a career decline. He feels his career peaked during his teenage years, leaving him with little to look forward to. Despite holding a degree in theoretical physics, Ivan struggles financially, living in a shared apartment. He scrapes by with freelance data analysis work, which he detests, and spends his weekends participating in chess competitions and workshops.At a chess exhibition several hours outside Dublin, where Ivan impressively defeats ten opponents simultaneously, he meets Margaret, the event's programme director. Margaret, 14 years his senior and recently divorced from her alcoholic husband, captivates him. Their connection is born out of mutual loneliness, a rare moment where both feel seen. Despite their growing bond, the pair begin seeing each other secretly, as Margaret fears judgment from her family and friends regarding their significant age difference.At Sylvia's request, Peter invites Ivan to dinner, attempting to mend their strained relationship. During the meal, Peter tries to initiate conversations, but the evening turns tense when Ivan shares details about his new relationship with Margaret. Peter disapproves, questioning if Margaret is “normal” for dating someone so much younger and unemployed. His comments reveal his hypocrisy, as he is in a relationship with the much younger Naomi. Deeply offended, Ivan lashes out and storms out of the restaurant, shouting that he has hated Peter his entire life.As this is the first novel I’ve read by Rooney, I found her depiction of the complicated relationships between the characters compelling. The vulnerability and depth of emotions she portrays in the male characters were especially intriguing, leaving me curious about how relationships and male characters are explored in her other works.Rooney’s Irish references reveal her writing is deeply rooted in her country and culture. This book, however, demands a certain emotional readiness from its readers. It takes you through a journey of grief, pain, trauma, and tangled relationships, prompting deep reflections on life and personal connections. Yet, amidst this exploration of life’s darker moments, the book carries a message of resilience. It teaches us to embrace loss and pain, reminding us that life feels richest when we stop shielding ourselves from its realities. As she beautifully writes, “Everything exposed to light and air. Nothing protected, nothing left to be protected anymore.”The characters pose a question long after the final page: “What can life be made to accommodate, what can one life hold inside itself without breaking?” Rooney’s answer is both profound and hopeful—life, she suggests, is surprisingly vast. Like this novel, it can hold an incredible range of experiences—grief, joy, and everything.Rooney’s work consistently highlights that connections with friends, lovers, and even fleeting acquaintances are key to a meaningful life. We discover meaning through conversations, shared moments, and the stubborn pursuit of love. It’s not easy, and the characters often take unconventional paths to get there. But that’s what makes this story so relatable: the struggle, the search, and the eventual revelation that fulfilment, though elusive, is always worth chasing.Thus, ‘Intermezzo’ is a powerful exploration of love and loss. Although the first few chapters may feel confusing and lacking narrative flow, the book is worth reading. By the end, it’s not so much the plot that lingers in your mind but the characters’ emotional journey.IntermezzoAuthor: Sally RooneyYear: 2024Publisher: Faber & FaberPages: 454 \nKarnali Yaks strengthened their chances of reaching the playoff stage of the Nepal Premier League T20 cricket tournament after they defeated already-eliminated Lumbini Lions by five runs in a thrilling match at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Friday.Defending a modest 129-run target, Karnali’s disciplined bowling unit restricted Lumbini to 123-7 in the allotted 20 overs.Lumbini were looking to wrap up their campaign with a consolation win but they kept losing wickets at regular intervals, with Tom Moores’ 36 run off 35 providing the highest score of the innings.Zeeshan Maqsood spearheaded Karnali’s bowling attack with figures of 2-12 in his tight three-over spell including the wickets of skipper Rohit Paudel (10 off 8) and opener Ashutosh Ghiraiya (16 off 21).Arjun Saud (13 off 6) was the first to depart, caught by Gulsan Jha off Sompal Kami’s delivery.Lumbini were reeling at 40-3 but Moores and Sundeep Jora (24 off 21) staged a brief recovery with a 51-run stand for the fourth wicket.However, William Bosisto’s breakthrough wicket of Jora in the 13.5 overs started Lumbini’s downfall as Ben Cutting (1) and Moores were sent packing in quick succession.Saad Bin Zafar’s late cameo of 16 off 11 provided Lumbini some hopes but his run out in the 18.1 over sealed Lumbini’s fate.Earlier, invited to bat first, Karnali’s innings struggled to gain momentum, slipping to 47-4 after 10.1 overs with Dev Khanal (3), Babar Hayat (20 off 22), Gulsan Jha (8) and Chadwick Walton (13 off 15) all failing to make significant impact.Bosisto and Arjun Gharti shared a 72-run stand for the fifth wicket to steady the ship.Gharti (25 off 25) departed in the 18.5 overs after Simmonds caught and bowled him, and Bosisto (44 off 33) soon followed, trapped lbw by Bikash Aagri. Kami added a brisk 3-ball 7 to lead Karnali to 128-8.A fourth straight victory propelled Karnali to third spot, putting them firmly in contention for playoffs with eight points and one match remaining.Leaders Janakpur Bolts, on ten points, have already qualified with a match to spare.Biratnagar see off ChitwanBiratnagar Kings also kept alive their slim chances of progressing into the playoffs with a 51-run victory over Chitwan Rhinos, courtesy of an unbeaten half-century from Basir Ahamad.Biratnagar opted to bat first but got off to a disastrous start, losing Lokesh Bam (0), Dipak Bohara (4), Scott Edwaruds (0) in the space of ten balls, with Dhakal striking twice in the first over.Nicholas then departed adding just eight runs that saw Biratnagar reduced to 33-4.But Ahamad orchestrated a remarkable recovery smashing an unbeaten 68 off 44 balls and sharing a 65-run partnership with opener Martin Guptill (45 off 35) and an unbeaten 83-run stand with Rajesh Pulami (33 not out off 20) to guide Biratnagar to a commanding total of 181-5.Chitwan began their chase on a poor note with Hassan Eisakhil falling for 5. Santosh Karki (28 off 25) and Ravi Bopara (20 off 24) added 46 runs for the second wicket to revive the innings But wickets continued to tumble regularly.Sandeep Lamichhane struck twice to remove Karki and Basil Ahamad (1) and Subash Bhandari removed Bopara to keep Chitwan under pressure at 64-4.Amar Routela and Kushal Malla then led another resurgence with a 41-run stand but Chris Sole broke their stand in the 16.5 overs sending back Malla (25 off 25).Routela kept fighting with a valiant 42 off 29 but his effort proved insufficient as Chitwan could only manage 130-6.Biratngar now sit in fifth position with four points from six matches, two points behind Chitwan who dropped to fourth. \nThe three-day Nanhai Buddhism Shenzhen Roundtable kicked off in Kathmandu on Friday as over 220 Chinese Buddhist monks also arrived in Lumbini, the Buddha’s birthplace, on the same day.“Warmly welcome over 220 Chinese Buddists and practitioners arriving on a international chartered flight to Gautam Buddha International Airport in Lumbini,” Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song wrote on the social media platform X. The ambassador claimed this to be the largest ever passenger arrivals from the north at the airport which was built by Chinese contractors and funded by the Asian Development Bank.“Kicking start a new round of Buddhist cultural exchanges between Nepal and China,” wrote envoy Chen. It was keenly watched whether the China-backed Panchen Lama, whose name is Gyaincain Norbu, would make a surprise landing in Lumbini to attend a special Puja scheduled for Saturday. “But he did not arrive,” Lharkyal Lama, vice-chairman of the Lumbini Development Trust, told the Post. Other monks who arrived on Friday from Beijing will participate in a special Puja on Saturday evening on the Maya Devi temple premises. Beijing has projected Panchen Lama as the successor to Dalai Lama, a characterisation rejected by Western countries as well as Tibetans refugees in exile. Earlier too, both Lamas were trying to visit Nepal but successive governments didn’t permit them to come to Nepal and Lumbini. Earlier, Lama was reportedly preparing to use a chartered flight from Beijing to Kathmandu to attend the special function scheduled to be organised on Saturday in Lumbini. When the information of his possible arrival was leaked, the government, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote a diplomatic note to the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu to make sure that the Panchen Lama is not coming. The government also made it clear that due to the sensitivity attached to his visit, it cannot permit him to visit Nepal. The Chinese Embassy responded to the foreign ministry that “it is also sensitive towards Nepal’s concerns” so there was no plan to bring him to Nepal.The government faced a lot of external and internal pressure against hosting Lama as it goes against Nepal's stated policy of ‘non-alignment’ and “maintaining religious neutrality and respecting all religions and sects”. Rigorous checks were conducted on every passenger of the chartered flight because the Lama might hold various names and identities and possess multiple passports. The Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation gave the approval to organise the religious functions in Lumbini and in Kathmandu under the banner of Nanhai Buddhism Round Table-2024.On Friday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli inaugurated the Nanhai Buddhism Shenzhen Roundtable in Kathmandu. “We do not know why the prime minister addressed such an event that does not hold much significance,” a senior official at the prime minister’s office said.“I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Secretariat of the Nanhai Buddhism Shenzhen Roundtable for organising this remarkable forum and for inviting me to share my reflections,” said the prime minister. “The culmination of eight successful episodes of the Nanhai Buddhism Roundtable speaks to the enduring dedication of this platform towards safeguarding peace, fostering cultural exchanges, and nurturing the symphony of civilisations. “Today, as the ninth chapter unfolds here in Kathmandu, I am confident that it will deepen the bonds of friendship, inspire mutual learning, and advocate the eternal values of peace, compassion, and cooperation among Buddhist communities in Nepal, China, and beyond.This gathering holds particular significance as it takes place in Nepal, the sacred birthplace of Gautam Buddha, said the prime minister. “This land, blessed by his footsteps, symbolises a timeless bridge between the Buddhist heritage of Nepal and China, reflecting a profound spiritual and cultural connection that has flourished through centuries,” said Oli.Oli also talked about Nepal-China relations in his address saying that the countries share more than just borders as the neighbours are bound by the timeless tapestry of history, the majestic embrace of mountains, the life-giving flow of rivers, and the profound richness of cultures. Buddhism has been the luminous thread that weaves together the spiritual and cultural fabric of the two nations, fostering an enduring bond of harmony and understanding, said the prime minister. “From the ancient journeys of the Chinese monks Fa Xian and Xuan Zang to Nepal, to the enlightening visit of Nepali scholar Buddhabhadra to China, our shared history is replete with exchanges of wisdom and learning,” he added. The architectural marvels of Nepali-style Buddhist temples in China and the grandeur of the Zhong Hua Chinese Buddhist Monastery in Lumbini stand as eternal monuments to this enduring connection, said Oli.“It fills my heart with pride to acknowledge the role of Lumbini Buddhist University in Nepal, a beacon of knowledge dedicated to Buddhist studies. The collaborative engagements between this institution and the Nanhai Buddhist Academy in China exemplify the spirit of partnership and shared aspiration.In his address to the monks from China, Thailand and Cambodia, the prime minister expressed his confidence that these bonds will grow stronger in the days to come, enriching the legacy of our shared heritage. \nNepal’s contradictory energy policies expose the hollow rhetoric of our top political leaders. KP Sharma Oli, the current Prime Minister and chair of the CPN-UML, retracted the proposal to transport liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs) from India to Chitwan during his previous premiership in 2020, claiming that the country is working to increase hydropower capacity as an alternative to cooking gases. Yet, the same party’s Minister for Industry, Damodar Bhandari, recently visited New Delhi to discuss a gas pipeline project. Although Nepal initially requested the LPG pipeline project (from Motihari in India to Sarlahi in Nepal) to be built with a grant from its southern neighbour, insiders are sceptical that such an ambitious undertaking can be hard without a long-term agreement. Such actions show that we as a country are nowhere close to prioritising green energy. On paper, Nepal plans to produce more than 28,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 as part of its green, renewable energy ambition. But, in practice, it is desperately lobbying for a multi-million dollar cross-border LPG pipeline project with India, supporting a continued reliance on imported fossil fuels. What our policymakers seem to be ignoring are the risks fossil fuels pose to the environment and the setbacks they cause to the overall development of hydropower in the country. Evidently, reducing the reliance on LPGs would save the country more than Rs50 billion—which was spent on importing cooking gas in the last fiscal year—which in turn would also make a big dent in the country’s ever-rising trade deficit. Moreover, compared to the LPG, electricity-powered stoves are more sustainable, environmentally friendly and cost-effective. But rather than cut their supply and imports in the country, policymakers are looking for ways to make them easily and widely available. The pouring of billions into the gas project will make the path for the establishment of additional hydropower projects in the country more difficult. Despite having the potential to produce 40,000 megawatts, the country currently generates just around 3,000 megawatts. So experts warn that the hydropower potential is at risk of being undermined by the government’s investment in fossil fuel infrastructure. At present, 44.3 percent of households in the country rely on LPG for cooking, and only 0.5 percent use electricity for the purpose, despite a surplus of hydroelectricity even during off-peak seasons. The government will require $25 billion to meet its target of replacing 25 percent of LPGs with electric stoves by 2030. Nepal is also looking to install 500,000 improved cooking stoves with a focus on rural areas. These green goals, unfortunately, are bound to get sidelined due to the LPG pipeline project. It is not that the electric cooking vision doesn’t have challenges. There are issues of frequent power cuts and low voltages. Similarly, even though Nepal’s national grid has expanded to almost 95 percent of the country’s households, five percent are still left in the lurch. This again highlights the need to ensure uninterrupted electricity for all. It is high time the government gave up the temptation of short-term LPG gains and aligned its strategies with the vision of making electric stoves one of the primary cooking methods by 2030. The country’s energy security and environment are not the things that the government can take lightly.  \nIn the era of artificial intelligence (AI), media professionals often encounter questions about the importance of journalism. With AI algorithms increasingly dictating content and influencing societal perspectives, misinformation and disinformation have become rampant. The monetisation of many social media platforms has led to the production and circulation of viral content, regardless of their credibility and accuracy. So, professional journalism’s need to act as a firewall against fake news, deepfakes, context-free information and other forms of misleading content has become more crucial. Journalism is one of the most essential professions for maintaining public trust, particularly in developing nations like ours with low media and information and communication technology (ICT) literacy. The foundational principles of journalism—truth, transparency, accountability, information verification and ethical reporting—must be the guiding tenets for an informed society in the age of AI.Misinformation in the digital landscapeSeveral social media platforms, including Facebook, YouTube and X, have been criticised for their role in rapidly disseminating misinformation, disinformation and propaganda, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, misinformation on pandemic prevention methods, such as the unfounded claim that turmeric water could cure the virus, spread rapidly in Nepal and beyond. On April 26, Sidhakura.com, a Nepali news portal, published fabricated audio entitled “The Dark Files”, raising considerable concern among stakeholders on the potential misuse of AI technology. These digital platforms use algorithms that optimise user engagement, often prioritising sensational and polarising content over factual accuracy. Concurrently, generative AI’s advent has disrupted media practices and altered journalistic gatekeeping processes.Generative AI has become one of the most deceptive threats to journalism since we wholeheartedly accept its outputs. This is called technological somnambulism, a philosophical concept that illustrates our tendency to be unaware of how technology is changing the conditions of human existence. These fake, hyper-realistic audiovisuals have been exploited to manipulate public opinion, tarnish reputations and interfere with electoral processes. In March 2022, shortly after the Russia-Ukraine war began, Russian agents produced a deepfake video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, allegedly ordering his troops to surrender to the Russian army. In June, the White House administration reported that President Joe Biden had fallen victim to a deepfake video. Biden admitted in a press conference that he could not recognise a deepfake video of his own at first glance. These instances highlight how the rapidly advancing AI-powered tools undermine the public’s hard-won trust in established media and journalistic practices. Without journalistic intervention, these manipulative tools could mislead substantial segments of the population. Investigating and verifying such claims remains vital in combating the infodemic propagated on digital platforms. So, AI tools cannot supplant the need for professional journalism in any society. Journalism over AI-generated contentIn several workshops focused on the impact of AI on journalism, in which I participated, many journalists reported utilising several AI tools, including ChatGPT, Midjourney and Google Gemini, for content creation, restructuring and copy-editing of news reports. However, they seldom disclosed their use of AI in news production. While the automation of content generation enhances efficiency, it fails to uphold transparency, contextual understanding and ethics. Further, it can create echo chambers and reinforce existing biases. For example, algorithmic biases in search engines, as highlighted by Johanna Burai’s “The World White Web” campaign against the prevailing whiteness of the Internet, along with Latanya Sweeney’s research on discriminatory advertisement delivery based on racial names, underscore the dangers of perpetuating stereotypical perceptions.In contrast to AI tools, human reporters can investigate complex societal issues, comprehend cultural sensitivities and contextualise stories in ways that algorithms cannot. According to a 2024 study by Pew Research Centre, a US-based think-tank organisation, majority of Americans still trust professional journalists more than AI-generated content. In 2023, after introducing AI news anchors on Indian television, local audiences were asked about their perceptions of automated news content and AI-powered news anchors. Many of the respondents expressed their frustrations over the mechanical news anchoring. Moreover, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation, stated that professional journalism has become essential, as it has played a fundamental role in dispelling myths and clarifying scientific information about the pandemic.Journalism's relevanceOne of the most critical functions of journalists is acting as watchdogs for those in power. AI tools or social media platforms cannot replace this as they are not designed for it. For example, investigative journalism—whether uncovering the US Watergate scandal in 1972 or exposing the fake Bhutanese refugee scam involving the government agencies of Nepal—demands the professionalism and expertise of human journalists. Originality cannot be replicated by algorithms prioritising engagement metrics, financial gains, or serving political agendas over societal well-being. Journalism should be responsible for scrutinising these systems, exposing their biases, and advocating for ethical technological development. As AI-powered tools can provide substantial assistance in data analysis, fact-checking and audience engagement, they must act as complementary tools in journalism. This will allow journalists to dedicate more time to in-depth storytelling and investigative reporting. News organisations must innovate with AI tools while upholding their commitment to the public good. When employed responsibly, AI has the potential to enhance sustainable journalism, helping it thrive in an increasingly complex media landscape.  \nDonald Trump’s victory in November’s US presidential election saw the US dollar strengthen. It surged to a one-year high within two weeks, and has since retained its strength against its major peers. His election has also again brought the prospect of US tariffs on imports, and attention has focused on the disruption to global trade that these may bring.As part of this, Trump made a not-so-veiled threat of steep levies on the Brics group of leading emerging markets should they create a rival to the US dollar, which has been the world’s “dominant currency” since the second world war.The use and holding of the US dollar by other countries is known as dollarisation. It has different levels of meaning, from countries like Panama using the US dollar as their currency, to its use in the pricing of major internationally traded commodities, and as a reserve and vehicle currency. This latter role enhances global trade.Take Chile and Malaysia as an example. Any trade between these two countries will involve the exchange of Chilean pesos for Malaysian ringgit, for which there is not a large and active market. So, pesos are instead exchanged for US dollars and US dollars for ringgit, allowing trade to occur in a quicker and more cost-efficient manner.Indeed, the US dollar is used in more than 50 percent of foreign trade invoices, and over 80 percent of all foreign exchange transactions worldwide. However, it is possible that Trump’s “America First” foreign policy could serve to hasten the end of the US dollar’s dominance.Pros and consDollarisation is beneficial for global trade. But it brings particular benefits to the US, as other countries need to hold US dollars to facilitate trade and pay for many commodities. This means that demand for the US dollar remains high, so it does not come under pressure to depreciate.A more important point is perhaps that when countries buy US dollars, they don’t hold them in cash. Rather, they buy US Treasury bills and so, in effect, lend money to the US government. This high demand for US Treasuries means the US government is able borrow at a cheaper rate than would otherwise be possible.However, there are also drawbacks. A strong US dollar increases the price of dollar-denominated commodities and thus the cost of international trade. And for the US itself, a strong US dollar can damage its domestic export business.These drawbacks have often led to the suggestion of a multi-currency global system, although this has never gained traction or been a serious consideration. But that could change with a second Trump presidency.During his first term, such calls grew louder. And there have been some shifts in US dollar holdings since then, to the extent that global US dollar reserves have declined.So, which Trump policies could hasten the end of US dollar dominance? The incoming president is regarded as pro-business, which will probably translate into policies aimed at lowering regulation and taxes. Stimulating domestic growth will lead to an even stronger US dollar at a time when global output is more modest.A stronger US dollar, as mentioned above, also increases the price of oil and similar commodities. Countries will inevitably ask themselves why oil from Saudi Arabia, for example, should be paid for in US dollars as those dollars become more expensive.Trump’s economic policies are likely to increase US debt, and this can reduce the value of the large US dollar reserves held around the world. According to one study, Trump’s plans could add as much as US$15 trillion (£11.7 trillion) to the nation’s debt over a decade. A fall in the value of US dollar reserves may result in some countries being less willing to hold US debt.The effect of these policies might be considered unintentional. But other policies, such as Trump’s plan for higher tariffs, are more deliberately designed.A strong US dollar damages US exports, as they become relatively expensive in local currency terms, and makes imports relatively cheap. Tariffs are a way to protect domestic producers from this international competition.However, assuming no other country retaliates, raising tariffs will serve only to further strengthen the US dollar, as fewer imports will mean less US dollars being sold in the foreign exchange market. This will, at least in part, undo the effect of the tariff policy while imposing trade costs globally.To avoid elements of this, countries could agree to use alternatives as a reserve currency and a means to pay for international commodities. The BRICS nations have mooted a separate currency, which could revolve around one or more existing currencies like the Euro or Yuan. Trump’s threats may simply speed up this search for an alternative.What would this mean for the US?Countries would then need to hold less US dollars, so would sell off their US Treasuries. The result will be a rise in the cost of debt for the US, and a fall in the value of the US dollar. Ironically, this would increase the price of imports (the goal of Trump’s tariff policy), but it could also lead to inflation.In a worst-case scenario, should countries coordinate their selling of US dollars and Treasuries, a run on the US dollar would have major implications for the US and the world. This would lead to higher debt costs in the US and a need to reduce its trade deficit.Globally, it would disrupt trade, raise transaction costs, and there would be a loss of value for any dollar-denominated assets and reserves. This would most likely culminate in a significant global recession.The US dollar will remain a global currency for the foreseeable future. But Trump’s “America First” policy, as well as the greater weaponisation of the US dollar, could lead to its relegation from being the only world currency.-The ConversationRead the full article here. \nA section of the Nepali Congress leaders and cadres has stepped up pressure on party leadership to hold the 15th general convention in December next year, in line with the provisions of the party statute. As the party establishment is yet to start the process of holding conventions of local chapters in the lead up to the main event next year, members from the rival faction have, in the past couple of weeks, intensified their campaign. This is the right thing to do in order to keep the party on the right track and add dynamism to the organisation. Timely conventions are vital for the health of party organizations and to rejuvenate cadres. Party members—old and new—want a predictable system of holding general convention and electing leaders, from the grassroots to the centre, through healthy competition.A general convention may seem a purely internal matter of the concerned party. But it’s an issue of public concern as well. In a republican system, political parties lead the government. From lawmakers to ministers, chief ministers to prime ministers, all come from political parties. Politicians also choose everyone from heads of constitutional bodies to the heads of state. So the importance of who leads the political parties and how they are elected goes beyond the immediate party circles. This is especially true of the leaders of the big parties like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML. Strengthening intra-party democracy is the only way to ensure that wrong people don’t make it to the parties’ leadership. Timely election of leaders, from the local to the central level, makes a political party stronger and by extension strengthens democracy. If history is any guide, the political parties that have cultivated strong intra-party democracy have succeeded in national politics as well.The Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, has of late adopted some progressive practices. For instance, earlier, the party president had the authority to pick one of the two general secretaries and a vice-president. The party chiefs would invariably handpick their loyalists. But starting the last general election, the country’s grand-old-party started electing both the general secretaries and all vice-presidents through direct voting of convention delegates. That helped two relatively young leaders—Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma—become party general secretaries. This development had greatly boosted confidence among the party’s youths. In sum, these progressive practices added vigour to the Congress. But the party has consistently failed to hold its conventions on time. The party charter has a provision that allows the office-bearers to serve for an additional year if the organisation faces an unforeseen crisis. But the Congress leadership has embraced this term extension as a normal thing, rather than see it as an exception. So it is only right that this time there is pressure on the party establishment to follow the charter and bring the derailed system back on track. As Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba is not running for the party’s executive role again, he would perhaps want to bow out as the president who did his bit to strengthen internal democracy and hand over the party’s reins to a competent successor.  \nIn a must-win match of the Nepal Premier League (NPL), Pokhara Avengers set a target of 139 runs for Kathmandu Gurkhas at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Thursday.Winning the toss, Kathmandu chose to field first, restricting Pokhara to 138 runs for the loss of 8 wickets in the allotted 20 overs. Middle-order batter Raymon Reifer remained unbeaten with 41 runs off 30 balls, hitting one four and three sixes. Opener Dinesh Kharel scored 38 runs off 25 balls, including six fours and a six, before being trapped lbw by Rashid Khan.Dilip Nath added 27 runs but was bowled by Rashid. Other batters failed to reach double figures, with Andries Gous and Narayan Joshi dismissed for ducks. Captain Kushal Bhurtel managed only 7 runs, while Michael Leask contributed 1 before falling lbw to Karan KC.For Kathmandu, Rashid Khan and Karan KC led the bowling attack, each taking three wickets. Gerhard Erasmus and Michael Levitt claimed a wicket apiece.The match is critical for both teams as they vie for a spot in the playoffs. \nA defiant South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol faces a second impeachment vote on Saturday over his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, a move that shocked the country, split his party and imperilled his presidency half way through his term.His move to impose military rule on Dec. 3 was rescinded barely six hours later after parliament defied troops and police to vote against the decree, but it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and triggered widespread calls for him to step down for breaking the law.Opposition parties plan to hold an impeachment vote at 4 p.m. (0700 GMT) on Saturday, with large demonstrations planned ahead of the vote.Yoon’s conservative People Power Party boycotted the first impeachment vote a week earlier, preventing a quorum.Since then, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon has urged party members to vote for impeachment on Saturday, and at least seven PPP members have said they would vote to impeach.The opposition parties control 192 of the 300 seats in the single-chamber parliament so they need at least eight PPP votes to reach the two-thirds threshold for impeachment.Ahn Cheol-soo, a PPP lawmaker among those backing Yoon’s impeachment, said in a Facebook post on Saturday that he would vote for impeachment “for the sake of swift stabilization of people’s livelihood, economy and diplomacy.”The PPP floor leader said on Friday, however, that the party’s stance is still to oppose impeachment.PPP lawmakers are due to meet on Saturday morning to decide whether to change that position.If impeached, Yoon would lose authority but remain in office until the Constitutional Court either removes or reinstates him. In the meantime, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would serve as acting president.If the court removes Yoon or he resigns, a presidential election must be held within 60 days.Yoon is separately under criminal investigation for alleged insurrection over the martial law declaration and authorities have banned him from travelling overseas.He has not signalled a willingness to resign and in a speech on Thursday vowed he would “fight to the end” and defended the martial law decree as necessary to overcome political deadlock and protect the country from domestic politicians who are undermining democracy.Yoon, president of Asia’s fourth-largest economy, hopes political allies will rally to support him, but the fiery remarks appeared to find mixed reception among PPP lawmakers.A Gallup Korea poll on Friday had two-thirds of supporters of Yoon’s party opposing the impeachment, though three-quarters of all respondents supported it.Elected in 2022, Yoon was widely welcomed in Washington and other Western capitals for his rhetoric defending global democracy and freedom, but critics said that masked growing problems at home.He clashed with opposition lawmakers that he has labelled as “anti-state forces” and press freedom organisations have criticized his heavy-handed approach to media coverage that he deems negative.The crisis and ensuing uncertainty shook financial markets and threatened to undermine South Korea’s reputation as a stable, democratic success story.South Korean shares rose for a fourth straight session on Friday on hopes that the political uncertainty would ease after this weekend’s parliamentary impeachment vote. \nMost parts of Nepal will experience clear skies on Saturday, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.The day is expected to remain partly cloudy in the hilly regions of Koshi Province, while the rest of the country will enjoy mostly sunny weather. During the night, weather conditions are forecast to be mostly clear nationwide. The Division has warned of dense fog in the morning in several areas of the Terai and the Kathmandu Valley, which could temporarily disrupt transportation and daily activities. Authorities have advised caution to mitigate potential impacts. Nepal experienced clear skies on Friday, with Janakpur recording the highest temperature at 27.5°C and Jumla the lowest at -7.0°C, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division. \nIndian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has expressed deep satisfaction regarding the present status of “extremely robust bilateral ties” between Nepal and India. “He also conveyed that, as close neighbours, India and Nepal share similar perspectives on many issues of mutual concern,” the Ministry of Defence of India said in a statement issued after Chief of Army Staff of Nepal Ashok Raj Sigdel called on Singh in New Delhi on Thursday. “He [Singh] reiterated India’s intent to strengthen relations with its neighbours, in tune with the ‘neighbourhood first policy’.During the meeting they held discussions on a number of issues pertaining to bilateral relations, according to the ministry. Singh highlighted the various facets of defence cooperation including training, regular exercises, workshops and seminars to enhance the capability of Nepal Army as well as supply of defence equipment and stores, read the statement.Minister Singh congratulated the Chief of Army Staff of Nepal Sigdel on the conferment of honorary rank of General of the Indian Army. Nepali Army chief Sigdel, who is on a four-day visit to India, was conferred the Honorary Rank of General of the Indian Army by Indian President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday.This gesture continues the seven-decade-long tradition between Nepal and India of honouring each other's army chiefs with honorary ranks, reflecting the deep-rooted and strategic ties between the two nations’ armed forces.Sigdel’s visit follows Indian Army Chief General Dwivedi’s visit to Nepal in the third week of November. During the visit he was similarly conferred with the honorary rank of General of the Nepali Army by President Ramchandra Paudel. \nSadbhav Acharya won the Surya Nepal Kathmandu Open for his fourth major career title at the par-68 Royal Nepal Golf Club on Friday.Acharya came from one-shot down to beat pro Niraj Tamang by two strokes in the second event under the Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25. Nepal number one amateur golfer Acharya carded an impressive 6-under 62 to post the record winning total of 15-under 257 at the RNGC course, bettering Bhuvan Nagarkoti’s previous best of 14-under in the 2022-23 season.Tamang carded 3-under 65 in the final round and finished first among pros with the score of 13-under 259. He received a cheque of Rs125,000. Dinesh Prajapati finished third overall and second among pros with the score of 8-under 264 after he carded 3-under 65 in the final round. He earned Rs85,000.Rahul BK was fourth overall and second among amateurs after he carded 4-under 64 for a total score of 6-under 266. Nepal number one pro Bhuvan Nagarkoti was fifth overall and third among pros at 4-under 268. He carded 4-under 64 in the final round and claimed Rs68,000. Bishnu Prasad Sharma and Jayram Shrestha shared the sixth place at 3-under 269. Shrestha carded six straight birdies from the 13th to 18th holes on his way to carding 6-under 62, while Sharma played 3-over 71. They received Rs51,500 each. Sanjay Lama, Deepak Magar and Toran Bikram Shahi finished in top 10.Acharya took the turn at 4-under 30 and carded 2-under 32 on the back nine. He started the day with a birdie and added three more on the fourth, fifth and sixth holes. After taking the turn, he carded birdies on the 11th and 13th holes. Acharya did not drop a single shot on the last 47 holes and recorded a nine-stroke victory over BK in the amateur section.Overnight leader Tamang carded 4-under 30 on the front nine and played 1-over 35 on the back nine. He carded four birdies on the first, second, fourth and seventh holes and he dropped a shot on the 11th hole.Prajapati carded 2-under 32 on the front nine and he played 1-under 33 on the back nine. He carded birdies on the first, fourth, fifth and eighth holes, while he faced a double bogey on the seventh hole. Prajapati then carded birdies on the 10th and 13th holes before dropping a shot on the 14th hole.A total of 45 players—33 pros and 12 amateurs—took part in the tournament that carried a cash purse of Rs735,000. The next event of the Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, Surya Nepal Eastern Open, will be played at Dharan Golf Club from December 25-28. \nThe World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on Thursday approved a $100 million development policy operation (DPO) to help Nepal enhance its ongoing efforts to implement green, resilient, and inclusive development. The World Bank said in a statement that this is the second in a programmatic series of three DPOs designed to strengthen the enabling environment for Nepal’s sustainability pathway. “This programmatic DPO series is a catalyst for Nepal to build greater resilience and sustainability and drive and protect the basis for long-term growth for all Nepalis,” said David Sislen, World Bank regional country director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. “This operation supports Nepal’s policy programme in a variety of sectors, including green fiscal instruments, water security, irrigation, land use and management, sustainable forest management, and climate and disaster information systems.” Since 2021, the government has undertaken an ambitious programme of action focusing on environmental sustainability, resilience, and inclusive development. This approach, according to the statement, addresses intertwined challenges such as joblessness, pandemics, expanding economic opportunities for vulnerable groups, and climate and other environmental risks affecting Nepal’s people, prosperity, and environment. “The World Bank DPO series anchors Nepal’s ongoing shift to a more sustainable development path. Nepal’s policies supported by the DPO series arose from stakeholder dialogues and the nation’s own development priority programmes and plans,” the statement reads. It says that these policies aim to improve air quality, expand hydro-meteorological services for better disaster risk reduction, improve water security by boosting year-round irrigation and safe water supply, strengthen community forest management, and enhance land use planning.“Nepal continues to put in place a strong policy programme that recognises that resilience is best achieved when sustainability and inclusion are also pursued in an integrated way,” said Stephen Danyo, World Bank programme leader for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka and task team leader for the operation. \nBiratnagar Kings registered a commanding 51-run victory over Chitwan Rhinos in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Friday.Biratnagar opted to bat first after winning the toss, but their decision was quickly tested as they lost early wickets. Lokesh Bam was dismissed for a duck in the first over, and Dipak Bohara followed soon after for four. The Kings were in deep trouble at 4-2 in the first over.Scott Edwards failed to make an impact, departing for a golden duck, and Biratnagar were reeling at 10-3. However, Martin Guptill (45 off 35 balls) and Basir Ahamad (68 not out off 44 balls) steadied the ship with a crucial 88-run partnership. Ahamad’s power-hitting, including four boundaries and two sixes, gave the Kings the momentum they desperately needed.The pair guided Biratnagar to 98-4 by the 14th over. Ahamad and Rajesh Pulami (33 not out off 20 balls) then unleashed a flurry of boundaries, adding 83 unbeaten runs in quick time. Pulami’s rapid-fire knock ensured Biratnagar finished with a formidable total of 181-5 in 20 overs.Chasing 182, Chitwan started on a poor note. Hassan Eisakhil was trapped lbw by Basir Ahamad for 5, and Santosh Karki (28 off 25 balls) was caught by Basir off Sandeep Lamichhane, leaving the Rhinos at 56-2. Ravi Bopara’s departure for 20 off 24 balls, dismissed by Subash Bhandari, further hindered Chitwan’s progress.Kushal Malla (25) fell to Chris Sole, and the Rhinos were 64-4 in the 11th over. Basil Hameed was dismissed for 1, leaving Chitwan at 64/5. Amar Routela played a defiant knock of 42 off 29 balls but could not carry his side home. Once he was dismissed with the score at 129-6, the result was sealed.Chitwan finished at 130-6, falling short by 51 runs. Biratnagar’s bowlers, led by Lamichhane and Ahamad, kept the pressure on throughout the chase, ensuring a comfortable victory.This is Biratnagar’s second win in the NPL. With this victory, Biratnagar has garnered 4 points from six matches, keeping their slim hopes of making it to the playoffs alive.On the other hand, Chitwan suffered their third defeat in six matches, dealing a significant blow to their playoff aspirations. With six points from six matches, Chitwan remains in fourth place. \nSeven years and seven months after inking the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Nepal and China on Wednesday signed a framework for BRI cooperation during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit, which ends on Thursday.Acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the framework cooperation on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said. \nNepali officials were paid $2.5 million in bribes to seal the contract for the $209.6-million Airbus deal, the largest in Nepal’s aviation history, charging documents filed in the US court show.Deepak Sharma, a former executive of the US-based aviation services provider AAR, pleaded guilty in July earlier this year to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) anti-bribery provisions. The charges were based on allegations that Sharma was part of a conspiracy to bribe Nepali officials to secure two Airbus A330 deals in 2017.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.Sharma, a Nepal-born British citizen, joined AAR in 2015. Before this, he was the chief technical officer at AJW Group, which he joined in 2008. He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1]. Let me know if you want any changes made to the payment terms or bid terms so that it favours [Company 1]. I can ask these to be incorporated [sic] into the RFP for publication. I am meeting with the [Foreign Official 1] and Chairman this week…”On or about September 1, 2016, approximately one month before Nepal Airlines Corporation publicly issued the RFP, Foreign Official 1 sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify MOU signing date, purchase agreement date and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor of Company 1] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, Foreign Official 1 texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”On May 15, 2018, Sharma sent Individual 1 a text message about Intermediary and Foreign Official 1 pressuring to pay Company 5’s invoice, writing, “The Nepali guys is [sic] chasing like hell.”On May 17, 2018, Sharma sent an email to Individual 1 with an attached invoice from Company 5 to Company 3 for $450,000 for “Service Provided for Bid and Sale of X2A330 as an Advance.”On July 3, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused a wire transfer of approximately 390,000 EURO (the equivalent of roughly $450,000) from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, in part for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1On August 9, 2018, the Intermediary emailed Sharma, attaching two invoices from Company 5 to Company 3 for $1,000,000 each for “Service Provided for Bid and sale of X2 A330 as an Advance.”On August 10, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused two wire transfers of approximately $1,000,000 each from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, partly for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1. \nNepal has almost everything it needs for prosperity: A strategic location, tourism potential, hydropower and a young population. Yet, we are trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth and high migration. When the Constitution was finally promulgated two decades after the launch of the Maoist People’s War, we expected politics to be our salvation. Unfortunately, it has become our prison.Nepal's low-growth, high-migration trap isn't just an economic phenomenon—it's a political protection mechanism that preserves an unsustainable kleptocracy and crony capitalism. While the World Bank calls for a “systematic assault” on economic barriers, what Nepal needs is a paradigm shift that will fundamentally transform power relations and dismantle extractive networks.Without such a shift, emerging political agency and a growing structural crisis will create a rupture. The absence of comprehensive political and economic reforms is a matter of serious concern for Nepalis. It does not just affect our graduation to a middle-income status, which has already been pushed behind schedule; it also impacts the lives of millions of people and determines Nepal’s development trajectory.The trapSince the World Bank's initial analysis in 2017, Nepal's “low-growth, high-migration trap” has deepened. According to the World Bank, low-growth fails to generate employment. As a result, a large number of youth are forced to migrate. Migration brings in remittance, enabling consumption but no productive investment. High remittance not only creates economic distortions, but also reduces pressure on the top leaders to deliver reforms. The lack of reforms, in turn, reinforces low growth.Despite poverty reduction, Nepal has been growing at only about 4 percent, marginally better than the 2 percent growth achieved in 2023. At this rate, Nepal will be unable to graduate from LDC at least until 2030.Nepal’s economic trends and fiscal positions are becoming increasingly unsustainable, creating pressures for change. For example, budget execution rates are below 80 percent, revenue collection is dwindling, capital expenditure is low, and the debt service burden is rising.While the per capita income remains at around $1,400, limiting job creation, the manufacturing sector’s GDP share has shrunk by half since 2008. While migration is increasing, fiscal indicators are worsening. Our dependence on migration is growing. While public debt is about 44 percent of the GDP, our revenues are shrinking. Debt servicing and financial management consume almost 20 percent of the budget, while development expenditure has shrunk to 19 percent and is poorly executed.Political agencyThe kleptocracy, patronised by top political leaders, extracts power and money from the people and the state. In doing so, they misuse state power, distort its bodies and hollow out legal institutions. Despite this, political agency has failed to drive change.Institutions like the World Bank have been advocating comprehensive reforms. For example, they want to break policy barriers, build new growth sources, revitalise agriculture, address migration issues and unleash financial reforms. These reforms would make the economy more competitive, productive and broad-based. All of these recommendations directly impact the existing extractive system dominated by crony capitalism, kleptocracy and political parties. Initiating changes would mean changing the status quo, which is why these suggestions fail.The failure of new parties to put pressure on traditional parties has not helped. When the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) emerged just before the 2022 elections, it was largely driven by the aspirations of migrant workers. However, the ethical dilemma posed by evidence of corruption of RSP’s founder has dented the party’s aspirations. When the current coalition was forged, one of the objectives was to deliver results to the people to show them that there was no need for new parties. This strategy has failed. However, the new parties have met the same fate, ultimately benefiting the entrenched leaders. One of the results of this mismatch between people’s expectations and political delivery is the reluctance of people to identify themselves with a political party. Rather, the disenchantment and dissatisfaction echo in social media in fragmented ways. Activism has not worked because people have become distrustful of not only political parties but also activists who claim to represent civil society.Incremental reforms?There are enough people who believe that incremental reforms in the economy will add up and drive change. Some people are also hopeful that the traditional parties are feeling the pressure and will reform, albeit slowly. Then there are others who think we must seek alternatives to the current political system. Many of them tout China as a model of growth and aspire to have “political stability.”None of these approaches will work, unfortunately.Traditional solutions offered by donors and development partners often fail because they cannot address political-economy factors and political dynamics. These solutions focus on the symptoms rather than the root causes. Incremental reforms are often absorbed by the system, with all its deformities. And when the reforms are significant, the kleptocracy swiftly neutralises the attempts.For a few years, the traditional political parties could create the illusion of change, but all that the superficial democracy did was maintain the status quo. The current political system is rooted in extractive kleptocracy because the parties need each other to survive. Reforms will undermine the sources of political power and wealth. Therefore, political reform is impossible without disrupting the existing political power models.The current political malaise has discredited the whole democratic system. Seeking an alternative to the democratic system, however, is not an option. According to renowned economists, democracies perform at least 20 percent better than non-democracies in delivering prosperity. Democracies can also deliver more investment, economic reforms and public goods.A likely ruptureYes, the emergence of new political forces has faltered. Yet, this is only a temporary blip. At least four quarters are pressing for transformation in our political and economic system: the migrant population, urban youth, a traditionalist nationalist force allied with the former monarchy and a liberal-minded civil society. Even if political agency and social movements have failed to produce well-thought-out political movements, structural factors will continue to push for change because the status quo is untenable, and it is little prepared for shocks that may come from unexpected quarters.New structural pressures are building: Demographic transition creates new demands, digital transformation rearranges political psychology and regional economic integration forces competitiveness. Demographic pressures, economic vulnerabilities, migration impacts and urbanisation pressures will continue to generate strain until the status quo breaks.Our hope is that political agency and the structural crisis will align so that we are able to manage the transformation in a meaningful way. Otherwise, instability and chaos will become unavoidable. \nThe debut edition of the Nepal Premier League Twenty20 cricket tournament is set to kick off on Saturday with a festive atmosphere and with so much anticipation that it could write a new chapter in Nepali cricket.Billed as the ‘Festival of Himalayas’, the NPL has already attracted global interest, with the likes of former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan and New Zealand allrounder James Neesham, among other big cricketing names, set to light up the eight-team competition that will run until December 21.The involvement of Star Sports Network—a group of Indian television sports channels that also holds the rights of flagship tournaments like Indian Premier League, English Premier League, Wimbledon and ICC events—as the official broadcasting partner will now give the league a worldwide exposure.Partnership with Twenty-first Century Media (TCM) Sports—a sports management company that has managed Cricket World Cups, Asia Cups, IPL and other international events—is further evidence that the NPL aspires to evolve into one of the major cricketing events in the world.Organiser Cricket Association of Nepal appears determined to make the league a landmark event, aiming to propel Nepali cricket into an unprecedented era of growth and global recognition.“The organisation of the NPL is itself a big achievement for CAN and Nepali cricket,” CAN Spokesperson Chhumbi Lama told the Post.“For the first time, our domestic tournament will be broadcast worldwide, making the NPL the ideal platform to elevate Nepali cricket to the international stage,” Lama added. “The inaugural league could be a catalyst for Nepali cricket’s golden era.”CAN has laid out ambitious plans to expand the league in future editions, including multi-venue matches, games under floodlights, and a potential home-and-away format within five years.“This year, the NPL will be hosted at TU Cricket Ground, but as eight cricket stadiums are currently under construction, we plan to expand to cities outside the Kathmandu Valley,” Lama said. “If floodlights are installed at TU Ground, the future matches will be even more spectacular.”CAN has also developed a comprehensive business strategy to ensure the league’s sustainability, with goals to attract government investment and international grants.“This will take Nepali cricket into a commercial era, paving the way for further development of the game,” Lama added. CAN is making another effort to establish its own franchise league in the country following a debacle of its previous venture. It had organised Nepal T20 League in the 2022/23 season but the tournament proved a disaster as it was overshadowed by spot-fixing allegations, resulting in the involvement of Central Investigation Bureau and several arrests.CAN also faced criticisms for its mismanagement, negligence and incompetence. Eventually, the contract with Seven3Sports, to which the tournament rights were sold for eight years without a competitive bidding process, had to be terminated.This time, CAN, in its renewed effort to establish a successful franchise cricket league, seems committed to implementing stringent measures to safeguard the integrity of the NPL.Retired AIG Ishwor Babu Karki, who is the Head of Integrity at CAN and oversees anti-corruption, safeguarding, security and anti-doping for the cricket governing body, will lead the oversight unit during the NPL.“We have taken previous mistakes as a lesson. The NPL will be fair,” said Lama.“Karki will oversee the integrity of the NPL. CAN has also coordinated with all the concerned departments to make sure things comply with the ICC protocol,” he added.“CAN wants to assure that the league will be without any controversy.”The NPL—which is building on the foundation laid by earlier tournaments like Everest Premier League, Dhangadhi Premier League and Pokhara Premier League—is also positioning itself as a game-changer for domestic cricket, with the promise of becoming a vital financial lifeline for domestic players.A major highlight is the league’s title sponsorship deal with Siddhartha Bank Limited, which is being hailed as the largest sponsorship agreement in Nepali sports history. However, the exact figures of the agreement have not been disclosed.Eight franchise teams—Biratnagar Kings, Chitwan Rhinos, Janakpur Bolts, Karnali Yaks, Kathmandu Gurkhas, Lumbini Lions, Pokhara Avengers and Sudurpaschim Royals—collectively spent more than Rs50 million rupees in the auction. They secured marquee players for 2 million each, while the players graded into A B and C categories were auctioned at base prices ranging from Rs20,000 to Rs1.5 million.The big investment underscores the league’s ambition to redefine the profile of cricket in Nepal and provide robust financial support to domestic players.While CAN provides monthly incentives to national players, NPL offers a new pathway for many domestic cricketers to build sustainable careers within the country. The tournament will nurture the next generation of cricketing talent by offering them a platform to showcase their skills and catch the attention of national selectors. Each franchise has identified a local iconic player through talent hunts, further strengthening the grassroots impact of the league.“The NPL will be a big support to domestic cricketers,” Lama said. “The players are very motivated by the initiative. It also lays the ground for grassroots cricket development as the teams have conducted talent hunts in the provinces they represent. And the exciting participation of hundreds of teenagers in the hunts is further evidence of the game’s popularity.”In addition to spotlighting emerging players, the NPL offers national cricketers a global stage to showcase their abilities.“The NPL provides an opportunity for national and domestic players to share the field with foreign professionals and world’s best cricketers. This will help them learn, grow, and improve as cricketers,\" said former national player Sharad Vesawkar, who will represent Chitwan Rhinos in the NPL.Vesawkar also emphasised how the league will help highlight Nepali talent to the world while providing a financial boost to local players aspiring to build careers in cricket. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nNhasala Joshi, co-founder and executive director of Women Leaders in Technology (WLiT), a non-profit that empowers young women in STEAM fields, sat down with the Post's Timila Maharjan. In this conversation, Joshi highlights the role of poetry and literature in her personal and professional growth. She is an engineer turned development practitioner, passionate about using data and technology to shape an inclusive digital future.What sparked your interest in literature?Since school, I have never been interested in reading textbooks. Instead, I was drawn to non-academic books. I still remember an activity from 8th grade in our Compulsory English workbook: I had to write a poem. My English teacher praised my poem and encouraged me to write and read more. That moment sparked my interest in poetry and creative writing.I don’t recall the first book I read, but ‘Seto Bagh’ by Diamond Shumsher Rana is one of the earliest books I enjoyed. I read its English translation back then while trying to improve my English. To this day, it remains a book I recommend to everyone.What encourages you to write poems?I started writing poems for myself. It was a personal space to process and express my thoughts and emotions. I’ve performed slam poetry several times and shared some pieces on my Instagram. In fact, my first Instagram post was a poem.When I was younger, I was influenced by the poems I read and often tried to emulate their style. Over time, I feel I have developed my voice, an accumulation of the different poetry styles I’ve encountered. At various points in my life, I was reading works by BP Koirala, Sarah Kay, and Pablo Neruda, each of whom deepened my love for poetry and shaped my perspective.Although I’ve written poems only a handful of times, I want to continue exploring this creative outlet. However, there was a period when I became overly critical of my writing, which made me hesitant to share my work. On top of that, my busy work schedule interrupted my writing. Despite these setbacks, my passion for poetry remains, and I hope to return to it more consistently.What kind of books do you read? I don’t have a specific favourite book genre—it changes frequently. Over different phases of my life, I’ve explored a variety of books. During my school days, I was drawn to historical fiction and spent some time delving into books on Hindu mythology. While I read fiction in the past, my work has recently steered me toward nonfiction and leadership-related books.Since I primarily work from home without fixed hours, my work often extends throughout the day. To maintain balance, I set aside two hours daily to read a few pages. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to keep up with that routine, though I hope to return to it soon.These days, I find myself more inclined toward short stories. They’re easy to read, and I can finish them quickly, which fits well with my schedule. During the Covid pandemic, I was part of a small book group where we read short stories and shared opinions. At a time when nothing felt certain, reading short stories became the highlight of my day.Since then, my interest in short stories has grown. If I choose to read fiction, I usually gravitate toward short stories. Even during busy times, I enjoy them because they’re quick to finish yet engaging.Have books influenced your journey so far?Every book I’ve read has influenced me in some way. While I can’t pinpoint specific books that have shaped my personal or professional journey, I believe all the books I’ve encountered have contributed to my nature, personality, understanding, and opinions. Each book leaves behind impressions, and certain parts always resonate with me, influencing me in one way or another.Poetry books have influenced my journey, often helping me navigate difficult times. Books written by women and about women’s stories have shaped my understanding of feminism, womanhood, and even my work. Reading stories of women written by women became a way to share their vulnerabilities and learn from their experiences.Books like ‘We Should All Be Feminists’ and ‘Invisible Women’ have deepened my advocacy for greater representation of women in technology. Additionally, Pablo Neruda's poetry has been a constant source of inspiration.When I was working as an engineer, the book ‘Change by Design’ influenced me.Name a few books that comforted you.Books by Sarah Kay and Sabrina Benon have helped me in my hard times. ‘Depression and Other Magic Trick’ by Sabrina Benaim comforts me. ‘Leaves of Grass’ by Walt Whitman is one of the books I keep returning to. It is a poetry collection, and one poem, ‘A Song of Myself,’ is one of my favourites from the book. It calms me when I’m anxious and reminds me to slow down and appreciate life’s moments.How has reading helped you lead your organisation?Books written by women have played a key role in my leadership journey. When I started working in gender data and with WLiT, I came across ‘Invisible Women’. This led me to explore more literature on leadership, which has been instrumental in shaping my role at WLiT.However, beyond books, I’ve found value in reading articles, blogs, and magazines like Harvard Business Review, Medium, Clark Magazine, and Granta Magazine. These resources have been helpful in session planning and developing organisational strategies. I remember searching for a book to understand organisational strategy when a friend, who was also leading a company, recommended Harvard Business Review. That recommendation shifted my focus to reviews and blogs.Do you have a favourite place to read?I love reading in the comfort of my bed, where I can have uninterrupted personal space. Public places like cafes don’t work because I need solitude to immerse myself in a book.Nhasala Joshi’s book recommendationsLeaves of GrassAuthor: Walt WhitmanPublisher: SelfYear: 1855The story encourages you to pause and reflect on why you’re always in a hurry.

However, the party leadership has failed to assign the responsibilities of departments, district in-charges, and various party bodies.Party leaders claimed that they agreed to defer the agenda for Friday citing that the party needed further discussion on the subject.“The party has almost completed the task of the work division, but we still need a little more time for the discussion,” Jagannath Khatiwada, a party leader, told the Post. “The final list of the work division will be announced on Friday.”Earlier, the leaders said that the division of work of the leaders would be proposed on Wednesday and endorsed by Thursday.Dissatisfied by the delay in assigning the responsibilities, a group of leaders even submitted a memorandum to the party office a few months earlier.Failing to resolve the issue, leaders in November formed a task force led by party chair Nepal that included senior leader Jhalanath Khanal, Beduram Bhusal, Pramesh Hamal, Ghanendra Basnet, Rajendra Pandey, and General Secretary Bhusal.Party secretary Somnath Pandey claimed that the delay was caused not due to disputes but due to festivals and other engagements.“The party has almost completed the work division task and it will accommodate all the leaders. Even some leaders who were earlier said to be dissatisfied will get important responsibilities,” Pandey said. He said preparations were in the final stage to make the responsibilities public on Friday.There was widespread dissatisfaction in the party regarding the selection of office bearers, politburo members, and central committee members.Pandey said that the party is preparing to assign responsibilities of all levels of committees on the basis of the ‘one-post, one-person’ concept, meaning that a leader will be given a role in one position to ensure that party leaders get roles in a judicious way.He added that the system would also help manage leaders at all levels and further strengthen the organisation. \nNepal’s two largest and ruling parties were busy in internal meetings in the past few days. The Nepali Congress central executive committee met on Monday, while the CPN-UML held a meeting of the party's secretariat on Tuesday.The main topic of discussion in both parties' meetings was Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s recent visit to China and the agreements reached during that visit.The two parties, meanwhile, have differences over the visit and the eventual agreements, especially the framework for the BRI cooperation. The government on Tuesday made the copy of the BRI cooperation framework public.Raghubir Mahaseth, a member of the UML secretariat and head of its foreign affairs department, said that the secretariat meeting had declared the prime minister's visit as a success. “As per last week’s deal between the two countries, projects would be implemented either through grants, loans or joint investment,” Mahaseth said. But the Congress meeting insisted that Nepal cannot and should not accept loans to fund BRI projects, according to joint secretary of the party, Jeevan Pariyar.“It has been our official stance that Nepal should not take loans to fund BRI projects. Our party understands the phrasing ‘Aid Assistance Financing’ in the BRI framework to mean that the country will take only grants,” Pariyar told the Post. Prime Minister Oli, however, has said that it can be either a loan or a grant. “BRI funding can be a loan, a grant, or joint investment,\" Oli said in Birtamod, Jhapa on Monday. “Some people are shouting without understanding what BRI actually means.” “If the BRI framework involves loans as well, why did the prime minister lie at a press conference at Kathmandu airport after returning from China, when he said there was no agreement to take loans?” questioned Congress joint general secretary Pariyar.The Congress calling for developing BRI projects under grants does not mean the party is against cooperation with China, Pariyar said.Congress former general secretary and influential leader Krishna Prasad Sitaula also says that the party’s decision on Monday on the financial modality for BRI projects is official. When asked whether the two ruling parties’ differing understandings of the funding method for BRI projects will affect government functioning, Sitaula denied such a possibility.“Even if the two parties have different views on the BRI financing modality there should be no difficulty in cooperation,” Situla told the Post. Mahaseth echoes Situala. The agreement was done in presence of leaders from both the parties so it should not attract any confusion, Mahaseth said. “For us, the only thing that matters is the opinion of the establishment wing of the Congress,” says UML publicity department chief Rajendra Gautam. Gautam says that what other Congress leaders say on the issue is not so important, given that the establishment wing of the Congress has already welcomed the agreement on BRI cooperation.“Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba himself has endorsed the agreement between Nepal and China under the framework for BRI cooperation,” Gautam said. “To manage the political camps in the party, they might be saying different things, but that does not carry any importance.”Again, there is no particular reason to oppose the agreement between the two countries since the agreement was done as per the blueprint prepared by a Congress-UML task force, Gautam stressed. Also, the agreement was inked in presence of Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba who is also a leader of Congress, Gautam said. Not only on the issue of BRI, the Congress also appears to be dissatisfied with other agreements reached during the Prime Minister Oli’s visit to China and some of the points made in the joint statement.Govindaraj Pokharel, Congress leader close to Shekhar Koirala and a former chair of the National Planning Commission, gave a few reasons suggesting that Nepal has deviated from the conventional foreign policy of the country which is non-alliance and the Panchsheel.Nepal used the Chinese name Xizang for Tibet and by agreeing to firmly support China’s effort to reunite Taiwan into mainland China, Nepal deviated from its foreign policy, Pokharel argued. Head of Foreign Affairs Department of UML, Mahaseth challenges Pokharel saying, “The agreement done during Prime Minister’s China visit aligns with the foreign policy of the country.”Nepal has been a staunch supporter of One China and the agreement has not deviated from it, Mahaseth added.“Being the signature party on the framework for the BRI cooperation under the ‘Aid Assistance Financing’, the Congress in future only can raise questions on the terms and conditions of the financial assistance, but it has to abide by the agreement. So supporting the document was a mistake by the party,” says Pokharel.The coalition government of Congress and UML has agreed to take soft loan, grant and technical assistance for the projects of Nepal’s interest under the BRI. Despite the party's official decision not to take loan, what made party members agree on the ‘Technical support and Aid Financing Modality’?” questioned Pokharel.Pokharel also hinted that the issue of agreement reached would stir up controversy in the party.  \nA year before the scheduled 15th general convention of the Nepali Congress, leaders from the party’s dissident faction have started exerting pressure on the leadership to hold the event on time.Shekhar Koirala, the Congress’s dissident faction leader, convened a gathering of chiefs of the party’s local units on December 3 in his hometown Biratnagar, demanding that the 15th general convention be held by mid-December next year.Addressing the gathering, he urged all the participants to start a pressure campaign for a timely convention from each of the local units they lead. “The longer the period the general convention is deferred, the weaker the party will become,” he said.On various occasions of late, Koirala has been consistently demanding that the party hold the convention as stipulated in the party statute.However, several party leaders the Post talked to see no chance of the party holding its national gathering on time. Congress, often dubbed the country’s grand old party, held its 14th general convention in mid-December 2021, and should hold the next convention by mid-December 2025 as per the party statute. If the party is to hold its general convention a year later, it should have started the convention-related activities by now but it hasn’t, says a leader.Krishna Paudel, the party office’s chief secretary, said Congress needs to resolve issues related to active party membership before starting the process of the convention.Of the total 165 federal electoral constituencies, the issues of active party membership have been resolved only in the Kathmandu-4 constituency, according to party leaders.“Apart from this, the Congress needs to amend its statute to address various challenges the party is facing in the changing context and for that, the party will soon form a statute amendment committee,” Paudel said. “Despite pressure from a section to hold the general convention by the end of next year, the party is unlikely to do so.”The party statute gives each elected body a four-year tenure. However, the party charter provisions a one-year extension if the general convention cannot take place within four years. Further, Nepal’s constitution also envisions that political parties hold their conventions every five years. Article 269 (4) (b) of the constitution requires a political party to hold its general convention at least once every five years. In special circumstances, the constitution allows the event to be postponed for six months citing a valid reason.Congress leadership went for maximum extension allowed by the statute before holding the last general convention. Fearing that President Sher Bahadur Deuba could repeat the same situation, the Koirala-led faction plans to compel the party establishment to adhere to the party charter’s four-year gap between the two conventions as there is no crisis barring the party from holding the event.During the Mahasamiti meeting held in February, Gagan Thapa, a general secretary of the party, presented his organisational paper and proposed concluding the conventions of lower party committees by the end of November (last month). Under the plan, conventions of the ward units should have been held by the end of November, and conventions of village and city committees should have been held by the middle of this month.Thapa at the Mahasamiti meeting had proposed concluding the party’s all district conventions by mid-September 2025, provincial conventions by mid-November, and the general convention by mid-December 2025. The Congress chooses its leadership from the ward level to the centre through the conventions. The party conducts four tiers of direct elections. And general convention delegates are elected by and from among them.The organisational paper presented by the general secretary was endorsed by the Mahasamiti meeting, provided that it could also be amended by the central committee meeting. The subsequent central committee meeting of the party held in August also passed the paper presented by Thapa.Nevertheless, none of the party’s general convention-related activities have started in the lower units as per the schedule.Mahalaxmi Upadhyaya, a joint general secretary of the Congress, says that despite the party statute mentioning holding the general convention within four years, party history suggests that it gets extended at least by one year in accordance with the party charter.Several Congress leaders said that Deuba wouldn’t convene the general convention before taking charge of the government as per his deal with the CPN-UML.As per the Congress-UML agreement reached while forming the two-party government in July, Congress President Deuba will become prime minister after two years of signing the two-party deal.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli upon his arrival from the China visit on December 5 said that he would hand over the government leadership to Deuba after 18 months. If Congress follows the party statute to hold the general convention, it should take place just after a year, but Deuba will get the reins of government only 18 months later.Citing that, many Congress leaders said that Deuba will not hold the party's general convention without first taking charge of the government.“Since Deuba already has announced he won’t be in the race for the party's top position, becoming prime minister after relinquishing the post of party president might be difficult,” said a party leader.He may feel that his prospect of becoming prime minister as per the understanding with the UML might be in risk once a new leader elected from the convention heads the party, the leaders said.In the last general convention held in 2021 when Deuba and Koirala were contesting for the post of party president after the first round remained indecisive, Deuba while seeking the vote in the runoff had requested votes from the delegates saying his position of prime minister may not continue should he not remain the party chief.So Deuba will try to take the government reins before conducting the party convention, leaders say.Upadhyaya, however, differs.“The convention may not take place next year because no substantive preparation has yet begun,” she said, “not because his premiership will be challenged for not being the party chief.” \nRastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is currently in police custody under charges of cooperative frauds, organised crime, and money laundering, has been taken to Birgunj for further investigation.Lamichhane, who was arrested on October 18 from RSP’s central office in Kathmandu, was initially taken to Kaski for questioning. On Monday, he was flown from Pokhara to Kathmandu and then to Simara and transported by road to Birgunj, where investigations into the case will continue.In addition to Lamichhane, Chhabilal Joshi, another prominent figure and former deputy inspector general of Police, who is associated with the Gorkha Media Network, was also moved to Birgunj. Joshi and Lamichhane are accused of embezzling funds from the Sanopaila Savings and Credit Cooperative in Birgunj.Both Lamichhane and Joshi had previously been remanded in police custody after Kaski District Court extended their detention on Sunday by an additional four days for further investigation. Lamichhane’s detention has been repeatedly extended since his initial arrest, with previous remands ranging from 6 to 15 days.Lamichhane and Joshi, among others, have been interrogated in Kaski, Rupandehi, Kathmandu and Chitwan as well on cooperative frauds.Various reports of studies and probes conducted by police, special parliamentary probe panel, local governments and other agencies have found the involvement of RSP chief Lamichhane, Joshi and several other individuals in embezzling deposits of cooperatives based in Kathmandu, Kaski, Rupandehi, Chitwan and Birgunj. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \n\nOn October 27, around 50 individuals of a high-profile group of American corporate CEOs flew to Everest for a sightseeing tour. Over 15 chopper flights were conducted from Lukla to 5,545 meter-high Kala Patthar. They clicked photos and selfies for a few minutes and returned to Kathmandu.The group spent nearly Rs16.20 million on chopper reservations, excluding other expenses such as hotels, transport, and national park fees, which could be worth millions of dollars.“They were high-end visitors to Nepal, who had money but no time,” said Anil Manandhar, corporate manager of Shree Airlines, Nepal’s largest helicopter operator. “As high-end tourism contributes to the long-term economic welfare of destinations, the government must know how to promote them.”But on Wednesday, chopper operators received a big jolt—beyond their imagination.From January 1, choppers will be barred from conducting sightseeing tours in the Everest region.The Sagarmatha National Park, which hosts Mt Everest, issued a circular informing all helicopter companies that they can no longer operate sightseeing flights in the national park.“We are taking this unpopular decision to provide justice to wildlife,” said Sushma Rana, senior conservation officer of the park, which has headquarters at Namche Bazaar. Helicopters have also been banned from transporting cargo above Pangboche at 3,985 metres above sea level.“The rule, however, will not apply to rescue flights,” said Rana.The park was established on July 19, 1976, and covers an area of 1,148 square kilometres in the Solukhumbu district. In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural phenomena and unique culture, the park was included on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list. “The chopper-ban is a very strange decision that will deal a huge blow to high-end tourism,” said Manandhar. Already, there are restrictions. From Kathmandu, helicopters can carry four passengers in a light and medium helicopter up to Lukla. From Lukla, the chopper can take only two passengers to Kala Patthar. Choppers are restricted from landing at the Everest base camp but can make an overfly.So, the tour operator’s itinerary usually includes the Kathmandu-Lukla-Kala Patthar flight. From there, tourists take lunch at Everest View Hotel in Syangboche and fly back.Revenue-wise, a tourist pays around Rs10,000 under different categories: Rs3,000 for park conservation, Rs2,000 for village development, and Rs900 for airport. Separately, helicopters pay Rs3,000 for each landing and parking.“The Everest sightseeing tour is Nepal’s premium product, which we have not marketed well. It can bring high-end tourists from around the world,” said Manandhar. In the peak season, there are 8-10 such flights. On Thursday, operators held an emergency meeting with the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the civil aviation regulator. The Airlines Operators’ Association of Nepal said it would only honour the regulator's decision. Issuing a press statement on Thursday evening, the association said it would not abide by the decision made by the national park as the civil aviation regulator has the sole authority to ban flights. The association, the umbrella body of the airline companies, said it would continue flights.The national park has many complaints about helicopter companies that prompted it to make such a drastic decision.Rana said they analysed three significant factors, which ultimately resulted in such an unpopular move. First, excessive noise pollution. The noise pollution in the wildlife habitat has resulted in behavioural changes in the local animals. “The sounds can cause wild animals to leave their habitat and run into the villages. Our studies show that accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising,” Rana said. The shy natural goral is found foraging and sheltering in rocky faces of mountains.“The animals jump off the cliffs in shock when choppers fly at low altitudes with big sounds. Their death cases are rising. We are doing justice to the wild animals by stopping commercial flights above the national park.”Second, according to Rana, the park has long warned helicopters to stop haphazard landings. “But no one has abided by this decision. Besides, we suspect the smuggling of wildlife contraband,” said Rana.“If helicopters ignore landing in the designated areas, we obviously cannot monitor them all. This gives us room to suspect that they are involved in smuggling.”Third, the locals say the rise in heli tours has cut their jobs. Usually, it takes 14 days for trekkers to reach Everest base camp. But most of them return by helicopter. “So chopper ride has cut jobs of porters and guides, and also affected businesses of tea houses and resorts in the Everest region,” said Rana.The park alone did not decide to ban sightseeing. Multiple stakeholders, including the local government and the local people, are involved. The Nepal Army and local youth groups have been tasked with monitoring the ban.This is not the first time the park tried to ban sightseeing flights.In October, the park office in Namche wrote to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal in Lukla, requesting a ban on helicopter flights for commercial purposes over the national park. Tour operators say that honest chopper companies have been made to suffer due to the wrongdoings of a few unethical ones that breach rules for “quick profit”. “And now authorities have imposed a blanket ban,” complained a top official of a helicopter company. In 2018, Nepal ordered a review of helicopter rescues after uncovering a multimillion-dollar scam in which climbers were pressured to take costly flights down mountains, sometimes by spiking their food. Unscrupulous operators pocketed thousands of dollars from insurance companies by making multiple claims for a single chopper ride or pushing trekkers to agree to airlifts for minor illnesses.Scammers can charge thousands of dollars for a helicopter rescue.According to Rana, the conservation officer, more than 6,000 choppers fly above the national park in the spring and autumn seasons. Rescue flights for tourists and trekkers will still be allowed. However, they, too, must secure recommendation letters from nearby health institutions, buffer zone committees, or ward offices. According to operators, rescue operations were already lengthy. “Now, the process could be impossible to complete.” These flights must be approved by the park office, and detailed records of the individuals to be rescued must be submitted. According to the new rule, the rescue chopper should be fully equipped, and the patient should be treated at Pasang Lhamu-Nicole Niquille Hospital in Lukla. \nThe 140-megawatt Tanahu hydropower project in the Tanahun district has achieved 63 percent physical progress, raising hopes of power production by its stipulated completion deadline of May 2026.Divided into three packages, the overall financial progress of the project is 58 percent.Nepal has only two storage projects—Kulekhani I (60 MW) and Kulekhani II (32 MW).The project, which will be Nepal’s third storage type, is 150 km west of Kathmandu on the Seti river near Damauli in the Tanahun district.Shyamji Bhandari, project chief, said grouting is being done in the lower level area of ​​the main dam under package 1. Grouting is one of the most popular methods for controlling water leaking in fill dam constructions.According to him, a 140-metre tall dam will be constructed on the Seti river, which flows through the border of Rishing Rural Municipality-1 and Byas Municipality-5 in Tanahun district.“We are preparing to start constructing the main dam soon,” Bhandari said.The first package—a 140-metre-tall dam and other structures—is being constructed by a joint venture of Song Da Corporation, Vietnam, and Kalika Construction Pvt Ltd. Bhandari said that the physical progress of the first package has reached 36 percent.Similarly, under package 2, work has been underway on the concrete lining, a layer of cement placed on the subbase of the 1,493-metre-long tunnel starting from the reservoir's intake and ending at the penstock pipe.Bhandari said the installation of the penstock pipe is in the final stage.\"The water from the main tunnel will be released through a 213-metre-long penstock pipe to a powerhouse, which will be underground,\" he said.The hydro-mechanical works have been contracted to Sinohydro Corporation of China.The project said the construction of the powerhouse is also in the final stage, adding that the construction of the switchyard and installation of equipment in the powerhouse are underway. The physical progress of package two is about 62 percent.KEC International Limited India is undertaking package 3, which consists of building a 220 kV double-circuit transmission line from Damauli to Bharatpur in Chitwan.According to the project, out of the 94 towers in the 34.7 km transmission line, the foundation of 78 towers has been laid, and 69 towers have been erected. The progress of this package is 74 percent.The project said the overall construction is set to be completed by May 2026.The project will be one of Nepal’s biggest storage-type projects, with an estimated annual energy generation capacity of 587.7 GWh for the first 10 years and 489.9 GWh from the 11th year. During the dry season, the project can generate energy for six hours daily.The project is being co-funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the European Investment Bank.A $150 million loan agreement was signed with the ADB on February 21, 2013. A similar loan agreement for $183 million was signed with JICA on March 13, 2013, and an agreement with the European Investment Bank on May 7, 2013, for a $70 million loan, which was later increased to $85 million.The government and the Nepal Electricity Authority will use their money to build the infrastructure during pre-construction. The project is estimated to cost $505 million, and the Nepal government will contribute $86 million.On Monday, a team consisting ADB country director for Nepal Arnaud Cauchois and Nepal Electricity Authority executive director Kulman Ghising, including the chairman of the board of directors of Tanahu Hydropower Limited, conducted on-site monitoring of the project and instructed it to complete the construction on time.Under the project's social development programme, the rural electrification and distribution system to electrify Tanahun district has been completed through the project management directorate of the Nepal Authority.Under this, two 33/11 kV substations for local electricity supply have been built and operated in Ghiring Rural Municipality-4 and Bandipur Rural Municipality-6.A 33 kV line has been constructed to supply electricity to the substations.The project said that distribution transformers of different capacities have been installed, and 11 kV lines have been constructed in various places to make the electricity supply of Tanahun district sufficient, reliable and of good quality.Under the community development programme, 63 projects, including education, health, drinking water, roads, river embankment construction, etc., have been completed in the project-affected areas. Ten projects are currently running. Various skill-based trainings are being conducted to generate livelihood and income for project-affected people.Tanahu Hydropower Limited, a subsidiary of Nepal Electricity Authority, has also advanced the development of the 126MW Lower Seti Hydropower project downstream of the Seti river.The Consultant, JV of WAPCOS Limited, India and Nippon Koei Co. Ltd, Japan, submitted the final Detailed Design Report in June 2024. \nRajkali Rawat of ward 7 of Patarasi Rural Municipality in Jumla, in mid-western Nepal, had not heard about homestays until a few years ago.Now, along with five other women, she runs a thriving community homestay. She is busy nowadays offering hospitality to her guests. Her homestay offers food made from traditional cereals like buckwheat, millet, foxtail millet, marsi rice, and beans, among other crops. Tourists are attracted to the organic dishes and traditional culture offered in homestays.“I used to think operating a homestay would be a lot of hassle. But I was wrong,” said Rawat. “It has become a good source of income.”In a homestay, tourists live in people's homes, share meals, and experience local life and culture. Living in a Nepali village as a homestay guest is perhaps one of the fastest and best ways to get to know the real Nepal. Daily cultural activities are a major attraction of the homestay scheme. The women of Patmara opened their community homestay four years ago, and since then the model has spread to other areas. Locals said the homestay greatly promotes traditional dishes, preserves local culture, and observes natural beauty.Patmara village is a gateway to the popular Rara Lake. Trekkers visiting Rara Lake often go to Patmara. After opening the community homestay, the model has also been replicated in other areas.According to operators, a homestay normally earns Rs300,000 to Rs400,000 a year.Rawat said that since homestays are new to Jumla, they usually hold monthly meetings to discuss improvements in hospitality. Facilities and services are reviewed, and they address complaints made by tourists to improve the experience.The community homestay in Patmara started four years ago, and the community has held more than 100 meetings. Before operating the homestay, the women visited Pokhara and Ghale Gaun, a popular scenic tourist destination in Lamjung, where homestays are popular.Kalashi Budha, secretary of the community homestay, said many homestays focus on decoration. “But here, natural beauty is enough to attract tourists.”During the monsoon, tourists can enjoy the green highland pastures. In winter, they are mesmerised when they see the pasture covered in snow. “The view and traditional food make tourists happy,” said Budha.Initially, the women took out loans of Rs 100,000 to start the homestay, and now they invest from their earnings. Women are also financially independent and support others by providing loans at low interest rates.Rawat said women used to ask for money in their homes to run the family, but now they take care of their children's and husbands' expenses.Rawat's husband, Nara Bahadur, has been in Saudi Arabia for the last two years. Before that he worked for five years in Malaysia. His income has also been invested in homestay.Alcohol is prohibited in the homestay.The homestay offers buckwheat, wheat, and barley dishes, including bread, cake, lentils, beans, and marsi rice. Tourist favourites are chicken, marsi rice, and potato dishes.Food is prepared according to the tourists' preferences. Tourists also admire boiled local potatoes and local potato chips.Other villages have also started operating homestays and welcoming guests.According to Budha, more than 1,000 tourists from Australia, the US, France, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan have stayed in the Patmara homestay. Women have kept a list of tourists.“With the arrival of tourists after homestays were opened, sanitation in the villages has improved,” said Budha.“Most of the tourists arrive by making phone contact, while some arrive after visiting Rara Lake,” said Budha.Women operating homestays also have other roles. Once a month, they monitor the community forest to control illegal wildlife and herb trade. They are particularly concerned about the conservation of red pandas as most tourists come to see these shy animals.Conservation efforts are underway to save red pandas, and Maharudra Community Forest has been designated as a pocket area for their protection.The Red Panda Network, Kathmandu, and Hatemalo Nepal have been helping to manage and operate homestays.Hoarding boards have been placed in community homestays to promote the red panda.Patmara is located just beyond Urthuchautara, on the way from Khalanga. Tourists use the shortest route to reach Rara Lake, so 10-25 vehicles arrive daily. In 2011, the government announced the Nepal Tourism Year, which set off the homestay trend in the country in anticipation of a surge in tourist arrivals.Homestay was conceived as an alternative arrangement for an expected hotel room shortage during the tourism campaign, which aimed to attract one million tourists.Homestays then became a permanent feature of Nepali tourism. Hundreds of homestays started to pop up across the country. The government gave homestays legal status by drafting a regulation. Homestays became a success.However, many individuals and community homestays folded due to the Covid pandemic.The history of homestays in Nepal dates back to 1980, when the late Captain Rudra Man Gurung opened the first homestay in Nepal, Sirubari Homestay Retreat, which was a new kind of hospitality service in the country.Located in a hill village in Syangja southwest of Pokhara, the homestay started by the former Indian Army officer put Sirubari on Nepal's tourism map, and it became a popular village tourism destination. \nThe Health Foundation Nepal (HFN), a non-profit established in 2013 by Nepali doctors in the United States, hosted its 12th annual conference on December 7 in Greensboro, North Carolina.Committed to improving healthcare for underserved communities in Nepal, HFN has been instrumental in addressing disparities in community and mental health and combating non-communicable diseases through its programmes in the Dang and Chitwan districts.One of its notable initiatives, Khushi Ba Ama, provides comprehensive support to senior citizens over 60, addressing both their healthcare and social needs.During the Annual Scientific Meeting, Dr. Shreedhar Paudel, HFN’s chairperson, underscored the organisation's achievements and outlined plans to expand collaborations with the Nepali government and other stakeholders to enhance healthcare initiatives.The conference also featured discussions on global and mental health advancements, with presentations covering topics such as cultural competence in mental health care and the prevalence of depression among Nepali medical students, reflecting HFN’s decade-long impact. \nNepal has banned additional three hazardous pesticides—paraquat dichloride, chlorpyrifos and phorate—which are not only being used to kill pests but are also being misused for suicide.“The Pesticide Management Committee has decided to prohibit the production, synthesis, export, import, transport, commercial use, storage, and sale of the said pesticides in the country,” reads the order published in the Nepal Gazette on Thursday.Poison ingestion, mostly involving pesticides, is the second leading cause of suicide in Nepal after hanging. According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 952 people killed themselves by consuming poison in the fiscal year 2023-24. “Poison is easily available in every household in rural areas across the country, as farmers often keep it in the house to use in crops,” said Dr Dilli Ram Sharma, former director general at the Department of Agriculture. “These hazardous substances are easily available in agri-veterinary shops and are not only being used in plants but also for suicide in our country.”Earlier, in 2018, the country banned eight pesticides—carbofuran, dichlorvos, triazophos, carbaryl, benomyl, carbosulfan, dicofol, and aluminum phosphide. Following the ban, suicides by poison ingestion have dramatically declined, according to Nepal Police report.Police data show that 1,320 people died by poison ingestion in 2018-19, the year authorities banned eight pesticides commonly used for suicide. The numbers dropped to 1,136 in 2019-20; 1,276 in 2020-21; 1040 in 2021-22 and 932 in 2022-23. Sharma said that traders can sell their existing stock of banned poisonous substances for up to two years, but cannot import more.“These pesticides are so hazardous that they can cause cancer, paralysis, renal failure, heart diseases in children, and deformities in newborn babies if used for a long time,” said Sharma. “Many countries, including India, have banned these pesticides.”After the ban on aluminium phosphide in 2018, people in crisis began ingesting chlorpyrifos, which is widely available on the market. Studies show that banning highly hazardous pesticides is a cost-effective and affordable intervention to reduce suicide rates. Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates. The country witnessed an alarming rise in suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year. “Restricting access to commonly used hazardous pesticides will help reduce deaths from suicides,” said Dr Rakesh Ghimire, principal investigator of Nepal for the Center for Pesticide Suicide Prevention at the University of Edinburgh of the United Kingdom, which has been carrying out research on suicides by poison ingestion in Nepal. “Many people who are in a moment of crisis can change their minds if they do not have access to poisonous substances.”Studies show that a ban on a few highly hazardous pesticides in Bangladesh, South Korea, and Sri Lanka, among others, led to sharp reductions in overall suicide rates. Pesticides are commonly used to get rid of insects, fungi, weeds and diseases which damage plants and crops. Every year more than 1,300 metric tons of 135 types of pesticides, including insecticide, fungicide, herbicide and biopesticide, are brought into Nepal, according to the Plant Protection Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.Doctors say high levels of pesticides in fruits and vegetables cause nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dizziness and anxiety. Long-term consumption of fruits and vegetables with high levels of pesticides can lead to kidney failure, lung disease and mental health problems, and can even cause cancer. According to health experts, the consumption of such fruits and vegetables may also affect pregnant women and harm the foetus. \nNearly 30 percent of doctors who completed their master’s degree and sat a recent licensing test of the Nepal Medical Council failed to score the pass mark.According to the council, the national regulatory body of medical doctors, only 175 out of 275 doctors who appeared for the exam passed the licensing test held on Thursday.“Only those who secure the pass mark become specialist doctors,” said Dr Chop Lal Bhusal, chairman of the council. “Those who fail the licensing test have to retake the exam.”The council conducts the licensing test for postgraduate doctors every four months. Those who fail can retake the exam until they pass.This is not the first time such a large number of doctors have failed to secure the minimum pass mark needed to practise as consultant doctors. Officials at the council said the average pass percentage for postgraduate doctors is around 70.“Only 50 to 55 percent of doctors with an MBBS degree pass the licensing test, while around 70 percent of postgraduate doctors pass,” said Bhusal. “What is worrying is a lot of doctors with master’s degrees are failing to secure even the pass marks.”To qualify as a medical practitioner, a doctor must secure at least 50 percent in the licensing exam. Experts say the quality of medical education is being compromised by underachievers who do not deserve to practise medicine entering the profession. “Universities and colleges must pay closer attention to the results of the doctors they produce,” said Bhusal. Licensing tests for medical doctors are a routine procedure in every country. Nepal’s licensing test focuses only on doctors’ knowledge. Some countries also conduct skill tests. Council officials said they had also planned to conduct skill tests in the past, but could not due to the lack of skill labs.“Only the National Academy of Medical Sciences;, Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine; and Kathmandu University’s Dhulikhel Hospital have skill labs,” said Dr Krishna Prasad Adhikari, former registrar of the Council. “We had planned to set up skill labs with support from various agencies, including the World Health Organisation, but things didn’t go as planned.”The World Health Organisation said inaccurate diagnosis, medical errors, inappropriate or unnecessary treatment, inadequate or unsafe clinical facilities and practices, and healthcare providers who lack adequate training and expertise are present in all countries. The UN health body says low-quality health care is increasing the burden of illness and health costs globally. \nThe Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, which has been running a human milk bank, is now providing breast milk to vulnerable infants born in other hospitals.Doctors at the hospital said the purpose of the milk bank is to save infants' lives, regardless of where they are born.“Human breast milk is required for vulnerable infants—those whose mothers died during or after giving birth, critically ill newborns in neonatal intensive care units, premature babies with low birth weights,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, director at the hospital. “We have been supplying breast milk to such infants in other hospitals, including Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Patan Hospital, Norvic Hospital, and B&B Hospital, among others.”The human milk bank, launched some two years ago at the hospital, aims to reduce neonatal deaths, which remains constantly high. Since 2016, neonatal deaths have not declined, despite various measures implemented by health authorities.According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births.Doctors say feeding low-weight babies and critically ill neonates in intensive care units can significantly reduce the risk of infections. The bank collects, tests, pasteurises and stores donor milk from lactating mothers.“The milk is collected mostly from the mothers of ailing babies, who cannot breastfeed their infants admitted to the intensive care units,” said Dr Sailendra Bir Karmacharya, a senior consultant paediatrician of the hospital. “We provide milk only to infants weighing less than 1,000 grams.”According to doctors, human breast milk contains the best source of nutrition and ensures the survival and healthy growth of babies. It bolsters brain development and has lifelong benefits for both the baby and the mother.Karmacharya said that human milk helps in reducing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal problem that mostly affects premature babies. Officials said the hospital needs 1.5 to 2.5 litres of breast milk for babies admitted to the intensive care unit. The human milk bank collects milk directly from mothers of hospitalised babies, but it collects only surplus milk from other lactating mothers, which is then tested, pasteurised and stored at minus 40 degrees Celsius. The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. The 16th five-year periodic plan, which ends in 2029, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from 21 per 1,000 live births. The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes, including hiring staff nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding has the potential to prevent 13 percent of under-five deaths. Studies show that Nepal's exclusive breastfeeding rate has steadily declined over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022, exclusive breastfeeding dropped consistently from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It stated that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), compared to 12 percent of those born at home.Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is prone to contamination and increases the risk of diseases in children, according to the World Health Organisation.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to breastfeed their babies, as studies show. The report shows that the proportion of children who are bottle-fed increases with mothers’ education, rising from 12 percent among children of mothers with no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Bottle-feeding is most common in the highest wealth quintile—46 percent—and least common in the lowest wealth quintile—11 percent.Among the seven provinces of Nepal, exclusive breastfeeding rates are the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest at 11 percent in Karnali Province, 12 percent in Madhesh Province and the highest at 43 percent in Bagmati Province.Doctors recommend breastfeeding for the first two years of a baby’s life or longer, as breast milk lowers the risk of illness in children, promotes their recovery during illness, and provides important nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nEminent city doctors and health experts today gave a call for caution, mass awareness and improved government policies to minimise the use of microplastics that can cause several health hazards, including cancer.Tiny plastic particles that are less than 5 mm are called microplastics and are being attributed to severe respiratory diseases or even some types of cancer. According to Dr Monidipa Mondal, an eminent radiation oncologist, when microplastics enter the body through food or other sources, they first encounter the immune cells. “Being micro-mini in size, they can easily enter the immune cells after which a biochemical agent called cyclophane is released. The cyclophanes prepare chronic information inside the cells. “As we know if chronic information continues to get stored in the cells, it can lead to cancer. Apart from this, cancer is also related to free radicals. Therefore, it also creates oxidative stress in the cells and free radicals in the cells due to which cell multiplication occurs,” informed the doctor.As reiterated by Dr Mondal, recent studies have revealed an increased number of colorectal cancers among people. “It has been found in some studies that microplastics could be a possible driver of colorectal cancer. Another observation reveals a link between breast cancer and microplastic. We have also heard about BPA-free plastic. BPA or Bisphenol-A is an agent that can mimic estrogen. In some cancer cases, estrogen has been found. It can, therefore, be said that if it can mimic estrogen, it could also be a possible cause of breast cancer,” she added.According to research by India Clean Air Network (India CAN), degraded plastic from waste and wastewater discharge due to inefficient treatment processes are two of the major sources of microplastics in West Bengal entering the human body in various ways. The health experts recommended stronger and improved government policies to curb the menace of plastic. As pointed out by Professor Sadhan K Ghosh, mass awareness, particularly among young students is the need of the hour. “The first need is waste segregation. Second, the governance should be such that microplastics are not created for which legislation and its implementation must be done. Also, as plastic becomes brittle and enters our body while swimming or is even consumed by fish that we eat, littering sea beaches should be prohibited,” pointed out the professor.-In Association with ANN \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nKarnali Yaks registered a five-run win against Lumbini Lions in the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL) at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Friday.Batting first, Karnali set the target of 129 runs. Karnali’s Will Bosisto contributed the most runs 45 off 30 balls, Arjun Bitalu chipped in with 25 runs, opener Babar Hayat made 20 runs while Chadwick Walton made 15 runs. Lions bowler Vikash Agri took the major 3 wickets and Tilak Bhandari took two wickets, while Ramon Simmonds, Saad Zafar and Rohit Paudel took up one piece. Chasing a target of 129 runs, Lumbini managed to gather 123 runs at the loss of 7 wickets in 20 overs. Tom Moores and Sundeep Jora with a partnership of 51 runs raised the run score, but the Lions were not able to chase down the target. Lions’ batters were bowled out with Ashutosh Ghiraiya at 16 runs off 21 balls, Arjun Saud (13), Rohit Paudel (10), Ben Cutting (1), Tilak Bhandari (3*), Ramon Simmonds (4*). Saad Zafar was run out at 16.Yaks’ Zeeshan Maqsood took two wickets. Sompal Kami, Nandan Yadav, Bipin Sharma and Will Bosisto took a single wicket each.  \nAs Donald Trump steps up his tariff threats against China, Beijing is moving to beat the next US president to the punch with its own restrictions and get Washington to the negotiating table ahead of a full-blown trade war, analysts say.Armed with the lessons of the last trade war during Trump’s first term, China is seeking to amass bargaining chips to kick off talks with a new US administration on contentious aspects of bilateral ties, including trade and investment, and science and technology. It is also concerned about the harmful effects of additional tariffs on its already fragile economy.This week, China launched a probe into US chip giant Nvidia (NVDA.O) over what it claimed were suspected antitrust violations, which follows its ban on US-bound exports of rare minerals.“We have to look at this as the opening bid in what will likely ultimately turn into a negotiation with the US rather than just an imposition of tariffs and everyone walks away,” HSBC’s Chief Asia Economist Fred Neumann said.China is better prepared to deal with almost any tariffs, short of an “Armageddon announcement” of a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, said George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre.The world’s second-largest economy now globally dominates sectors such as electric vehicles and green energy, and has less need for the Boeing jets and large gasoline-fuelled cars it bought back in 2017, having found substitutes such as Airbus airplanes and its own Comac C919.But China is far from self-sufficient.A new trade war with the world’s biggest economy would still hurt China more, analysts say, as Washington can levy ever-larger import duties on its goods and further rip China from its supply chains.China still needs to import strategic materials from the US such as advanced microchips and other high-tech equipment and counts on US consumers to buy its goods, given an increasingly pessimistic global trade outlook and weak domestic consumer demand.Beijing wants to sit down with Trump before he places more curbs on US high-tech exports and to secure the renewal of the US-China Science and Technology Agreement, said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific at Natixis.The agreement, which enables scientific collaboration between the two countries, lapsed in August and negotiations over its renewal are unlikely to be completed before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.While China’s Huawei (HWT.UL) has heavily invested in its advanced chip-making capabilities, their commercial viability remains unclear, she added, incentivising China’s negotiators to sit down with their US counterparts to strike a deal ensuring a steady supply of American-made chips.Art of the dealBeijing took two years before it agreed to buy an extra $200 billion in American goods and services, per the terms of the “Phase One” agreement which ended the first trade war.This time, China has new carrots to dangle, such as increasing purchases of oil and liquefied natural gas, as the US is currently pumping out more than it can consume.“Trump bragged on the campaign trail: ‘Drill baby, drill,’ so (he) will need the demand support,” said Bo Zhengyuan, a Shanghai-based partner at consultancy Plenum.Given the increasing restrictions on the export of chips, agricultural goods, commodities and energy are among the items the US can still sell to China, Bo said.China’s commerce ministry said it was open to engaging and communicating with the economic and trade teams of the Trump administration, when asked for comment.But Beijing also has sticks to beat Washington with, if the US side feels China’s failure to meet its previous purchase commitments means it will gain more from tariffs than talks.US firms are already feeling the squeeze, said Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.“US companies and other foreign companies have really been concerned about whether they actually have access to this market,” Hart said. “Can we even sell into China anymore? Is there an outright ban on us?”Business sentiment among US firms in China is at its lowest since 1999, according to a September survey by the American Chamber’s Shanghai chapter.There are also non-economic factors at play. Trump has pledged additional tariffs of 10% on Chinese goods to push Beijing to do more to stop fentanyl flows into the US“Using political justifications for the imposition of trade restrictions ultimately makes the tensions much more intractable,” said HSBC’s Neumann.The fentanyl tariffs also mirror China’s import curbs on trading partners that displease Beijing over issues such as human rights, Taiwan and the South China Sea.“It’s taking a leaf out of China’s manual of coercion,” Magnus said. “I think they would see it as a slap in the face.” \nAn Israeli strike killed at least 30 Palestinians and wounded 50 others who were sheltering in a post office in central Gaza Strip, bringing the death toll on Thursday in the enclave to 66.With no sign of let-up in the 14-month-old conflict, the strike hit a postal facility in Nuseirat camp where displaced families had sought refuge and also damaged several nearby houses, medics told Reuters.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Nuseirat is one of the Gaza Strip’s eight historic camps originally for Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war around the establishment of Israel. Today, it is part of a dense urban area crowded with displaced people from throughout the enclave.Earlier on Thursday, two Israeli strikes in southern Gaza killed 13 Palestinians who Gaza medics and Hamas said were part of a force protecting humanitarian aid trucks. Israel’s military said they were Hamas militants trying to hijack the shipment.Many of those killed in the attacks on Rafah and Khan Younis had links to Hamas, according to sources close to the group.The Israeli military said in a statement the two airstrikes aimed to ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and accused Hamas members of planning to prevent the aid from reaching Gaza civilians who need it.The statement said the Hamas members aimed to hijack the aid “in support of continuing terrorist activity”.Armed gangs have repeatedly hijacked aid trucks, and Hamas has formed a task force to confront them. The Hamas-led forces have killed over two dozen members of the gangs in recent months, Hamas sources and medics said.Hamas said Israeli military strikes have killed at least 700 police tasked with securing aid trucks in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. It has accused Israel of trying to protect looting and “creating anarchy and chaos to prevent aid from reaching the people of Gaza”.Separately, the Israeli military on Thursday ordered residents of several districts in the heart of Gaza City to evacuate, saying it would respond to rockets launched from those areas.“This is a pre-warning before an attack,” read a military statement posted on X that some residents also received as text and audio alerts on their mobile phones.The evacuation orders caused a new wave of displacement. At nightfall, dozens of families streamed out of the areas heading toward the centre of the city.ISRAELI STRIKES IN GAZA CITY, CENTRAL GAZAIsraeli bombings of a residential building in Gaza City’s al-Jalaa Street and a house west of Nuseirat killed 22 people, medics and the Palestinian news agency WAFA said.In the northern Gaza refugee camp of Jabalia, where the army has operated since October, health officials said an orthopaedic doctor, Saeed Judeh, was shot dead by Israeli forces while on his way to Al-Awda Hospital where he usually treated patients.The health ministry said his death raised to 1,057 the number of healthcare workers killed since the war began.Months of ceasefire efforts by Arab mediators, Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, have failed to conclude a deal between the two warring sides.On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to demand an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire and the immediate release of all hostages seized in Israel in October 2023 and held by Hamas in Gaza.The war in the Palestinian enclave began after Hamas gunmen stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to Hamas-run Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.Since then, Israel’s military has levelled swathes of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 44,800 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. \nOutgoing US President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was pardoning 39 people convicted of non-violent crimes and commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 others who were serving long prison terms.The moves come over a week after the president signed an unconditional pardon for his son Hunter.Officials said last week that the White House was listening to demands for Biden to extend the same grace to thousands of people wronged by the US judicial system.Biden said the people he granted clemency would have received shorter sentences if charged under today’s laws, policies and practices.Sources had told Reuters last week that the pardons being discussed included those convicted of nonviolent drug offenses and people identified by civil rights groups as unjustly incarcerated.“As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses,” Biden said.The president added that he will take more steps in the weeks ahead and that his administration will continue reviewing clemency petitions.The commutations announced were for those who were placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate the spread of the virus, experts say, rather than many individuals civil rights groups have been advocating for.“We want Biden to look at those people and consider using his power even more in the upcoming weeks,” said Tierra Bradford, senior program manager at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.US Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, one of the leading Democrats behind a letter to Biden last month urging him to issue clemency to Americans with nonviolent offenses, commended the president for taking “meaningful and historic action.”Her statement noted that he could take further steps to exercise his power during his remaining 39 days in office.The White House said the clemencies granted by Biden were the most ever in a single day.“The president takes this very, very seriously, and is going to review all options, especially ... the clemency petitions,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on January 20, has said he would act on his first day in office to pardon rioters involved in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, further building expectations for a broad granting of clemency. \nA Pakistani court indicted imprisoned former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife on fresh charges of illegally selling state gifts on Thursday, local broadcaster Geo reported.The indictment was the latest in dozens of cases against the 72-year-old former cricket star, who has been in jail since late last year.Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have already been granted bail in the case, which is one of a series of state treasury charges known as “Toshakhana”.These charges revolve around allegations that Khan and his wife illegally procured and then sold gifts worth more than 140 million rupees ($501,000) in state possession, which he received during his 2018-22 premiership. They have denied committing an offence.Khan and Bibi were both handed a 14-year sentence on those charges days before a national election earlier this year, following a three-year sentence handed to him in late 2023 in another version of the same case.However, their sentences have been suspended in appeals at the high court.The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes - the most expensive being valued at 85 million rupees ($305,000).Earlier this month, Khan was also indicted on charges of inciting attacks against the military, a case stemming from deadly anti-government rallies led by his party last year.Bibi also led a deadly protest march by thousands of supporters in the capital Islamabad on Nov. 25, escalating a face-off with the government and its military backers.Khan has been fighting court cases since he was ousted from power in 2022. He and his party say the cases were made up to keep him out of politics at the behest of the military after he had fallen out with the army's generals. The army denies the accusation. \nKite-flying, a cultural tradition in Kathmandu Valley, began with the arrival of Newar traders carrying the skill from Tibet or China. During Dashain, kites soared and fought in the skies, with spectators cheering and children collecting fallen ones. Kite fighters used special threads to cut opponents' lines, creating a sharp \"chaitt\" sound. The season officially ended with a fair at Budhanilakantha Temple, where King Tribhuvan sometimes participated in kite competitions. However, urbanization and modern entertainment have led to the decline of kite-flying in Kathmandu.\nFrom 2008 to 2017, Matina Shakya served as the Kumari of Kathmandu, venerated as a divine goddess in Hindu-Buddhist tradition, while her reign ended with menstruation, paving the way for Trishna Shakya's succession.\nJuddha Shumsher Rana's Jawalakhel Zoological Garden featured exotic animals like tigers, rhinos, leopards, elephants, deer, birds, and even a lion, with the zoo officially opening to the public in 1956 after becoming a government property in 1951.\nMSMEs, employing 85% of Nepal's workforce, face a $3.56 billion financing gap due to inadequate banking structures. The Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) aims to bridge this gap by mitigating risk, enabling access to credit, and supporting growth sectors.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) chatbots provide companionship and therapeutic support, addressing loneliness and mental health challenges, but raise concerns about data manipulation, potential misinformation, and reduced human interaction.\nNepal's planning and budgeting adhere to constitutional provisions, empowering federal, provincial and local governments to operate within their jurisdictions, estimated resources form the basis for MTEF and annual budgets, with the National Planning Commission playing a crucial role; however, challenges include oversight, compliance, allocation misalignments and fiscal dependency of subnational governments.\nStudents in quake-damaged schools in Karnali endure dangerous conditions a year after the earthquake, despite recent reconstruction initiatives.\nIn August this year, the three major parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—joined hands to pass the long-stuck bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act-2014. Their action was widely hailed as a big milestone in Nepal’s transitional justice process. But now, when time has come to pick the candidates for the two important transitional justice bodies—the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP)—which have been without office-bearers since 2022, the parties are faltering. The names shortlisted as potential office-bearers of these commissions have sparked controversy, with conflict victims accusing the parties of overlooking their concerns.These commissions’ role in concluding Nepal’s peace process is pivotal. The CIEDP was formed to find the whereabouts of the disappeared persons, recommend reparation to victims and prosecute the accused related to the armed conflict. Similarly, the TRC is there to investigate serious human rights violations, identify those involved and recommend reparative and legal measures. It also envisioned reconciliation, mutual goodwill and peace between perpetrators and victims. Yet, they have fallen woefully short of the expectations of both victims and rights activists. Due to a lack of competence and constant political meddling, they haven’t progressed beyond collecting complaints and conducting initial investigations in a handful of cases. This is the third time the government is appointing officials to these commissions. Still, past mistakes in the selection of office-bearers are being repeated, as a recommendation committee has been formed under the leadership of a person who botched the same job in 2020. The chairpersons and members of the two commissions nominated under him had failed to perform their duties. The names shortlisted this time have also disappointed rights activists and victims alike. Despite their repeated calls to select the commissions’ leaderships through a consultative, transparent and inclusive process, their concerns went unheeded. The list, in the eyes of rights activists and victims, prioritises controversial figures over competent and deserving ones. This leaves one wondering if the parties had a hidden agenda behind the August agreement, as it seems partisan interests have again prevailed over national healing. The politicisation and manipulation of these commissions’ selection processes will not ensure justice for the victims of the insurgency. When the parties united to conclude the process back in August, the international community had immediately welcomed the move, but the new controversy over the shortlisted names again risks discrediting the whole process, both at home and abroad. What’s more concerning is that the National Human Rights Commission, which should have acted as a watchdog in the process, is silent, perhaps because one NHRC commissioner is a member of the recommendation panel. The rights watchdog’s complicity will further erode its public trust. Justice delayed has already become justice denied for many conflict victims. For the transitional justice process to come to a successful end, top political leaders and parties must rise above petty interests and acknowledge long-term damage their misjudgement can inflict on the conflict victims who have now waited for justice for nearly two decades since the guns fell silent in 2006. If these commissions again fail in their responsibilities, it will be seen as a sign of the failure of the democratic process in the country. Nepal needs competent people in the two commissions, those with unwavering integrity and commitment to justice. We have ample evidence now that compromised transitional justice bodies cannot work in the interest of victims.   \nProvincial assembly parliamentary committees are pivotal to strengthening federalism in Nepal. These committees work to hold provincial governments accountable. Even when the assembly is not in session, the committees can continue working. As the provincial assemblies cannot manage all the tasks, these committees, with various thematic jurisdiction and expertise, work by often rising above partisan interest to save the parliament’s time; they simplify work and conduct various studies. Article 193 of the Constitution of Nepal specifies that “the State Assembly may, as per its rules, form committees or special committees, as required, to manage its working procedures”. Thus, the number of thematic areas varies in each province. However, the functioning of these committees is undermined in several provinces. In Karnali, three of the four parliamentary committees—the Finance and Natural Resources Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Social Development Committee—are currently without heads. While the first committee has had no chief since April this year, the latter two have been vacant for three months. The prolonged leadership vacuum in important committees is also something that is routinely seen in other provinces. The five committees in Bagmati were at a standstill without chairpersons for more than a year since the first session of the start of the second term of the Bagmati Provincial Assembly in January 2023. The parliamentary committees in Lumbini and Sudurpaschim have been without their chairs after the formation of their respective assemblies last year. The absence of chiefs of these key provincial assembly parliamentary committees makes it difficult to hold the provincial governments accountable. These governments fail on governance, budget implementation and role assignment to the provincial assemblies. Passage of essential bills is also hampered. Four critical bills are stuck in various committees in Karnali. Meetings to facilitate dialogue between assembly members and ministers are yet to be convened. Moreover, the provincial government, taking advantage of the committee’s ineffectiveness and lack of monitoring, has been working arbitrarily, bypassing essential checks and balances.This in turn has added to the woes of Karnali, a geographically remote and severely underdeveloped region in western Nepal. The inactivity of the Social Development Committee is particularly concerning in a province where basic social indicators, such as health and literacy, lag far behind the national average. As the committee also deals with ministries of land management, agriculture and cooperatives, labour and social justice and human rights commission, works related to these areas are also affected. Despite the province’s rich natural resources, their potential remains untapped. Lack of development activities, particularly road-related infrastructure, has affected the province’s tourism prospects. The inactivity of the Finance and Natural Resources Committee is, therefore, troubling. More worryingly, another leaderless committee—Public Accounts—which oversees the financial discipline of the province, could fail to monitor corruption activities.Provincial governments were envisioned as significant drivers of localised development and accountability, but they have often become battlegrounds for political manoeuvring. Because of this, appointments for the leadership positions in these committees, as has happened in Bagmati in the past, have been deliberately delayed by the political parties. Even though Karnali’s assembly regulations allow the eldest member of the assembly committee to act as an interim chief, this provision has not been invoked. The political parties would do well to appoint the chairs immediately to stop the erosion of public trust in provincial governments—unless that is precisely their intent.    \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nOn Friday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy to mainly fair throughout the country.Tonight the weather will remain partly cloudy to mainly fair throughout the country.On Thursday Janakpur experienced a maximum temperature of 27.6°C, while Jumla registered a minimum temperature of -6.2°C.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has concluded that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit was a failure as he could do nothing other than sign the agreement that was readied by the erstwhile government led by party chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal.Addressing the party’s standing committee meeting on Friday, Dahal said that the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation signed during Oli’s visit is nothing new. It was planned during his prime ministership and Oli just formalised it through the agreement.“The framework is a cut and paste of the document finalised during my prime ministership,” Ganesh Shah, the party’s secretary, quoted Dahal as saying at the meeting. “Oli couldn’t make any breakthrough during the China visit.”No party leaders questioned Dahal’s statement.The leader of the opposition had made a similar claim while addressing the party’s mass meeting in his hometown of Chitwan on Tuesday. He had claimed that Oli had been circulating the photocopies of the agreement signed during Dahal’s China visit. Dahal last visited China in September last year. After multiple rounds of negotiations, Nepal and China on December 4 signed the 10-point framework for BRI cooperation, opening doors for Chinese funds for developing projects under the BRI. The funding modalities, however, will be negotiated for each project individually. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already made public the agreement undersigned by acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.Neither Dahal nor other party leaders, however, were critical of the agreement. There was a common opinion that the signing of the framework could open the doors for the country’s development, according to leaders present at the meeting.The standing committee meeting called to finalise the agenda for the party's central committee meet slated to kick off on Tuesday ended up postponing the meet.“The central committee meeting has been deferred till January 5, 2025 due to lack of preparation,” said the party’s spokesperson Agni Sapkota. “A standing committee meeting will be held for three days starting January 2 to finalise the agenda for the central committee meeting.”The Maoist Centre is negotiating with some parties including the one led by Netra Bikram Chand for a possible merger. Dahal believes there will be some concrete progress in the merger by January 5. “In the central committee meeting, the chairman was to give a message that the party is consolidating its strength by uniting with Chand and others,” said a leader. There is a possibility that former vice-president Nanda Bahadur Pun will be given some party role—possibly vice-chair—at the upcoming central committee meeting. Pun, who has started attending the Maoist Centre’s office-bearer meetings, however, was absent from the Friday meeting.Talking to media after the meeting, Sapkota said the outcome of the recent local level bypolls has foiled the attempts of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to lead the country towards a two-party system. The Maoist Centre had won 11 out of 42 seats where the by-elections were held. Elated by the results, Dahal is preparing to present it as an indication of his party gaining ground and erosion of people’s trust towards the Congress and the UML, during the party’s central committee meeting. “The by-election results also indicate people’s increasing dissatisfaction and anger at the Congress-UML government,” said Sapkota, while making the meeting’s decisions public.In the meeting, the party leadership also decided to intervene in the leadership selection in its wing All Nepal National Independent Student Union (Revolutionary). Concluding that the union failed to hold its general convention, the party decided to pick the leadership while also imposing an age bar for student politics. After several postponements, the national jamboree of the union started in September. However, it was suspended without electing the leadership following a dispute over the selection of convention representatives and whether or not to set an age bar for the leadership. The convention that was scheduled to kick off on December 8 was postponed by the Maoist Centre’s standing committee meeting on December 5. “The party will intervene and select a new leadership in the student wing. An age bar—possibly of 30 years—will also be enforced,” a party leader told the Post. For years, the Maoist Centre’s leadership has directly picked leaders of its student wing. A group of student leaders led by vice-chair Keshab Rawal has been opposing the party’s regular interference in the union, saying, “It (the party leadership) thinks the students are its slaves and abide by whatever decision it makes.” Rawal, who had once staged a hunger strike demanding union’s general convention, has threatened a fresh protest against the party’s decision. A section of the student leaders claim Dahal is reluctant about holding the general convention fearing that his favourite candidate may lose. \nThe dispute between the Sagarmatha National Park, home to Mount Everest, and the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal over restricting helicopter sightseeing tours of the world’s tallest peak has intensified.A day after the park authorities issued directives restricting choppers from flying over the national park during Everest sightseeing tours starting January 1, the aviation regulator on Friday said the park has no legal ground to enforce such a ban.The regulator has asked the helicopter companies to continue the flights unless it decides otherwise.The dispute highlights the larger tension between Nepal’s high-end tourism and conservation in one of the world's most iconic natural regions. “We are making this unpopular decision to give justice to wildlife,” Sushma Rana, senior conservation officer of the park, which has headquarters at Namche Bazar, told the Post on Thursday. Helicopters have also been banned from transporting cargo above Pangboche at 3,985 metres above sea level.“The rule, however, will not apply to rescue flights,” said Rana.The park was established on July 19, 1976, and covers an area of 1,148 square kilometres in the Solukhumbu district. In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural treasures and unique culture, the park was put on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.Experts call the chopper ban hasty, reached without extensive consultations. They warn that it could harm Nepal’s tourism, which is still struggling to recover to pre-Covid levels. The park is also a major tourist attraction, especially for those trekking to the Everest base camp.Nearly 50,000 trekkers and mountaineers visited the national park in the last fiscal year. According to park officials, low-flying choppers cause noise pollution in wildlife habitats, which has affected animal behaviour.The most immediate concern raised by the Sagarmatha National Park is the severe noise pollution caused by frequent helicopter flights over the area. The noise disturbs animals, which rely on the park’s relatively undisturbed natural environment. Excessive noise can interfere with their feeding, breeding, and other behaviours.“The sounds can drive wild animals out of their habitats and into villages. Our studies show that accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising,” Rana said.The shy natural goral, which forages and shelters on rocky faces of mountains, has been particularly affected.“The animals jump off the cliffs in panic when choppers with loud noise fly at low altitudes. Their deaths are rising. We are doing justice to the wildlife by stopping commercial flights over the national park.”According to Rana, the park has long warned helicopters to stop haphazard landings.She said that there are over 6,000 chopper flights over the national park in the six months—spring and autumn—Nepal’s peak tourism season. Helicopter operators say the national park’s decision may severely impact high-end tourism.The Airlines Operators Association of Nepal issued a statement on Thursday criticising the decision. The civil aviation body, tour operators, and helicopter companies argue that helicopter flights are vital to the tourism industry, especially for high-end tourists who prefer a quick aerial view of the Everest region or need helicopter services for transport and rescues. Experts say there is a need to strike a balance between tourism and conservation.“National parks are an important part of our heritage, and their preservation is crucial,” said Deepak Raj Joshi, CEO of Nepal Tourism Board, the national tourism promotional body. “But the hasty decision by the Sagarmatha National Park to ban Everest sightseeing flights is nonsense. There has been no extensive discussion on this critical issue, and the ban can dent the country’s image.”He added that as tour operators make bookings in advance, such abrupt decisions will send a negative message. “Many people who have money but little time want to visit this iconic place. So we need to explore alternatives to resolve this issue.” Some experts suggest that designated flight corridors should be established to avoid key wildlife habitats.Mountaineering expert Ang Tshering Sherpa, a former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, said a tussle between two government agencies—the civil aviation body and Sagarmatha National Park—would not help improve Nepal’s tourism.“National parks are a key source of Nepal’s tourism income, and conservation should be a top priority. But the park should not impose restrictions whenever and wherever it likes as helicopters have invested billions and promote Nepal’s high-end tourism.”He said the helicopters are there for sightseeing tours, rescue and cargo transport in rugged terrain. “To strike a balance, there is a need to establish flight corridors in order to minimise noise in key wildlife habitats.” \nIn October, 27-year-old Mandeep Gurung from Dhulikhel thought he had found a respite from his struggles. Gurung (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) came to Kathmandu from Jhapa in January 2024 with the hope of a better income. But he faced months of difficulty finding a job.With the pressure of supporting his family and rent mounting, he was drawn to a sponsored Facebook post offering lucrative earnings for simple online tasks. “Earn up to Rs60,000 per month working from your phone,” the ad read.For Gurung, the promise of earning Rs60,000 a month by performing simple online tasks seemed too good to pass up.The Facebook ad led him to a Telegram group, where Gurung was welcomed by a ‘coordinator’ (fraudster posing as a Daraz subsidiary company’s coordinator) who explained the process. Tasks seemed simple enough: liking websites, subscribing to YouTube channels, and sharing promotional links. To start, however, Gurung had to deposit Rs5,000 as a ‘membership fee’.“At first, I was hesitant,” Gurung said, “but I thought, why not take a chance? They even paid me Rs1,000 after my first task, which made it seem legitimate.”Encouraged by the coordinator’s continuous lies that he would be paid double when completing higher tasks, Gurung deposited more money over the next month.In total, he invested Rs25,000—the amount he had saved for rent. The cycle abruptly ended when the coordinator asked him to recruit five new participants. Gurung was then blocked from the Telegram group.“I now feel ashamed,” Gurung said. “I trusted them because they paid me initially, but it was just a trap. My savings are gone… I don’t know what to do.”Gurung’s experience is far from unique. Employment fraud in Nepal is increasing, according to Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson and information officer for the Cyber Bureau.“These scams exploit trust and desperation. Victims are lured into schemes via platforms like Telegram, where fraudsters provide instructions for tasks that initially seem credible but eventually turn exploitative,” said Awasthi.Data from Nepal’s Cyber Bureau reveals a surge in cybercrimes, particularly electronic transaction frauds, over the past few years.In the fiscal year 2022-23, a total of 9,013 cybercrime cases were reported, with 1,835 related to electronic transaction fraud. By the following year, the number of cybercrime cases increased to 19,730 with electronic transaction fraud comprising 20.84 percent (4,112 cases) of the total, according to the bureau.This upward trend continues into the current fiscal year (2024-25), with 3,257 electronic transaction fraud cases already registered. Among these, the highest number of cases (1,186) fall under the category of ‘online job/loan’ or ‘employment fraud’ scams.The second most reported type involves ‘online shopping/online marketplace’ scams, with 1,027 cases. Additionally, 26 cases have been filed under ‘lure of foreign employment’, where victims were deceived online with false promises of overseas jobs.Aside from employment fraud, cyber scams range from e-commerce cheatings (where consumers pay but never receive goods), to phishing (impersonation of officials from some established companies like Daraz and eSewa), and even fraudulent flat rental listings.According to Awasthi, the total value of electronic transaction scams this fiscal year has reached Rs450 million. Even the report from the Financial Intelligence Unit-Nepal, ‘Cyber-Enabled Frauds under Strategic Analysis Report, 2024’ by Nepal Rastra Bank, indicated a sharp rise in fraud-related suspicious transactions in the first five months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.Fraudsters often use ads on social media platforms to lure victims into Telegram groups, according to Awasthi. There, victims like Gurung are assigned tasks that initially appear legitimate. To maintain credibility, scammers deposit small amounts of money into victims’ accounts for completed tasks.“It’s a calculated strategy,” Awasthi says. “Once trust is established, the fraudsters demand additional deposits under the guise of unlocking higher earnings. Eventually, the scammers disappear.”In some cases, victims are tricked into sharing their bank details with fake job listers or are tasked with making transactions between accounts as part of their ‘job’. These seemingly harmless tasks place the victims at the heart of illegal schemes, as the transactions occur under their names and accounts.In some instances, fraudsters entice victims with promises of small payments—like a monthly salary or a 2 percent commission—just to facilitate transactions through their bank or eSewa accounts.“Many victims are unaware that they are being drawn into fraudulent activities, and their accounts become conduits for illegal transactions,” said SP Awasthi. “When investigations unfold, these individuals find themselves already trapped in trouble, while the scammers disappear.”The Cyber Bureau understands the victims’ plight and does not penalise them, but Awasthi said that the growing volume of these cases is making it increasingly difficult to manage the situation. According to the bureau, Telegram is the primary platform used for electronic transaction fraud and scams. Investigating these cases proves challenging, as Telegram does not provide the necessary data to the Cyber Bureau.“Our only option is to trace the flow of money through bank records,” Awasthi said. “Often, when we contact the numbers traced from the bank, the calls go unanswered, or the numbers are no longer in use. It’s more complicated when the fraudsters operate from outside Nepal.”The digital landscape is expanding faster than public awareness of cybersecurity. For instance, according to a report by Nepal Rastra Bank, 70 percent of the individuals implicated in cyber-enabled fraud cases are aged between 19 and 30.These days several banks through their websites have been cautioning that it’s against the law to lend your account for others’ use or unauthorised purposes. Yet, people often fall into these traps. “While 4G has reached remote areas, awareness of internet risks hasn’t”, says Awasthi. He believes that technology should follow awareness, not the other way round. People are getting access to technology without understanding digital security, which is leading to an increase in cybercrimes and frauds. “The Cyber Bureau’s major role is to investigate crimes. While raising awareness is our concern too, we cannot do it all with limited resources… The government must seriously work to form a separate team or body to improve public awareness of these issues at the grassroots level”, adds Awasthi. \n‘Intermezzo’ is the fourth novel by Irish writer Sally Rooney. It is about the complicated lives of two brothers as they grieve the loss of their father from cancer. The story is based in Dublin and revolves around 32-year-old Peter Koubek and 22-year-old Ivan Koubek. Their parents live separately. The boys’ mother, Christine, lives with her boyfriend and children. Peter is a lawyer, whereas Ivan is a chess genius.These two brothers have a distant relationship, which further strains after their father’s death. Struggling to connect, they seek solace in romantic relationships. In the novel, we can see Ivan saying they were close when he was small. However, after he turns 16 and Peter breaks up with his high school girlfriend, Sylvia, he changes, and they grow apart. Ivan wishes for them to get back together as he thinks Sylvia has a good influence on him.Peter distracts himself with work, drugs, alcohol, and caring for two women: Sylvia, his high school girlfriend (now ex) and Naomi, a 23-year-old university student whom he is seeing at present. He had a great relationship with Sylvia, which took a turn after her accident and left her in chronic pain. For Peter’s sake, she broke up with him six years ago. But Peter isn’t over her. As he mourns his father, he also grieves for the life he and Sylvia could have had together, unable to give up their lost future. Sexual desire pushes Peter toward Naomi, who used to earn by selling her photos online. Their relationship is transactional and physical. The two women are aware of each other and have come to terms with it. Although Sylvia, now a professor of modern literature, and Peter are no longer together, they often share lunch and walk in familiar places. Peter, however, tries to keep his relationship with Naomi a secret. Sylvia is portrayed as Peter’s soulmate, someone he is comfortable and happy with, but their complicated relationship can’t work. On the other hand, while Peter cares for his girlfriend Naomi, he struggles to accept her publicly and feels guilt for being with her, as he is still not over Sylvia. Rooney also explores Peter’s mental turmoil, depicting his suicidal thoughts and reliance on drugs to sleep and escape from his real-life issues.Ivan, on the other hand, is shy and socially awkward. Once a chess prodigy who dominated major tournaments, he grapples with a career decline. He feels his career peaked during his teenage years, leaving him with little to look forward to. Despite holding a degree in theoretical physics, Ivan struggles financially, living in a shared apartment. He scrapes by with freelance data analysis work, which he detests, and spends his weekends participating in chess competitions and workshops.At a chess exhibition several hours outside Dublin, where Ivan impressively defeats ten opponents simultaneously, he meets Margaret, the event's programme director. Margaret, 14 years his senior and recently divorced from her alcoholic husband, captivates him. Their connection is born out of mutual loneliness, a rare moment where both feel seen. Despite their growing bond, the pair begin seeing each other secretly, as Margaret fears judgment from her family and friends regarding their significant age difference.At Sylvia's request, Peter invites Ivan to dinner, attempting to mend their strained relationship. During the meal, Peter tries to initiate conversations, but the evening turns tense when Ivan shares details about his new relationship with Margaret. Peter disapproves, questioning if Margaret is “normal” for dating someone so much younger and unemployed. His comments reveal his hypocrisy, as he is in a relationship with the much younger Naomi. Deeply offended, Ivan lashes out and storms out of the restaurant, shouting that he has hated Peter his entire life.As this is the first novel I’ve read by Rooney, I found her depiction of the complicated relationships between the characters compelling. The vulnerability and depth of emotions she portrays in the male characters were especially intriguing, leaving me curious about how relationships and male characters are explored in her other works.Rooney’s Irish references reveal her writing is deeply rooted in her country and culture. This book, however, demands a certain emotional readiness from its readers. It takes you through a journey of grief, pain, trauma, and tangled relationships, prompting deep reflections on life and personal connections. Yet, amidst this exploration of life’s darker moments, the book carries a message of resilience. It teaches us to embrace loss and pain, reminding us that life feels richest when we stop shielding ourselves from its realities. As she beautifully writes, “Everything exposed to light and air. Nothing protected, nothing left to be protected anymore.”The characters pose a question long after the final page: “What can life be made to accommodate, what can one life hold inside itself without breaking?” Rooney’s answer is both profound and hopeful—life, she suggests, is surprisingly vast. Like this novel, it can hold an incredible range of experiences—grief, joy, and everything.Rooney’s work consistently highlights that connections with friends, lovers, and even fleeting acquaintances are key to a meaningful life. We discover meaning through conversations, shared moments, and the stubborn pursuit of love. It’s not easy, and the characters often take unconventional paths to get there. But that’s what makes this story so relatable: the struggle, the search, and the eventual revelation that fulfilment, though elusive, is always worth chasing.Thus, ‘Intermezzo’ is a powerful exploration of love and loss. Although the first few chapters may feel confusing and lacking narrative flow, the book is worth reading. By the end, it’s not so much the plot that lingers in your mind but the characters’ emotional journey.IntermezzoAuthor: Sally RooneyYear: 2024Publisher: Faber & FaberPages: 454 \nKarnali Yaks strengthened their chances of reaching the playoff stage of the Nepal Premier League T20 cricket tournament after they defeated already-eliminated Lumbini Lions by five runs in a thrilling match at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Friday.Defending a modest 129-run target, Karnali’s disciplined bowling unit restricted Lumbini to 123-7 in the allotted 20 overs.Lumbini were looking to wrap up their campaign with a consolation win but they kept losing wickets at regular intervals, with Tom Moores’ 36 run off 35 providing the highest score of the innings.Zeeshan Maqsood spearheaded Karnali’s bowling attack with figures of 2-12 in his tight three-over spell including the wickets of skipper Rohit Paudel (10 off 8) and opener Ashutosh Ghiraiya (16 off 21).Arjun Saud (13 off 6) was the first to depart, caught by Gulsan Jha off Sompal Kami’s delivery.Lumbini were reeling at 40-3 but Moores and Sundeep Jora (24 off 21) staged a brief recovery with a 51-run stand for the fourth wicket.However, William Bosisto’s breakthrough wicket of Jora in the 13.5 overs started Lumbini’s downfall as Ben Cutting (1) and Moores were sent packing in quick succession.Saad Bin Zafar’s late cameo of 16 off 11 provided Lumbini some hopes but his run out in the 18.1 over sealed Lumbini’s fate.Earlier, invited to bat first, Karnali’s innings struggled to gain momentum, slipping to 47-4 after 10.1 overs with Dev Khanal (3), Babar Hayat (20 off 22), Gulsan Jha (8) and Chadwick Walton (13 off 15) all failing to make significant impact.Bosisto and Arjun Gharti shared a 72-run stand for the fifth wicket to steady the ship.Gharti (25 off 25) departed in the 18.5 overs after Simmonds caught and bowled him, and Bosisto (44 off 33) soon followed, trapped lbw by Bikash Aagri. Kami added a brisk 3-ball 7 to lead Karnali to 128-8.A fourth straight victory propelled Karnali to third spot, putting them firmly in contention for playoffs with eight points and one match remaining.Leaders Janakpur Bolts, on ten points, have already qualified with a match to spare.Biratnagar see off ChitwanBiratnagar Kings also kept alive their slim chances of progressing into the playoffs with a 51-run victory over Chitwan Rhinos, courtesy of an unbeaten half-century from Basir Ahamad.Biratnagar opted to bat first but got off to a disastrous start, losing Lokesh Bam (0), Dipak Bohara (4), Scott Edwaruds (0) in the space of ten balls, with Dhakal striking twice in the first over.Nicholas then departed adding just eight runs that saw Biratnagar reduced to 33-4.But Ahamad orchestrated a remarkable recovery smashing an unbeaten 68 off 44 balls and sharing a 65-run partnership with opener Martin Guptill (45 off 35) and an unbeaten 83-run stand with Rajesh Pulami (33 not out off 20) to guide Biratnagar to a commanding total of 181-5.Chitwan began their chase on a poor note with Hassan Eisakhil falling for 5. Santosh Karki (28 off 25) and Ravi Bopara (20 off 24) added 46 runs for the second wicket to revive the innings But wickets continued to tumble regularly.Sandeep Lamichhane struck twice to remove Karki and Basil Ahamad (1) and Subash Bhandari removed Bopara to keep Chitwan under pressure at 64-4.Amar Routela and Kushal Malla then led another resurgence with a 41-run stand but Chris Sole broke their stand in the 16.5 overs sending back Malla (25 off 25).Routela kept fighting with a valiant 42 off 29 but his effort proved insufficient as Chitwan could only manage 130-6.Biratngar now sit in fifth position with four points from six matches, two points behind Chitwan who dropped to fourth. \nThe three-day Nanhai Buddhism Shenzhen Roundtable kicked off in Kathmandu on Friday as over 220 Chinese Buddhist monks also arrived in Lumbini, the Buddha’s birthplace, on the same day.“Warmly welcome over 220 Chinese Buddists and practitioners arriving on a international chartered flight to Gautam Buddha International Airport in Lumbini,” Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song wrote on the social media platform X. The ambassador claimed this to be the largest ever passenger arrivals from the north at the airport which was built by Chinese contractors and funded by the Asian Development Bank.“Kicking start a new round of Buddhist cultural exchanges between Nepal and China,” wrote envoy Chen. It was keenly watched whether the China-backed Panchen Lama, whose name is Gyaincain Norbu, would make a surprise landing in Lumbini to attend a special Puja scheduled for Saturday. “But he did not arrive,” Lharkyal Lama, vice-chairman of the Lumbini Development Trust, told the Post. Other monks who arrived on Friday from Beijing will participate in a special Puja on Saturday evening on the Maya Devi temple premises. Beijing has projected Panchen Lama as the successor to Dalai Lama, a characterisation rejected by Western countries as well as Tibetans refugees in exile. Earlier too, both Lamas were trying to visit Nepal but successive governments didn’t permit them to come to Nepal and Lumbini. Earlier, Lama was reportedly preparing to use a chartered flight from Beijing to Kathmandu to attend the special function scheduled to be organised on Saturday in Lumbini. When the information of his possible arrival was leaked, the government, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote a diplomatic note to the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu to make sure that the Panchen Lama is not coming. The government also made it clear that due to the sensitivity attached to his visit, it cannot permit him to visit Nepal. The Chinese Embassy responded to the foreign ministry that “it is also sensitive towards Nepal’s concerns” so there was no plan to bring him to Nepal.The government faced a lot of external and internal pressure against hosting Lama as it goes against Nepal's stated policy of ‘non-alignment’ and “maintaining religious neutrality and respecting all religions and sects”. Rigorous checks were conducted on every passenger of the chartered flight because the Lama might hold various names and identities and possess multiple passports. The Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation gave the approval to organise the religious functions in Lumbini and in Kathmandu under the banner of Nanhai Buddhism Round Table-2024.On Friday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli inaugurated the Nanhai Buddhism Shenzhen Roundtable in Kathmandu. “We do not know why the prime minister addressed such an event that does not hold much significance,” a senior official at the prime minister’s office said.“I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Secretariat of the Nanhai Buddhism Shenzhen Roundtable for organising this remarkable forum and for inviting me to share my reflections,” said the prime minister. “The culmination of eight successful episodes of the Nanhai Buddhism Roundtable speaks to the enduring dedication of this platform towards safeguarding peace, fostering cultural exchanges, and nurturing the symphony of civilisations. “Today, as the ninth chapter unfolds here in Kathmandu, I am confident that it will deepen the bonds of friendship, inspire mutual learning, and advocate the eternal values of peace, compassion, and cooperation among Buddhist communities in Nepal, China, and beyond.This gathering holds particular significance as it takes place in Nepal, the sacred birthplace of Gautam Buddha, said the prime minister. “This land, blessed by his footsteps, symbolises a timeless bridge between the Buddhist heritage of Nepal and China, reflecting a profound spiritual and cultural connection that has flourished through centuries,” said Oli.Oli also talked about Nepal-China relations in his address saying that the countries share more than just borders as the neighbours are bound by the timeless tapestry of history, the majestic embrace of mountains, the life-giving flow of rivers, and the profound richness of cultures. Buddhism has been the luminous thread that weaves together the spiritual and cultural fabric of the two nations, fostering an enduring bond of harmony and understanding, said the prime minister. “From the ancient journeys of the Chinese monks Fa Xian and Xuan Zang to Nepal, to the enlightening visit of Nepali scholar Buddhabhadra to China, our shared history is replete with exchanges of wisdom and learning,” he added. The architectural marvels of Nepali-style Buddhist temples in China and the grandeur of the Zhong Hua Chinese Buddhist Monastery in Lumbini stand as eternal monuments to this enduring connection, said Oli.“It fills my heart with pride to acknowledge the role of Lumbini Buddhist University in Nepal, a beacon of knowledge dedicated to Buddhist studies. The collaborative engagements between this institution and the Nanhai Buddhist Academy in China exemplify the spirit of partnership and shared aspiration.In his address to the monks from China, Thailand and Cambodia, the prime minister expressed his confidence that these bonds will grow stronger in the days to come, enriching the legacy of our shared heritage. \nNepal’s contradictory energy policies expose the hollow rhetoric of our top political leaders. KP Sharma Oli, the current Prime Minister and chair of the CPN-UML, retracted the proposal to transport liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs) from India to Chitwan during his previous premiership in 2020, claiming that the country is working to increase hydropower capacity as an alternative to cooking gases. Yet, the same party’s Minister for Industry, Damodar Bhandari, recently visited New Delhi to discuss a gas pipeline project. Although Nepal initially requested the LPG pipeline project (from Motihari in India to Sarlahi in Nepal) to be built with a grant from its southern neighbour, insiders are sceptical that such an ambitious undertaking can be hard without a long-term agreement. Such actions show that we as a country are nowhere close to prioritising green energy. On paper, Nepal plans to produce more than 28,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 as part of its green, renewable energy ambition. But, in practice, it is desperately lobbying for a multi-million dollar cross-border LPG pipeline project with India, supporting a continued reliance on imported fossil fuels. What our policymakers seem to be ignoring are the risks fossil fuels pose to the environment and the setbacks they cause to the overall development of hydropower in the country. Evidently, reducing the reliance on LPGs would save the country more than Rs50 billion—which was spent on importing cooking gas in the last fiscal year—which in turn would also make a big dent in the country’s ever-rising trade deficit. Moreover, compared to the LPG, electricity-powered stoves are more sustainable, environmentally friendly and cost-effective. But rather than cut their supply and imports in the country, policymakers are looking for ways to make them easily and widely available. The pouring of billions into the gas project will make the path for the establishment of additional hydropower projects in the country more difficult. Despite having the potential to produce 40,000 megawatts, the country currently generates just around 3,000 megawatts. So experts warn that the hydropower potential is at risk of being undermined by the government’s investment in fossil fuel infrastructure. At present, 44.3 percent of households in the country rely on LPG for cooking, and only 0.5 percent use electricity for the purpose, despite a surplus of hydroelectricity even during off-peak seasons. The government will require $25 billion to meet its target of replacing 25 percent of LPGs with electric stoves by 2030. Nepal is also looking to install 500,000 improved cooking stoves with a focus on rural areas. These green goals, unfortunately, are bound to get sidelined due to the LPG pipeline project. It is not that the electric cooking vision doesn’t have challenges. There are issues of frequent power cuts and low voltages. Similarly, even though Nepal’s national grid has expanded to almost 95 percent of the country’s households, five percent are still left in the lurch. This again highlights the need to ensure uninterrupted electricity for all. It is high time the government gave up the temptation of short-term LPG gains and aligned its strategies with the vision of making electric stoves one of the primary cooking methods by 2030. The country’s energy security and environment are not the things that the government can take lightly.  \nIn the era of artificial intelligence (AI), media professionals often encounter questions about the importance of journalism. With AI algorithms increasingly dictating content and influencing societal perspectives, misinformation and disinformation have become rampant. The monetisation of many social media platforms has led to the production and circulation of viral content, regardless of their credibility and accuracy. So, professional journalism’s need to act as a firewall against fake news, deepfakes, context-free information and other forms of misleading content has become more crucial. Journalism is one of the most essential professions for maintaining public trust, particularly in developing nations like ours with low media and information and communication technology (ICT) literacy. The foundational principles of journalism—truth, transparency, accountability, information verification and ethical reporting—must be the guiding tenets for an informed society in the age of AI.Misinformation in the digital landscapeSeveral social media platforms, including Facebook, YouTube and X, have been criticised for their role in rapidly disseminating misinformation, disinformation and propaganda, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, misinformation on pandemic prevention methods, such as the unfounded claim that turmeric water could cure the virus, spread rapidly in Nepal and beyond. On April 26, Sidhakura.com, a Nepali news portal, published fabricated audio entitled “The Dark Files”, raising considerable concern among stakeholders on the potential misuse of AI technology. These digital platforms use algorithms that optimise user engagement, often prioritising sensational and polarising content over factual accuracy. Concurrently, generative AI’s advent has disrupted media practices and altered journalistic gatekeeping processes.Generative AI has become one of the most deceptive threats to journalism since we wholeheartedly accept its outputs. This is called technological somnambulism, a philosophical concept that illustrates our tendency to be unaware of how technology is changing the conditions of human existence. These fake, hyper-realistic audiovisuals have been exploited to manipulate public opinion, tarnish reputations and interfere with electoral processes. In March 2022, shortly after the Russia-Ukraine war began, Russian agents produced a deepfake video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, allegedly ordering his troops to surrender to the Russian army. In June, the White House administration reported that President Joe Biden had fallen victim to a deepfake video. Biden admitted in a press conference that he could not recognise a deepfake video of his own at first glance. These instances highlight how the rapidly advancing AI-powered tools undermine the public’s hard-won trust in established media and journalistic practices. Without journalistic intervention, these manipulative tools could mislead substantial segments of the population. Investigating and verifying such claims remains vital in combating the infodemic propagated on digital platforms. So, AI tools cannot supplant the need for professional journalism in any society. Journalism over AI-generated contentIn several workshops focused on the impact of AI on journalism, in which I participated, many journalists reported utilising several AI tools, including ChatGPT, Midjourney and Google Gemini, for content creation, restructuring and copy-editing of news reports. However, they seldom disclosed their use of AI in news production. While the automation of content generation enhances efficiency, it fails to uphold transparency, contextual understanding and ethics. Further, it can create echo chambers and reinforce existing biases. For example, algorithmic biases in search engines, as highlighted by Johanna Burai’s “The World White Web” campaign against the prevailing whiteness of the Internet, along with Latanya Sweeney’s research on discriminatory advertisement delivery based on racial names, underscore the dangers of perpetuating stereotypical perceptions.In contrast to AI tools, human reporters can investigate complex societal issues, comprehend cultural sensitivities and contextualise stories in ways that algorithms cannot. According to a 2024 study by Pew Research Centre, a US-based think-tank organisation, majority of Americans still trust professional journalists more than AI-generated content. In 2023, after introducing AI news anchors on Indian television, local audiences were asked about their perceptions of automated news content and AI-powered news anchors. Many of the respondents expressed their frustrations over the mechanical news anchoring. Moreover, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation, stated that professional journalism has become essential, as it has played a fundamental role in dispelling myths and clarifying scientific information about the pandemic.Journalism's relevanceOne of the most critical functions of journalists is acting as watchdogs for those in power. AI tools or social media platforms cannot replace this as they are not designed for it. For example, investigative journalism—whether uncovering the US Watergate scandal in 1972 or exposing the fake Bhutanese refugee scam involving the government agencies of Nepal—demands the professionalism and expertise of human journalists. Originality cannot be replicated by algorithms prioritising engagement metrics, financial gains, or serving political agendas over societal well-being. Journalism should be responsible for scrutinising these systems, exposing their biases, and advocating for ethical technological development. As AI-powered tools can provide substantial assistance in data analysis, fact-checking and audience engagement, they must act as complementary tools in journalism. This will allow journalists to dedicate more time to in-depth storytelling and investigative reporting. News organisations must innovate with AI tools while upholding their commitment to the public good. When employed responsibly, AI has the potential to enhance sustainable journalism, helping it thrive in an increasingly complex media landscape.  \nDonald Trump’s victory in November’s US presidential election saw the US dollar strengthen. It surged to a one-year high within two weeks, and has since retained its strength against its major peers. His election has also again brought the prospect of US tariffs on imports, and attention has focused on the disruption to global trade that these may bring.As part of this, Trump made a not-so-veiled threat of steep levies on the Brics group of leading emerging markets should they create a rival to the US dollar, which has been the world’s “dominant currency” since the second world war.The use and holding of the US dollar by other countries is known as dollarisation. It has different levels of meaning, from countries like Panama using the US dollar as their currency, to its use in the pricing of major internationally traded commodities, and as a reserve and vehicle currency. This latter role enhances global trade.Take Chile and Malaysia as an example. Any trade between these two countries will involve the exchange of Chilean pesos for Malaysian ringgit, for which there is not a large and active market. So, pesos are instead exchanged for US dollars and US dollars for ringgit, allowing trade to occur in a quicker and more cost-efficient manner.Indeed, the US dollar is used in more than 50 percent of foreign trade invoices, and over 80 percent of all foreign exchange transactions worldwide. However, it is possible that Trump’s “America First” foreign policy could serve to hasten the end of the US dollar’s dominance.Pros and consDollarisation is beneficial for global trade. But it brings particular benefits to the US, as other countries need to hold US dollars to facilitate trade and pay for many commodities. This means that demand for the US dollar remains high, so it does not come under pressure to depreciate.A more important point is perhaps that when countries buy US dollars, they don’t hold them in cash. Rather, they buy US Treasury bills and so, in effect, lend money to the US government. This high demand for US Treasuries means the US government is able borrow at a cheaper rate than would otherwise be possible.However, there are also drawbacks. A strong US dollar increases the price of dollar-denominated commodities and thus the cost of international trade. And for the US itself, a strong US dollar can damage its domestic export business.These drawbacks have often led to the suggestion of a multi-currency global system, although this has never gained traction or been a serious consideration. But that could change with a second Trump presidency.During his first term, such calls grew louder. And there have been some shifts in US dollar holdings since then, to the extent that global US dollar reserves have declined.So, which Trump policies could hasten the end of US dollar dominance? The incoming president is regarded as pro-business, which will probably translate into policies aimed at lowering regulation and taxes. Stimulating domestic growth will lead to an even stronger US dollar at a time when global output is more modest.A stronger US dollar, as mentioned above, also increases the price of oil and similar commodities. Countries will inevitably ask themselves why oil from Saudi Arabia, for example, should be paid for in US dollars as those dollars become more expensive.Trump’s economic policies are likely to increase US debt, and this can reduce the value of the large US dollar reserves held around the world. According to one study, Trump’s plans could add as much as US$15 trillion (£11.7 trillion) to the nation’s debt over a decade. A fall in the value of US dollar reserves may result in some countries being less willing to hold US debt.The effect of these policies might be considered unintentional. But other policies, such as Trump’s plan for higher tariffs, are more deliberately designed.A strong US dollar damages US exports, as they become relatively expensive in local currency terms, and makes imports relatively cheap. Tariffs are a way to protect domestic producers from this international competition.However, assuming no other country retaliates, raising tariffs will serve only to further strengthen the US dollar, as fewer imports will mean less US dollars being sold in the foreign exchange market. This will, at least in part, undo the effect of the tariff policy while imposing trade costs globally.To avoid elements of this, countries could agree to use alternatives as a reserve currency and a means to pay for international commodities. The BRICS nations have mooted a separate currency, which could revolve around one or more existing currencies like the Euro or Yuan. Trump’s threats may simply speed up this search for an alternative.What would this mean for the US?Countries would then need to hold less US dollars, so would sell off their US Treasuries. The result will be a rise in the cost of debt for the US, and a fall in the value of the US dollar. Ironically, this would increase the price of imports (the goal of Trump’s tariff policy), but it could also lead to inflation.In a worst-case scenario, should countries coordinate their selling of US dollars and Treasuries, a run on the US dollar would have major implications for the US and the world. This would lead to higher debt costs in the US and a need to reduce its trade deficit.Globally, it would disrupt trade, raise transaction costs, and there would be a loss of value for any dollar-denominated assets and reserves. This would most likely culminate in a significant global recession.The US dollar will remain a global currency for the foreseeable future. But Trump’s “America First” policy, as well as the greater weaponisation of the US dollar, could lead to its relegation from being the only world currency.-The ConversationRead the full article here. \nA section of the Nepali Congress leaders and cadres has stepped up pressure on party leadership to hold the 15th general convention in December next year, in line with the provisions of the party statute. As the party establishment is yet to start the process of holding conventions of local chapters in the lead up to the main event next year, members from the rival faction have, in the past couple of weeks, intensified their campaign. This is the right thing to do in order to keep the party on the right track and add dynamism to the organisation. Timely conventions are vital for the health of party organizations and to rejuvenate cadres. Party members—old and new—want a predictable system of holding general convention and electing leaders, from the grassroots to the centre, through healthy competition.A general convention may seem a purely internal matter of the concerned party. But it’s an issue of public concern as well. In a republican system, political parties lead the government. From lawmakers to ministers, chief ministers to prime ministers, all come from political parties. Politicians also choose everyone from heads of constitutional bodies to the heads of state. So the importance of who leads the political parties and how they are elected goes beyond the immediate party circles. This is especially true of the leaders of the big parties like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML. Strengthening intra-party democracy is the only way to ensure that wrong people don’t make it to the parties’ leadership. Timely election of leaders, from the local to the central level, makes a political party stronger and by extension strengthens democracy. If history is any guide, the political parties that have cultivated strong intra-party democracy have succeeded in national politics as well.The Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, has of late adopted some progressive practices. For instance, earlier, the party president had the authority to pick one of the two general secretaries and a vice-president. The party chiefs would invariably handpick their loyalists. But starting the last general election, the country’s grand-old-party started electing both the general secretaries and all vice-presidents through direct voting of convention delegates. That helped two relatively young leaders—Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma—become party general secretaries. This development had greatly boosted confidence among the party’s youths. In sum, these progressive practices added vigour to the Congress. But the party has consistently failed to hold its conventions on time. The party charter has a provision that allows the office-bearers to serve for an additional year if the organisation faces an unforeseen crisis. But the Congress leadership has embraced this term extension as a normal thing, rather than see it as an exception. So it is only right that this time there is pressure on the party establishment to follow the charter and bring the derailed system back on track. As Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba is not running for the party’s executive role again, he would perhaps want to bow out as the president who did his bit to strengthen internal democracy and hand over the party’s reins to a competent successor.  \nIn a must-win match of the Nepal Premier League (NPL), Pokhara Avengers set a target of 139 runs for Kathmandu Gurkhas at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Thursday.Winning the toss, Kathmandu chose to field first, restricting Pokhara to 138 runs for the loss of 8 wickets in the allotted 20 overs. Middle-order batter Raymon Reifer remained unbeaten with 41 runs off 30 balls, hitting one four and three sixes. Opener Dinesh Kharel scored 38 runs off 25 balls, including six fours and a six, before being trapped lbw by Rashid Khan.Dilip Nath added 27 runs but was bowled by Rashid. Other batters failed to reach double figures, with Andries Gous and Narayan Joshi dismissed for ducks. Captain Kushal Bhurtel managed only 7 runs, while Michael Leask contributed 1 before falling lbw to Karan KC.For Kathmandu, Rashid Khan and Karan KC led the bowling attack, each taking three wickets. Gerhard Erasmus and Michael Levitt claimed a wicket apiece.The match is critical for both teams as they vie for a spot in the playoffs. \nA defiant South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol faces a second impeachment vote on Saturday over his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, a move that shocked the country, split his party and imperilled his presidency half way through his term.His move to impose military rule on Dec. 3 was rescinded barely six hours later after parliament defied troops and police to vote against the decree, but it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and triggered widespread calls for him to step down for breaking the law.Opposition parties plan to hold an impeachment vote at 4 p.m. (0700 GMT) on Saturday, with large demonstrations planned ahead of the vote.Yoon’s conservative People Power Party boycotted the first impeachment vote a week earlier, preventing a quorum.Since then, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon has urged party members to vote for impeachment on Saturday, and at least seven PPP members have said they would vote to impeach.The opposition parties control 192 of the 300 seats in the single-chamber parliament so they need at least eight PPP votes to reach the two-thirds threshold for impeachment.Ahn Cheol-soo, a PPP lawmaker among those backing Yoon’s impeachment, said in a Facebook post on Saturday that he would vote for impeachment “for the sake of swift stabilization of people’s livelihood, economy and diplomacy.”The PPP floor leader said on Friday, however, that the party’s stance is still to oppose impeachment.PPP lawmakers are due to meet on Saturday morning to decide whether to change that position.If impeached, Yoon would lose authority but remain in office until the Constitutional Court either removes or reinstates him. In the meantime, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would serve as acting president.If the court removes Yoon or he resigns, a presidential election must be held within 60 days.Yoon is separately under criminal investigation for alleged insurrection over the martial law declaration and authorities have banned him from travelling overseas.He has not signalled a willingness to resign and in a speech on Thursday vowed he would “fight to the end” and defended the martial law decree as necessary to overcome political deadlock and protect the country from domestic politicians who are undermining democracy.Yoon, president of Asia’s fourth-largest economy, hopes political allies will rally to support him, but the fiery remarks appeared to find mixed reception among PPP lawmakers.A Gallup Korea poll on Friday had two-thirds of supporters of Yoon’s party opposing the impeachment, though three-quarters of all respondents supported it.Elected in 2022, Yoon was widely welcomed in Washington and other Western capitals for his rhetoric defending global democracy and freedom, but critics said that masked growing problems at home.He clashed with opposition lawmakers that he has labelled as “anti-state forces” and press freedom organisations have criticized his heavy-handed approach to media coverage that he deems negative.The crisis and ensuing uncertainty shook financial markets and threatened to undermine South Korea’s reputation as a stable, democratic success story.South Korean shares rose for a fourth straight session on Friday on hopes that the political uncertainty would ease after this weekend’s parliamentary impeachment vote. \nMost parts of Nepal will experience clear skies on Saturday, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.The day is expected to remain partly cloudy in the hilly regions of Koshi Province, while the rest of the country will enjoy mostly sunny weather. During the night, weather conditions are forecast to be mostly clear nationwide. The Division has warned of dense fog in the morning in several areas of the Terai and the Kathmandu Valley, which could temporarily disrupt transportation and daily activities. Authorities have advised caution to mitigate potential impacts. Nepal experienced clear skies on Friday, with Janakpur recording the highest temperature at 27.5°C and Jumla the lowest at -7.0°C, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division. \nIndian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has expressed deep satisfaction regarding the present status of “extremely robust bilateral ties” between Nepal and India. “He also conveyed that, as close neighbours, India and Nepal share similar perspectives on many issues of mutual concern,” the Ministry of Defence of India said in a statement issued after Chief of Army Staff of Nepal Ashok Raj Sigdel called on Singh in New Delhi on Thursday. “He [Singh] reiterated India’s intent to strengthen relations with its neighbours, in tune with the ‘neighbourhood first policy’.During the meeting they held discussions on a number of issues pertaining to bilateral relations, according to the ministry. Singh highlighted the various facets of defence cooperation including training, regular exercises, workshops and seminars to enhance the capability of Nepal Army as well as supply of defence equipment and stores, read the statement.Minister Singh congratulated the Chief of Army Staff of Nepal Sigdel on the conferment of honorary rank of General of the Indian Army. Nepali Army chief Sigdel, who is on a four-day visit to India, was conferred the Honorary Rank of General of the Indian Army by Indian President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday.This gesture continues the seven-decade-long tradition between Nepal and India of honouring each other's army chiefs with honorary ranks, reflecting the deep-rooted and strategic ties between the two nations’ armed forces.Sigdel’s visit follows Indian Army Chief General Dwivedi’s visit to Nepal in the third week of November. During the visit he was similarly conferred with the honorary rank of General of the Nepali Army by President Ramchandra Paudel. \nSadbhav Acharya won the Surya Nepal Kathmandu Open for his fourth major career title at the par-68 Royal Nepal Golf Club on Friday.Acharya came from one-shot down to beat pro Niraj Tamang by two strokes in the second event under the Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25. Nepal number one amateur golfer Acharya carded an impressive 6-under 62 to post the record winning total of 15-under 257 at the RNGC course, bettering Bhuvan Nagarkoti’s previous best of 14-under in the 2022-23 season.Tamang carded 3-under 65 in the final round and finished first among pros with the score of 13-under 259. He received a cheque of Rs125,000. Dinesh Prajapati finished third overall and second among pros with the score of 8-under 264 after he carded 3-under 65 in the final round. He earned Rs85,000.Rahul BK was fourth overall and second among amateurs after he carded 4-under 64 for a total score of 6-under 266. Nepal number one pro Bhuvan Nagarkoti was fifth overall and third among pros at 4-under 268. He carded 4-under 64 in the final round and claimed Rs68,000. Bishnu Prasad Sharma and Jayram Shrestha shared the sixth place at 3-under 269. Shrestha carded six straight birdies from the 13th to 18th holes on his way to carding 6-under 62, while Sharma played 3-over 71. They received Rs51,500 each. Sanjay Lama, Deepak Magar and Toran Bikram Shahi finished in top 10.Acharya took the turn at 4-under 30 and carded 2-under 32 on the back nine. He started the day with a birdie and added three more on the fourth, fifth and sixth holes. After taking the turn, he carded birdies on the 11th and 13th holes. Acharya did not drop a single shot on the last 47 holes and recorded a nine-stroke victory over BK in the amateur section.Overnight leader Tamang carded 4-under 30 on the front nine and played 1-over 35 on the back nine. He carded four birdies on the first, second, fourth and seventh holes and he dropped a shot on the 11th hole.Prajapati carded 2-under 32 on the front nine and he played 1-under 33 on the back nine. He carded birdies on the first, fourth, fifth and eighth holes, while he faced a double bogey on the seventh hole. Prajapati then carded birdies on the 10th and 13th holes before dropping a shot on the 14th hole.A total of 45 players—33 pros and 12 amateurs—took part in the tournament that carried a cash purse of Rs735,000. The next event of the Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, Surya Nepal Eastern Open, will be played at Dharan Golf Club from December 25-28. \nThe World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on Thursday approved a $100 million development policy operation (DPO) to help Nepal enhance its ongoing efforts to implement green, resilient, and inclusive development. The World Bank said in a statement that this is the second in a programmatic series of three DPOs designed to strengthen the enabling environment for Nepal’s sustainability pathway. “This programmatic DPO series is a catalyst for Nepal to build greater resilience and sustainability and drive and protect the basis for long-term growth for all Nepalis,” said David Sislen, World Bank regional country director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. “This operation supports Nepal’s policy programme in a variety of sectors, including green fiscal instruments, water security, irrigation, land use and management, sustainable forest management, and climate and disaster information systems.” Since 2021, the government has undertaken an ambitious programme of action focusing on environmental sustainability, resilience, and inclusive development. This approach, according to the statement, addresses intertwined challenges such as joblessness, pandemics, expanding economic opportunities for vulnerable groups, and climate and other environmental risks affecting Nepal’s people, prosperity, and environment. “The World Bank DPO series anchors Nepal’s ongoing shift to a more sustainable development path. Nepal’s policies supported by the DPO series arose from stakeholder dialogues and the nation’s own development priority programmes and plans,” the statement reads. It says that these policies aim to improve air quality, expand hydro-meteorological services for better disaster risk reduction, improve water security by boosting year-round irrigation and safe water supply, strengthen community forest management, and enhance land use planning.“Nepal continues to put in place a strong policy programme that recognises that resilience is best achieved when sustainability and inclusion are also pursued in an integrated way,” said Stephen Danyo, World Bank programme leader for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka and task team leader for the operation. \nBiratnagar Kings registered a commanding 51-run victory over Chitwan Rhinos in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Friday.Biratnagar opted to bat first after winning the toss, but their decision was quickly tested as they lost early wickets. Lokesh Bam was dismissed for a duck in the first over, and Dipak Bohara followed soon after for four. The Kings were in deep trouble at 4-2 in the first over.Scott Edwards failed to make an impact, departing for a golden duck, and Biratnagar were reeling at 10-3. However, Martin Guptill (45 off 35 balls) and Basir Ahamad (68 not out off 44 balls) steadied the ship with a crucial 88-run partnership. Ahamad’s power-hitting, including four boundaries and two sixes, gave the Kings the momentum they desperately needed.The pair guided Biratnagar to 98-4 by the 14th over. Ahamad and Rajesh Pulami (33 not out off 20 balls) then unleashed a flurry of boundaries, adding 83 unbeaten runs in quick time. Pulami’s rapid-fire knock ensured Biratnagar finished with a formidable total of 181-5 in 20 overs.Chasing 182, Chitwan started on a poor note. Hassan Eisakhil was trapped lbw by Basir Ahamad for 5, and Santosh Karki (28 off 25 balls) was caught by Basir off Sandeep Lamichhane, leaving the Rhinos at 56-2. Ravi Bopara’s departure for 20 off 24 balls, dismissed by Subash Bhandari, further hindered Chitwan’s progress.Kushal Malla (25) fell to Chris Sole, and the Rhinos were 64-4 in the 11th over. Basil Hameed was dismissed for 1, leaving Chitwan at 64/5. Amar Routela played a defiant knock of 42 off 29 balls but could not carry his side home. Once he was dismissed with the score at 129-6, the result was sealed.Chitwan finished at 130-6, falling short by 51 runs. Biratnagar’s bowlers, led by Lamichhane and Ahamad, kept the pressure on throughout the chase, ensuring a comfortable victory.This is Biratnagar’s second win in the NPL. With this victory, Biratnagar has garnered 4 points from six matches, keeping their slim hopes of making it to the playoffs alive.On the other hand, Chitwan suffered their third defeat in six matches, dealing a significant blow to their playoff aspirations. With six points from six matches, Chitwan remains in fourth place. \nSeven years and seven months after inking the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Nepal and China on Wednesday signed a framework for BRI cooperation during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit, which ends on Thursday.Acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the framework cooperation on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said. \nNepali officials were paid $2.5 million in bribes to seal the contract for the $209.6-million Airbus deal, the largest in Nepal’s aviation history, charging documents filed in the US court show.Deepak Sharma, a former executive of the US-based aviation services provider AAR, pleaded guilty in July earlier this year to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) anti-bribery provisions. The charges were based on allegations that Sharma was part of a conspiracy to bribe Nepali officials to secure two Airbus A330 deals in 2017.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.Sharma, a Nepal-born British citizen, joined AAR in 2015. Before this, he was the chief technical officer at AJW Group, which he joined in 2008. He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1]. Let me know if you want any changes made to the payment terms or bid terms so that it favours [Company 1]. I can ask these to be incorporated [sic] into the RFP for publication. I am meeting with the [Foreign Official 1] and Chairman this week…”On or about September 1, 2016, approximately one month before Nepal Airlines Corporation publicly issued the RFP, Foreign Official 1 sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify MOU signing date, purchase agreement date and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor of Company 1] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, Foreign Official 1 texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”On May 15, 2018, Sharma sent Individual 1 a text message about Intermediary and Foreign Official 1 pressuring to pay Company 5’s invoice, writing, “The Nepali guys is [sic] chasing like hell.”On May 17, 2018, Sharma sent an email to Individual 1 with an attached invoice from Company 5 to Company 3 for $450,000 for “Service Provided for Bid and Sale of X2A330 as an Advance.”On July 3, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused a wire transfer of approximately 390,000 EURO (the equivalent of roughly $450,000) from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, in part for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1On August 9, 2018, the Intermediary emailed Sharma, attaching two invoices from Company 5 to Company 3 for $1,000,000 each for “Service Provided for Bid and sale of X2 A330 as an Advance.”On August 10, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused two wire transfers of approximately $1,000,000 each from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, partly for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1. \nNepal has almost everything it needs for prosperity: A strategic location, tourism potential, hydropower and a young population. Yet, we are trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth and high migration. When the Constitution was finally promulgated two decades after the launch of the Maoist People’s War, we expected politics to be our salvation. Unfortunately, it has become our prison.Nepal's low-growth, high-migration trap isn't just an economic phenomenon—it's a political protection mechanism that preserves an unsustainable kleptocracy and crony capitalism. While the World Bank calls for a “systematic assault” on economic barriers, what Nepal needs is a paradigm shift that will fundamentally transform power relations and dismantle extractive networks.Without such a shift, emerging political agency and a growing structural crisis will create a rupture. The absence of comprehensive political and economic reforms is a matter of serious concern for Nepalis. It does not just affect our graduation to a middle-income status, which has already been pushed behind schedule; it also impacts the lives of millions of people and determines Nepal’s development trajectory.The trapSince the World Bank's initial analysis in 2017, Nepal's “low-growth, high-migration trap” has deepened. According to the World Bank, low-growth fails to generate employment. As a result, a large number of youth are forced to migrate. Migration brings in remittance, enabling consumption but no productive investment. High remittance not only creates economic distortions, but also reduces pressure on the top leaders to deliver reforms. The lack of reforms, in turn, reinforces low growth.Despite poverty reduction, Nepal has been growing at only about 4 percent, marginally better than the 2 percent growth achieved in 2023. At this rate, Nepal will be unable to graduate from LDC at least until 2030.Nepal’s economic trends and fiscal positions are becoming increasingly unsustainable, creating pressures for change. For example, budget execution rates are below 80 percent, revenue collection is dwindling, capital expenditure is low, and the debt service burden is rising.While the per capita income remains at around $1,400, limiting job creation, the manufacturing sector’s GDP share has shrunk by half since 2008. While migration is increasing, fiscal indicators are worsening. Our dependence on migration is growing. While public debt is about 44 percent of the GDP, our revenues are shrinking. Debt servicing and financial management consume almost 20 percent of the budget, while development expenditure has shrunk to 19 percent and is poorly executed.Political agencyThe kleptocracy, patronised by top political leaders, extracts power and money from the people and the state. In doing so, they misuse state power, distort its bodies and hollow out legal institutions. Despite this, political agency has failed to drive change.Institutions like the World Bank have been advocating comprehensive reforms. For example, they want to break policy barriers, build new growth sources, revitalise agriculture, address migration issues and unleash financial reforms. These reforms would make the economy more competitive, productive and broad-based. All of these recommendations directly impact the existing extractive system dominated by crony capitalism, kleptocracy and political parties. Initiating changes would mean changing the status quo, which is why these suggestions fail.The failure of new parties to put pressure on traditional parties has not helped. When the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) emerged just before the 2022 elections, it was largely driven by the aspirations of migrant workers. However, the ethical dilemma posed by evidence of corruption of RSP’s founder has dented the party’s aspirations. When the current coalition was forged, one of the objectives was to deliver results to the people to show them that there was no need for new parties. This strategy has failed. However, the new parties have met the same fate, ultimately benefiting the entrenched leaders. One of the results of this mismatch between people’s expectations and political delivery is the reluctance of people to identify themselves with a political party. Rather, the disenchantment and dissatisfaction echo in social media in fragmented ways. Activism has not worked because people have become distrustful of not only political parties but also activists who claim to represent civil society.Incremental reforms?There are enough people who believe that incremental reforms in the economy will add up and drive change. Some people are also hopeful that the traditional parties are feeling the pressure and will reform, albeit slowly. Then there are others who think we must seek alternatives to the current political system. Many of them tout China as a model of growth and aspire to have “political stability.”None of these approaches will work, unfortunately.Traditional solutions offered by donors and development partners often fail because they cannot address political-economy factors and political dynamics. These solutions focus on the symptoms rather than the root causes. Incremental reforms are often absorbed by the system, with all its deformities. And when the reforms are significant, the kleptocracy swiftly neutralises the attempts.For a few years, the traditional political parties could create the illusion of change, but all that the superficial democracy did was maintain the status quo. The current political system is rooted in extractive kleptocracy because the parties need each other to survive. Reforms will undermine the sources of political power and wealth. Therefore, political reform is impossible without disrupting the existing political power models.The current political malaise has discredited the whole democratic system. Seeking an alternative to the democratic system, however, is not an option. According to renowned economists, democracies perform at least 20 percent better than non-democracies in delivering prosperity. Democracies can also deliver more investment, economic reforms and public goods.A likely ruptureYes, the emergence of new political forces has faltered. Yet, this is only a temporary blip. At least four quarters are pressing for transformation in our political and economic system: the migrant population, urban youth, a traditionalist nationalist force allied with the former monarchy and a liberal-minded civil society. Even if political agency and social movements have failed to produce well-thought-out political movements, structural factors will continue to push for change because the status quo is untenable, and it is little prepared for shocks that may come from unexpected quarters.New structural pressures are building: Demographic transition creates new demands, digital transformation rearranges political psychology and regional economic integration forces competitiveness. Demographic pressures, economic vulnerabilities, migration impacts and urbanisation pressures will continue to generate strain until the status quo breaks.Our hope is that political agency and the structural crisis will align so that we are able to manage the transformation in a meaningful way. Otherwise, instability and chaos will become unavoidable. \nThe debut edition of the Nepal Premier League Twenty20 cricket tournament is set to kick off on Saturday with a festive atmosphere and with so much anticipation that it could write a new chapter in Nepali cricket.Billed as the ‘Festival of Himalayas’, the NPL has already attracted global interest, with the likes of former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan and New Zealand allrounder James Neesham, among other big cricketing names, set to light up the eight-team competition that will run until December 21.The involvement of Star Sports Network—a group of Indian television sports channels that also holds the rights of flagship tournaments like Indian Premier League, English Premier League, Wimbledon and ICC events—as the official broadcasting partner will now give the league a worldwide exposure.Partnership with Twenty-first Century Media (TCM) Sports—a sports management company that has managed Cricket World Cups, Asia Cups, IPL and other international events—is further evidence that the NPL aspires to evolve into one of the major cricketing events in the world.Organiser Cricket Association of Nepal appears determined to make the league a landmark event, aiming to propel Nepali cricket into an unprecedented era of growth and global recognition.“The organisation of the NPL is itself a big achievement for CAN and Nepali cricket,” CAN Spokesperson Chhumbi Lama told the Post.“For the first time, our domestic tournament will be broadcast worldwide, making the NPL the ideal platform to elevate Nepali cricket to the international stage,” Lama added. “The inaugural league could be a catalyst for Nepali cricket’s golden era.”CAN has laid out ambitious plans to expand the league in future editions, including multi-venue matches, games under floodlights, and a potential home-and-away format within five years.“This year, the NPL will be hosted at TU Cricket Ground, but as eight cricket stadiums are currently under construction, we plan to expand to cities outside the Kathmandu Valley,” Lama said. “If floodlights are installed at TU Ground, the future matches will be even more spectacular.”CAN has also developed a comprehensive business strategy to ensure the league’s sustainability, with goals to attract government investment and international grants.“This will take Nepali cricket into a commercial era, paving the way for further development of the game,” Lama added. CAN is making another effort to establish its own franchise league in the country following a debacle of its previous venture. It had organised Nepal T20 League in the 2022/23 season but the tournament proved a disaster as it was overshadowed by spot-fixing allegations, resulting in the involvement of Central Investigation Bureau and several arrests.CAN also faced criticisms for its mismanagement, negligence and incompetence. Eventually, the contract with Seven3Sports, to which the tournament rights were sold for eight years without a competitive bidding process, had to be terminated.This time, CAN, in its renewed effort to establish a successful franchise cricket league, seems committed to implementing stringent measures to safeguard the integrity of the NPL.Retired AIG Ishwor Babu Karki, who is the Head of Integrity at CAN and oversees anti-corruption, safeguarding, security and anti-doping for the cricket governing body, will lead the oversight unit during the NPL.“We have taken previous mistakes as a lesson. The NPL will be fair,” said Lama.“Karki will oversee the integrity of the NPL. CAN has also coordinated with all the concerned departments to make sure things comply with the ICC protocol,” he added.“CAN wants to assure that the league will be without any controversy.”The NPL—which is building on the foundation laid by earlier tournaments like Everest Premier League, Dhangadhi Premier League and Pokhara Premier League—is also positioning itself as a game-changer for domestic cricket, with the promise of becoming a vital financial lifeline for domestic players.A major highlight is the league’s title sponsorship deal with Siddhartha Bank Limited, which is being hailed as the largest sponsorship agreement in Nepali sports history. However, the exact figures of the agreement have not been disclosed.Eight franchise teams—Biratnagar Kings, Chitwan Rhinos, Janakpur Bolts, Karnali Yaks, Kathmandu Gurkhas, Lumbini Lions, Pokhara Avengers and Sudurpaschim Royals—collectively spent more than Rs50 million rupees in the auction. They secured marquee players for 2 million each, while the players graded into A B and C categories were auctioned at base prices ranging from Rs20,000 to Rs1.5 million.The big investment underscores the league’s ambition to redefine the profile of cricket in Nepal and provide robust financial support to domestic players.While CAN provides monthly incentives to national players, NPL offers a new pathway for many domestic cricketers to build sustainable careers within the country. The tournament will nurture the next generation of cricketing talent by offering them a platform to showcase their skills and catch the attention of national selectors. Each franchise has identified a local iconic player through talent hunts, further strengthening the grassroots impact of the league.“The NPL will be a big support to domestic cricketers,” Lama said. “The players are very motivated by the initiative. It also lays the ground for grassroots cricket development as the teams have conducted talent hunts in the provinces they represent. And the exciting participation of hundreds of teenagers in the hunts is further evidence of the game’s popularity.”In addition to spotlighting emerging players, the NPL offers national cricketers a global stage to showcase their abilities.“The NPL provides an opportunity for national and domestic players to share the field with foreign professionals and world’s best cricketers. This will help them learn, grow, and improve as cricketers,\" said former national player Sharad Vesawkar, who will represent Chitwan Rhinos in the NPL.Vesawkar also emphasised how the league will help highlight Nepali talent to the world while providing a financial boost to local players aspiring to build careers in cricket. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nNhasala Joshi, co-founder and executive director of Women Leaders in Technology (WLiT), a non-profit that empowers young women in STEAM fields, sat down with the Post's Timila Maharjan. In this conversation, Joshi highlights the role of poetry and literature in her personal and professional growth. She is an engineer turned development practitioner, passionate about using data and technology to shape an inclusive digital future.What sparked your interest in literature?Since school, I have never been interested in reading textbooks. Instead, I was drawn to non-academic books. I still remember an activity from 8th grade in our Compulsory English workbook: I had to write a poem. My English teacher praised my poem and encouraged me to write and read more. That moment sparked my interest in poetry and creative writing.I don’t recall the first book I read, but ‘Seto Bagh’ by Diamond Shumsher Rana is one of the earliest books I enjoyed. I read its English translation back then while trying to improve my English. To this day, it remains a book I recommend to everyone.What encourages you to write poems?I started writing poems for myself. It was a personal space to process and express my thoughts and emotions. I’ve performed slam poetry several times and shared some pieces on my Instagram. In fact, my first Instagram post was a poem.When I was younger, I was influenced by the poems I read and often tried to emulate their style. Over time, I feel I have developed my voice, an accumulation of the different poetry styles I’ve encountered. At various points in my life, I was reading works by BP Koirala, Sarah Kay, and Pablo Neruda, each of whom deepened my love for poetry and shaped my perspective.Although I’ve written poems only a handful of times, I want to continue exploring this creative outlet. However, there was a period when I became overly critical of my writing, which made me hesitant to share my work. On top of that, my busy work schedule interrupted my writing. Despite these setbacks, my passion for poetry remains, and I hope to return to it more consistently.What kind of books do you read? I don’t have a specific favourite book genre—it changes frequently. Over different phases of my life, I’ve explored a variety of books. During my school days, I was drawn to historical fiction and spent some time delving into books on Hindu mythology. While I read fiction in the past, my work has recently steered me toward nonfiction and leadership-related books.Since I primarily work from home without fixed hours, my work often extends throughout the day. To maintain balance, I set aside two hours daily to read a few pages. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to keep up with that routine, though I hope to return to it soon.These days, I find myself more inclined toward short stories. They’re easy to read, and I can finish them quickly, which fits well with my schedule. During the Covid pandemic, I was part of a small book group where we read short stories and shared opinions. At a time when nothing felt certain, reading short stories became the highlight of my day.Since then, my interest in short stories has grown. If I choose to read fiction, I usually gravitate toward short stories. Even during busy times, I enjoy them because they’re quick to finish yet engaging.Have books influenced your journey so far?Every book I’ve read has influenced me in some way. While I can’t pinpoint specific books that have shaped my personal or professional journey, I believe all the books I’ve encountered have contributed to my nature, personality, understanding, and opinions. Each book leaves behind impressions, and certain parts always resonate with me, influencing me in one way or another.Poetry books have influenced my journey, often helping me navigate difficult times. Books written by women and about women’s stories have shaped my understanding of feminism, womanhood, and even my work. Reading stories of women written by women became a way to share their vulnerabilities and learn from their experiences.Books like ‘We Should All Be Feminists’ and ‘Invisible Women’ have deepened my advocacy for greater representation of women in technology. Additionally, Pablo Neruda's poetry has been a constant source of inspiration.When I was working as an engineer, the book ‘Change by Design’ influenced me.Name a few books that comforted you.Books by Sarah Kay and Sabrina Benon have helped me in my hard times. ‘Depression and Other Magic Trick’ by Sabrina Benaim comforts me. ‘Leaves of Grass’ by Walt Whitman is one of the books I keep returning to. It is a poetry collection, and one poem, ‘A Song of Myself,’ is one of my favourites from the book. It calms me when I’m anxious and reminds me to slow down and appreciate life’s moments.How has reading helped you lead your organisation?Books written by women have played a key role in my leadership journey. When I started working in gender data and with WLiT, I came across ‘Invisible Women’. This led me to explore more literature on leadership, which has been instrumental in shaping my role at WLiT.However, beyond books, I’ve found value in reading articles, blogs, and magazines like Harvard Business Review, Medium, Clark Magazine, and Granta Magazine. These resources have been helpful in session planning and developing organisational strategies. I remember searching for a book to understand organisational strategy when a friend, who was also leading a company, recommended Harvard Business Review. That recommendation shifted my focus to reviews and blogs.Do you have a favourite place to read?I love reading in the comfort of my bed, where I can have uninterrupted personal space. Public places like cafes don’t work because I need solitude to immerse myself in a book.Nhasala Joshi’s book recommendationsLeaves of GrassAuthor: Walt WhitmanPublisher: SelfYear: 1855The story encourages you to pause and reflect on why you’re always in a hurry.

Albom’s books always make you think deep. \nFive months after the CPN (Unified Socialist) retained Madhav Kumar Nepal and Ghanashyam Bhusal as its party chair and general secretary, respectively, the party leadership is still struggling to assign responsibilities of major departments and committees.The Unified Socialist, which was formed by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML in August 2021, held its general convention in the first week of July and unanimously reelected Nepal and Bhusal as party chief and general secretary, respectively, and decided to elect other 19 office bearers through a voting process.However, it took two months for the task as they could elect other office bearers only in the last week of August.The party called a standing committee meeting on Wednesday with an agenda to discuss and finalise the work divisions of the leaders, among other things. However, the party leadership has failed to assign the responsibilities of departments, district in-charges, and various party bodies.Party leaders claimed that they agreed to defer the agenda for Friday citing that the party needed further discussion on the subject.“The party has almost completed the task of the work division, but we still need a little more time for the discussion,” Jagannath Khatiwada, a party leader, told the Post. “The final list of the work division will be announced on Friday.”Earlier, the leaders said that the division of work of the leaders would be proposed on Wednesday and endorsed by Thursday.Dissatisfied by the delay in assigning the responsibilities, a group of leaders even submitted a memorandum to the party office a few months earlier.Failing to resolve the issue, leaders in November formed a task force led by party chair Nepal that included senior leader Jhalanath Khanal, Beduram Bhusal, Pramesh Hamal, Ghanendra Basnet, Rajendra Pandey, and General Secretary Bhusal.Party secretary Somnath Pandey claimed that the delay was caused not due to disputes but due to festivals and other engagements.“The party has almost completed the work division task and it will accommodate all the leaders. Even some leaders who were earlier said to be dissatisfied will get important responsibilities,” Pandey said. He said preparations were in the final stage to make the responsibilities public on Friday.There was widespread dissatisfaction in the party regarding the selection of office bearers, politburo members, and central committee members.Pandey said that the party is preparing to assign responsibilities of all levels of committees on the basis of the ‘one-post, one-person’ concept, meaning that a leader will be given a role in one position to ensure that party leaders get roles in a judicious way.He added that the system would also help manage leaders at all levels and further strengthen the organisation. \nNepal’s two largest and ruling parties were busy in internal meetings in the past few days. The Nepali Congress central executive committee met on Monday, while the CPN-UML held a meeting of the party's secretariat on Tuesday.The main topic of discussion in both parties' meetings was Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s recent visit to China and the agreements reached during that visit.The two parties, meanwhile, have differences over the visit and the eventual agreements, especially the framework for the BRI cooperation. The government on Tuesday made the copy of the BRI cooperation framework public.Raghubir Mahaseth, a member of the UML secretariat and head of its foreign affairs department, said that the secretariat meeting had declared the prime minister's visit as a success. “As per last week’s deal between the two countries, projects would be implemented either through grants, loans or joint investment,” Mahaseth said. But the Congress meeting insisted that Nepal cannot and should not accept loans to fund BRI projects, according to joint secretary of the party, Jeevan Pariyar.“It has been our official stance that Nepal should not take loans to fund BRI projects. Our party understands the phrasing ‘Aid Assistance Financing’ in the BRI framework to mean that the country will take only grants,” Pariyar told the Post. Prime Minister Oli, however, has said that it can be either a loan or a grant. “BRI funding can be a loan, a grant, or joint investment,\" Oli said in Birtamod, Jhapa on Monday. “Some people are shouting without understanding what BRI actually means.” “If the BRI framework involves loans as well, why did the prime minister lie at a press conference at Kathmandu airport after returning from China, when he said there was no agreement to take loans?” questioned Congress joint general secretary Pariyar.The Congress calling for developing BRI projects under grants does not mean the party is against cooperation with China, Pariyar said.Congress former general secretary and influential leader Krishna Prasad Sitaula also says that the party’s decision on Monday on the financial modality for BRI projects is official. When asked whether the two ruling parties’ differing understandings of the funding method for BRI projects will affect government functioning, Sitaula denied such a possibility.“Even if the two parties have different views on the BRI financing modality there should be no difficulty in cooperation,” Situla told the Post. Mahaseth echoes Situala. The agreement was done in presence of leaders from both the parties so it should not attract any confusion, Mahaseth said. “For us, the only thing that matters is the opinion of the establishment wing of the Congress,” says UML publicity department chief Rajendra Gautam. Gautam says that what other Congress leaders say on the issue is not so important, given that the establishment wing of the Congress has already welcomed the agreement on BRI cooperation.“Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba himself has endorsed the agreement between Nepal and China under the framework for BRI cooperation,” Gautam said. “To manage the political camps in the party, they might be saying different things, but that does not carry any importance.”Again, there is no particular reason to oppose the agreement between the two countries since the agreement was done as per the blueprint prepared by a Congress-UML task force, Gautam stressed. Also, the agreement was inked in presence of Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba who is also a leader of Congress, Gautam said. Not only on the issue of BRI, the Congress also appears to be dissatisfied with other agreements reached during the Prime Minister Oli’s visit to China and some of the points made in the joint statement.Govindaraj Pokharel, Congress leader close to Shekhar Koirala and a former chair of the National Planning Commission, gave a few reasons suggesting that Nepal has deviated from the conventional foreign policy of the country which is non-alliance and the Panchsheel.Nepal used the Chinese name Xizang for Tibet and by agreeing to firmly support China’s effort to reunite Taiwan into mainland China, Nepal deviated from its foreign policy, Pokharel argued. Head of Foreign Affairs Department of UML, Mahaseth challenges Pokharel saying, “The agreement done during Prime Minister’s China visit aligns with the foreign policy of the country.”Nepal has been a staunch supporter of One China and the agreement has not deviated from it, Mahaseth added.“Being the signature party on the framework for the BRI cooperation under the ‘Aid Assistance Financing’, the Congress in future only can raise questions on the terms and conditions of the financial assistance, but it has to abide by the agreement. So supporting the document was a mistake by the party,” says Pokharel.The coalition government of Congress and UML has agreed to take soft loan, grant and technical assistance for the projects of Nepal’s interest under the BRI. Despite the party's official decision not to take loan, what made party members agree on the ‘Technical support and Aid Financing Modality’?” questioned Pokharel.Pokharel also hinted that the issue of agreement reached would stir up controversy in the party.  \nA year before the scheduled 15th general convention of the Nepali Congress, leaders from the party’s dissident faction have started exerting pressure on the leadership to hold the event on time.Shekhar Koirala, the Congress’s dissident faction leader, convened a gathering of chiefs of the party’s local units on December 3 in his hometown Biratnagar, demanding that the 15th general convention be held by mid-December next year.Addressing the gathering, he urged all the participants to start a pressure campaign for a timely convention from each of the local units they lead. “The longer the period the general convention is deferred, the weaker the party will become,” he said.On various occasions of late, Koirala has been consistently demanding that the party hold the convention as stipulated in the party statute.However, several party leaders the Post talked to see no chance of the party holding its national gathering on time. Congress, often dubbed the country’s grand old party, held its 14th general convention in mid-December 2021, and should hold the next convention by mid-December 2025 as per the party statute. If the party is to hold its general convention a year later, it should have started the convention-related activities by now but it hasn’t, says a leader.Krishna Paudel, the party office’s chief secretary, said Congress needs to resolve issues related to active party membership before starting the process of the convention.Of the total 165 federal electoral constituencies, the issues of active party membership have been resolved only in the Kathmandu-4 constituency, according to party leaders.“Apart from this, the Congress needs to amend its statute to address various challenges the party is facing in the changing context and for that, the party will soon form a statute amendment committee,” Paudel said. “Despite pressure from a section to hold the general convention by the end of next year, the party is unlikely to do so.”The party statute gives each elected body a four-year tenure. However, the party charter provisions a one-year extension if the general convention cannot take place within four years. Further, Nepal’s constitution also envisions that political parties hold their conventions every five years. Article 269 (4) (b) of the constitution requires a political party to hold its general convention at least once every five years. In special circumstances, the constitution allows the event to be postponed for six months citing a valid reason.Congress leadership went for maximum extension allowed by the statute before holding the last general convention. Fearing that President Sher Bahadur Deuba could repeat the same situation, the Koirala-led faction plans to compel the party establishment to adhere to the party charter’s four-year gap between the two conventions as there is no crisis barring the party from holding the event.During the Mahasamiti meeting held in February, Gagan Thapa, a general secretary of the party, presented his organisational paper and proposed concluding the conventions of lower party committees by the end of November (last month). Under the plan, conventions of the ward units should have been held by the end of November, and conventions of village and city committees should have been held by the middle of this month.Thapa at the Mahasamiti meeting had proposed concluding the party’s all district conventions by mid-September 2025, provincial conventions by mid-November, and the general convention by mid-December 2025. The Congress chooses its leadership from the ward level to the centre through the conventions. The party conducts four tiers of direct elections. And general convention delegates are elected by and from among them.The organisational paper presented by the general secretary was endorsed by the Mahasamiti meeting, provided that it could also be amended by the central committee meeting. The subsequent central committee meeting of the party held in August also passed the paper presented by Thapa.Nevertheless, none of the party’s general convention-related activities have started in the lower units as per the schedule.Mahalaxmi Upadhyaya, a joint general secretary of the Congress, says that despite the party statute mentioning holding the general convention within four years, party history suggests that it gets extended at least by one year in accordance with the party charter.Several Congress leaders said that Deuba wouldn’t convene the general convention before taking charge of the government as per his deal with the CPN-UML.As per the Congress-UML agreement reached while forming the two-party government in July, Congress President Deuba will become prime minister after two years of signing the two-party deal.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli upon his arrival from the China visit on December 5 said that he would hand over the government leadership to Deuba after 18 months. If Congress follows the party statute to hold the general convention, it should take place just after a year, but Deuba will get the reins of government only 18 months later.Citing that, many Congress leaders said that Deuba will not hold the party's general convention without first taking charge of the government.“Since Deuba already has announced he won’t be in the race for the party's top position, becoming prime minister after relinquishing the post of party president might be difficult,” said a party leader.He may feel that his prospect of becoming prime minister as per the understanding with the UML might be in risk once a new leader elected from the convention heads the party, the leaders said.In the last general convention held in 2021 when Deuba and Koirala were contesting for the post of party president after the first round remained indecisive, Deuba while seeking the vote in the runoff had requested votes from the delegates saying his position of prime minister may not continue should he not remain the party chief.So Deuba will try to take the government reins before conducting the party convention, leaders say.Upadhyaya, however, differs.“The convention may not take place next year because no substantive preparation has yet begun,” she said, “not because his premiership will be challenged for not being the party chief.” \nRastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is currently in police custody under charges of cooperative frauds, organised crime, and money laundering, has been taken to Birgunj for further investigation.Lamichhane, who was arrested on October 18 from RSP’s central office in Kathmandu, was initially taken to Kaski for questioning. On Monday, he was flown from Pokhara to Kathmandu and then to Simara and transported by road to Birgunj, where investigations into the case will continue.In addition to Lamichhane, Chhabilal Joshi, another prominent figure and former deputy inspector general of Police, who is associated with the Gorkha Media Network, was also moved to Birgunj. Joshi and Lamichhane are accused of embezzling funds from the Sanopaila Savings and Credit Cooperative in Birgunj.Both Lamichhane and Joshi had previously been remanded in police custody after Kaski District Court extended their detention on Sunday by an additional four days for further investigation. Lamichhane’s detention has been repeatedly extended since his initial arrest, with previous remands ranging from 6 to 15 days.Lamichhane and Joshi, among others, have been interrogated in Kaski, Rupandehi, Kathmandu and Chitwan as well on cooperative frauds.Various reports of studies and probes conducted by police, special parliamentary probe panel, local governments and other agencies have found the involvement of RSP chief Lamichhane, Joshi and several other individuals in embezzling deposits of cooperatives based in Kathmandu, Kaski, Rupandehi, Chitwan and Birgunj. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \n\nOn October 27, around 50 individuals of a high-profile group of American corporate CEOs flew to Everest for a sightseeing tour. Over 15 chopper flights were conducted from Lukla to 5,545 meter-high Kala Patthar. They clicked photos and selfies for a few minutes and returned to Kathmandu.The group spent nearly Rs16.20 million on chopper reservations, excluding other expenses such as hotels, transport, and national park fees, which could be worth millions of dollars.“They were high-end visitors to Nepal, who had money but no time,” said Anil Manandhar, corporate manager of Shree Airlines, Nepal’s largest helicopter operator. “As high-end tourism contributes to the long-term economic welfare of destinations, the government must know how to promote them.”But on Wednesday, chopper operators received a big jolt—beyond their imagination.From January 1, choppers will be barred from conducting sightseeing tours in the Everest region.The Sagarmatha National Park, which hosts Mt Everest, issued a circular informing all helicopter companies that they can no longer operate sightseeing flights in the national park.“We are taking this unpopular decision to provide justice to wildlife,” said Sushma Rana, senior conservation officer of the park, which has headquarters at Namche Bazaar. Helicopters have also been banned from transporting cargo above Pangboche at 3,985 metres above sea level.“The rule, however, will not apply to rescue flights,” said Rana.The park was established on July 19, 1976, and covers an area of 1,148 square kilometres in the Solukhumbu district. In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural phenomena and unique culture, the park was included on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list. “The chopper-ban is a very strange decision that will deal a huge blow to high-end tourism,” said Manandhar. Already, there are restrictions. From Kathmandu, helicopters can carry four passengers in a light and medium helicopter up to Lukla. From Lukla, the chopper can take only two passengers to Kala Patthar. Choppers are restricted from landing at the Everest base camp but can make an overfly.So, the tour operator’s itinerary usually includes the Kathmandu-Lukla-Kala Patthar flight. From there, tourists take lunch at Everest View Hotel in Syangboche and fly back.Revenue-wise, a tourist pays around Rs10,000 under different categories: Rs3,000 for park conservation, Rs2,000 for village development, and Rs900 for airport. Separately, helicopters pay Rs3,000 for each landing and parking.“The Everest sightseeing tour is Nepal’s premium product, which we have not marketed well. It can bring high-end tourists from around the world,” said Manandhar. In the peak season, there are 8-10 such flights. On Thursday, operators held an emergency meeting with the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the civil aviation regulator. The Airlines Operators’ Association of Nepal said it would only honour the regulator's decision. Issuing a press statement on Thursday evening, the association said it would not abide by the decision made by the national park as the civil aviation regulator has the sole authority to ban flights. The association, the umbrella body of the airline companies, said it would continue flights.The national park has many complaints about helicopter companies that prompted it to make such a drastic decision.Rana said they analysed three significant factors, which ultimately resulted in such an unpopular move. First, excessive noise pollution. The noise pollution in the wildlife habitat has resulted in behavioural changes in the local animals. “The sounds can cause wild animals to leave their habitat and run into the villages. Our studies show that accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising,” Rana said. The shy natural goral is found foraging and sheltering in rocky faces of mountains.“The animals jump off the cliffs in shock when choppers fly at low altitudes with big sounds. Their death cases are rising. We are doing justice to the wild animals by stopping commercial flights above the national park.”Second, according to Rana, the park has long warned helicopters to stop haphazard landings. “But no one has abided by this decision. Besides, we suspect the smuggling of wildlife contraband,” said Rana.“If helicopters ignore landing in the designated areas, we obviously cannot monitor them all. This gives us room to suspect that they are involved in smuggling.”Third, the locals say the rise in heli tours has cut their jobs. Usually, it takes 14 days for trekkers to reach Everest base camp. But most of them return by helicopter. “So chopper ride has cut jobs of porters and guides, and also affected businesses of tea houses and resorts in the Everest region,” said Rana.The park alone did not decide to ban sightseeing. Multiple stakeholders, including the local government and the local people, are involved. The Nepal Army and local youth groups have been tasked with monitoring the ban.This is not the first time the park tried to ban sightseeing flights.In October, the park office in Namche wrote to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal in Lukla, requesting a ban on helicopter flights for commercial purposes over the national park. Tour operators say that honest chopper companies have been made to suffer due to the wrongdoings of a few unethical ones that breach rules for “quick profit”. “And now authorities have imposed a blanket ban,” complained a top official of a helicopter company. In 2018, Nepal ordered a review of helicopter rescues after uncovering a multimillion-dollar scam in which climbers were pressured to take costly flights down mountains, sometimes by spiking their food. Unscrupulous operators pocketed thousands of dollars from insurance companies by making multiple claims for a single chopper ride or pushing trekkers to agree to airlifts for minor illnesses.Scammers can charge thousands of dollars for a helicopter rescue.According to Rana, the conservation officer, more than 6,000 choppers fly above the national park in the spring and autumn seasons. Rescue flights for tourists and trekkers will still be allowed. However, they, too, must secure recommendation letters from nearby health institutions, buffer zone committees, or ward offices. According to operators, rescue operations were already lengthy. “Now, the process could be impossible to complete.” These flights must be approved by the park office, and detailed records of the individuals to be rescued must be submitted. According to the new rule, the rescue chopper should be fully equipped, and the patient should be treated at Pasang Lhamu-Nicole Niquille Hospital in Lukla. \nThe 140-megawatt Tanahu hydropower project in the Tanahun district has achieved 63 percent physical progress, raising hopes of power production by its stipulated completion deadline of May 2026.Divided into three packages, the overall financial progress of the project is 58 percent.Nepal has only two storage projects—Kulekhani I (60 MW) and Kulekhani II (32 MW).The project, which will be Nepal’s third storage type, is 150 km west of Kathmandu on the Seti river near Damauli in the Tanahun district.Shyamji Bhandari, project chief, said grouting is being done in the lower level area of ​​the main dam under package 1. Grouting is one of the most popular methods for controlling water leaking in fill dam constructions.According to him, a 140-metre tall dam will be constructed on the Seti river, which flows through the border of Rishing Rural Municipality-1 and Byas Municipality-5 in Tanahun district.“We are preparing to start constructing the main dam soon,” Bhandari said.The first package—a 140-metre-tall dam and other structures—is being constructed by a joint venture of Song Da Corporation, Vietnam, and Kalika Construction Pvt Ltd. Bhandari said that the physical progress of the first package has reached 36 percent.Similarly, under package 2, work has been underway on the concrete lining, a layer of cement placed on the subbase of the 1,493-metre-long tunnel starting from the reservoir's intake and ending at the penstock pipe.Bhandari said the installation of the penstock pipe is in the final stage.\"The water from the main tunnel will be released through a 213-metre-long penstock pipe to a powerhouse, which will be underground,\" he said.The hydro-mechanical works have been contracted to Sinohydro Corporation of China.The project said the construction of the powerhouse is also in the final stage, adding that the construction of the switchyard and installation of equipment in the powerhouse are underway. The physical progress of package two is about 62 percent.KEC International Limited India is undertaking package 3, which consists of building a 220 kV double-circuit transmission line from Damauli to Bharatpur in Chitwan.According to the project, out of the 94 towers in the 34.7 km transmission line, the foundation of 78 towers has been laid, and 69 towers have been erected. The progress of this package is 74 percent.The project said the overall construction is set to be completed by May 2026.The project will be one of Nepal’s biggest storage-type projects, with an estimated annual energy generation capacity of 587.7 GWh for the first 10 years and 489.9 GWh from the 11th year. During the dry season, the project can generate energy for six hours daily.The project is being co-funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the European Investment Bank.A $150 million loan agreement was signed with the ADB on February 21, 2013. A similar loan agreement for $183 million was signed with JICA on March 13, 2013, and an agreement with the European Investment Bank on May 7, 2013, for a $70 million loan, which was later increased to $85 million.The government and the Nepal Electricity Authority will use their money to build the infrastructure during pre-construction. The project is estimated to cost $505 million, and the Nepal government will contribute $86 million.On Monday, a team consisting ADB country director for Nepal Arnaud Cauchois and Nepal Electricity Authority executive director Kulman Ghising, including the chairman of the board of directors of Tanahu Hydropower Limited, conducted on-site monitoring of the project and instructed it to complete the construction on time.Under the project's social development programme, the rural electrification and distribution system to electrify Tanahun district has been completed through the project management directorate of the Nepal Authority.Under this, two 33/11 kV substations for local electricity supply have been built and operated in Ghiring Rural Municipality-4 and Bandipur Rural Municipality-6.A 33 kV line has been constructed to supply electricity to the substations.The project said that distribution transformers of different capacities have been installed, and 11 kV lines have been constructed in various places to make the electricity supply of Tanahun district sufficient, reliable and of good quality.Under the community development programme, 63 projects, including education, health, drinking water, roads, river embankment construction, etc., have been completed in the project-affected areas. Ten projects are currently running. Various skill-based trainings are being conducted to generate livelihood and income for project-affected people.Tanahu Hydropower Limited, a subsidiary of Nepal Electricity Authority, has also advanced the development of the 126MW Lower Seti Hydropower project downstream of the Seti river.The Consultant, JV of WAPCOS Limited, India and Nippon Koei Co. Ltd, Japan, submitted the final Detailed Design Report in June 2024. \nRajkali Rawat of ward 7 of Patarasi Rural Municipality in Jumla, in mid-western Nepal, had not heard about homestays until a few years ago.Now, along with five other women, she runs a thriving community homestay. She is busy nowadays offering hospitality to her guests. Her homestay offers food made from traditional cereals like buckwheat, millet, foxtail millet, marsi rice, and beans, among other crops. Tourists are attracted to the organic dishes and traditional culture offered in homestays.“I used to think operating a homestay would be a lot of hassle. But I was wrong,” said Rawat. “It has become a good source of income.”In a homestay, tourists live in people's homes, share meals, and experience local life and culture. Living in a Nepali village as a homestay guest is perhaps one of the fastest and best ways to get to know the real Nepal. Daily cultural activities are a major attraction of the homestay scheme. The women of Patmara opened their community homestay four years ago, and since then the model has spread to other areas. Locals said the homestay greatly promotes traditional dishes, preserves local culture, and observes natural beauty.Patmara village is a gateway to the popular Rara Lake. Trekkers visiting Rara Lake often go to Patmara. After opening the community homestay, the model has also been replicated in other areas.According to operators, a homestay normally earns Rs300,000 to Rs400,000 a year.Rawat said that since homestays are new to Jumla, they usually hold monthly meetings to discuss improvements in hospitality. Facilities and services are reviewed, and they address complaints made by tourists to improve the experience.The community homestay in Patmara started four years ago, and the community has held more than 100 meetings. Before operating the homestay, the women visited Pokhara and Ghale Gaun, a popular scenic tourist destination in Lamjung, where homestays are popular.Kalashi Budha, secretary of the community homestay, said many homestays focus on decoration. “But here, natural beauty is enough to attract tourists.”During the monsoon, tourists can enjoy the green highland pastures. In winter, they are mesmerised when they see the pasture covered in snow. “The view and traditional food make tourists happy,” said Budha.Initially, the women took out loans of Rs 100,000 to start the homestay, and now they invest from their earnings. Women are also financially independent and support others by providing loans at low interest rates.Rawat said women used to ask for money in their homes to run the family, but now they take care of their children's and husbands' expenses.Rawat's husband, Nara Bahadur, has been in Saudi Arabia for the last two years. Before that he worked for five years in Malaysia. His income has also been invested in homestay.Alcohol is prohibited in the homestay.The homestay offers buckwheat, wheat, and barley dishes, including bread, cake, lentils, beans, and marsi rice. Tourist favourites are chicken, marsi rice, and potato dishes.Food is prepared according to the tourists' preferences. Tourists also admire boiled local potatoes and local potato chips.Other villages have also started operating homestays and welcoming guests.According to Budha, more than 1,000 tourists from Australia, the US, France, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan have stayed in the Patmara homestay. Women have kept a list of tourists.“With the arrival of tourists after homestays were opened, sanitation in the villages has improved,” said Budha.“Most of the tourists arrive by making phone contact, while some arrive after visiting Rara Lake,” said Budha.Women operating homestays also have other roles. Once a month, they monitor the community forest to control illegal wildlife and herb trade. They are particularly concerned about the conservation of red pandas as most tourists come to see these shy animals.Conservation efforts are underway to save red pandas, and Maharudra Community Forest has been designated as a pocket area for their protection.The Red Panda Network, Kathmandu, and Hatemalo Nepal have been helping to manage and operate homestays.Hoarding boards have been placed in community homestays to promote the red panda.Patmara is located just beyond Urthuchautara, on the way from Khalanga. Tourists use the shortest route to reach Rara Lake, so 10-25 vehicles arrive daily. In 2011, the government announced the Nepal Tourism Year, which set off the homestay trend in the country in anticipation of a surge in tourist arrivals.Homestay was conceived as an alternative arrangement for an expected hotel room shortage during the tourism campaign, which aimed to attract one million tourists.Homestays then became a permanent feature of Nepali tourism. Hundreds of homestays started to pop up across the country. The government gave homestays legal status by drafting a regulation. Homestays became a success.However, many individuals and community homestays folded due to the Covid pandemic.The history of homestays in Nepal dates back to 1980, when the late Captain Rudra Man Gurung opened the first homestay in Nepal, Sirubari Homestay Retreat, which was a new kind of hospitality service in the country.Located in a hill village in Syangja southwest of Pokhara, the homestay started by the former Indian Army officer put Sirubari on Nepal's tourism map, and it became a popular village tourism destination. \nThe Health Foundation Nepal (HFN), a non-profit established in 2013 by Nepali doctors in the United States, hosted its 12th annual conference on December 7 in Greensboro, North Carolina.Committed to improving healthcare for underserved communities in Nepal, HFN has been instrumental in addressing disparities in community and mental health and combating non-communicable diseases through its programmes in the Dang and Chitwan districts.One of its notable initiatives, Khushi Ba Ama, provides comprehensive support to senior citizens over 60, addressing both their healthcare and social needs.During the Annual Scientific Meeting, Dr. Shreedhar Paudel, HFN’s chairperson, underscored the organisation's achievements and outlined plans to expand collaborations with the Nepali government and other stakeholders to enhance healthcare initiatives.The conference also featured discussions on global and mental health advancements, with presentations covering topics such as cultural competence in mental health care and the prevalence of depression among Nepali medical students, reflecting HFN’s decade-long impact. \nNepal has banned additional three hazardous pesticides—paraquat dichloride, chlorpyrifos and phorate—which are not only being used to kill pests but are also being misused for suicide.“The Pesticide Management Committee has decided to prohibit the production, synthesis, export, import, transport, commercial use, storage, and sale of the said pesticides in the country,” reads the order published in the Nepal Gazette on Thursday.Poison ingestion, mostly involving pesticides, is the second leading cause of suicide in Nepal after hanging. According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 952 people killed themselves by consuming poison in the fiscal year 2023-24. “Poison is easily available in every household in rural areas across the country, as farmers often keep it in the house to use in crops,” said Dr Dilli Ram Sharma, former director general at the Department of Agriculture. “These hazardous substances are easily available in agri-veterinary shops and are not only being used in plants but also for suicide in our country.”Earlier, in 2018, the country banned eight pesticides—carbofuran, dichlorvos, triazophos, carbaryl, benomyl, carbosulfan, dicofol, and aluminum phosphide. Following the ban, suicides by poison ingestion have dramatically declined, according to Nepal Police report.Police data show that 1,320 people died by poison ingestion in 2018-19, the year authorities banned eight pesticides commonly used for suicide. The numbers dropped to 1,136 in 2019-20; 1,276 in 2020-21; 1040 in 2021-22 and 932 in 2022-23. Sharma said that traders can sell their existing stock of banned poisonous substances for up to two years, but cannot import more.“These pesticides are so hazardous that they can cause cancer, paralysis, renal failure, heart diseases in children, and deformities in newborn babies if used for a long time,” said Sharma. “Many countries, including India, have banned these pesticides.”After the ban on aluminium phosphide in 2018, people in crisis began ingesting chlorpyrifos, which is widely available on the market. Studies show that banning highly hazardous pesticides is a cost-effective and affordable intervention to reduce suicide rates. Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates. The country witnessed an alarming rise in suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year. “Restricting access to commonly used hazardous pesticides will help reduce deaths from suicides,” said Dr Rakesh Ghimire, principal investigator of Nepal for the Center for Pesticide Suicide Prevention at the University of Edinburgh of the United Kingdom, which has been carrying out research on suicides by poison ingestion in Nepal. “Many people who are in a moment of crisis can change their minds if they do not have access to poisonous substances.”Studies show that a ban on a few highly hazardous pesticides in Bangladesh, South Korea, and Sri Lanka, among others, led to sharp reductions in overall suicide rates. Pesticides are commonly used to get rid of insects, fungi, weeds and diseases which damage plants and crops. Every year more than 1,300 metric tons of 135 types of pesticides, including insecticide, fungicide, herbicide and biopesticide, are brought into Nepal, according to the Plant Protection Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.Doctors say high levels of pesticides in fruits and vegetables cause nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dizziness and anxiety. Long-term consumption of fruits and vegetables with high levels of pesticides can lead to kidney failure, lung disease and mental health problems, and can even cause cancer. According to health experts, the consumption of such fruits and vegetables may also affect pregnant women and harm the foetus. \nNearly 30 percent of doctors who completed their master’s degree and sat a recent licensing test of the Nepal Medical Council failed to score the pass mark.According to the council, the national regulatory body of medical doctors, only 175 out of 275 doctors who appeared for the exam passed the licensing test held on Thursday.“Only those who secure the pass mark become specialist doctors,” said Dr Chop Lal Bhusal, chairman of the council. “Those who fail the licensing test have to retake the exam.”The council conducts the licensing test for postgraduate doctors every four months. Those who fail can retake the exam until they pass.This is not the first time such a large number of doctors have failed to secure the minimum pass mark needed to practise as consultant doctors. Officials at the council said the average pass percentage for postgraduate doctors is around 70.“Only 50 to 55 percent of doctors with an MBBS degree pass the licensing test, while around 70 percent of postgraduate doctors pass,” said Bhusal. “What is worrying is a lot of doctors with master’s degrees are failing to secure even the pass marks.”To qualify as a medical practitioner, a doctor must secure at least 50 percent in the licensing exam. Experts say the quality of medical education is being compromised by underachievers who do not deserve to practise medicine entering the profession. “Universities and colleges must pay closer attention to the results of the doctors they produce,” said Bhusal. Licensing tests for medical doctors are a routine procedure in every country. Nepal’s licensing test focuses only on doctors’ knowledge. Some countries also conduct skill tests. Council officials said they had also planned to conduct skill tests in the past, but could not due to the lack of skill labs.“Only the National Academy of Medical Sciences;, Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine; and Kathmandu University’s Dhulikhel Hospital have skill labs,” said Dr Krishna Prasad Adhikari, former registrar of the Council. “We had planned to set up skill labs with support from various agencies, including the World Health Organisation, but things didn’t go as planned.”The World Health Organisation said inaccurate diagnosis, medical errors, inappropriate or unnecessary treatment, inadequate or unsafe clinical facilities and practices, and healthcare providers who lack adequate training and expertise are present in all countries. The UN health body says low-quality health care is increasing the burden of illness and health costs globally. \nThe Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, which has been running a human milk bank, is now providing breast milk to vulnerable infants born in other hospitals.Doctors at the hospital said the purpose of the milk bank is to save infants' lives, regardless of where they are born.“Human breast milk is required for vulnerable infants—those whose mothers died during or after giving birth, critically ill newborns in neonatal intensive care units, premature babies with low birth weights,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, director at the hospital. “We have been supplying breast milk to such infants in other hospitals, including Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Patan Hospital, Norvic Hospital, and B&B Hospital, among others.”The human milk bank, launched some two years ago at the hospital, aims to reduce neonatal deaths, which remains constantly high. Since 2016, neonatal deaths have not declined, despite various measures implemented by health authorities.According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births.Doctors say feeding low-weight babies and critically ill neonates in intensive care units can significantly reduce the risk of infections. The bank collects, tests, pasteurises and stores donor milk from lactating mothers.“The milk is collected mostly from the mothers of ailing babies, who cannot breastfeed their infants admitted to the intensive care units,” said Dr Sailendra Bir Karmacharya, a senior consultant paediatrician of the hospital. “We provide milk only to infants weighing less than 1,000 grams.”According to doctors, human breast milk contains the best source of nutrition and ensures the survival and healthy growth of babies. It bolsters brain development and has lifelong benefits for both the baby and the mother.Karmacharya said that human milk helps in reducing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal problem that mostly affects premature babies. Officials said the hospital needs 1.5 to 2.5 litres of breast milk for babies admitted to the intensive care unit. The human milk bank collects milk directly from mothers of hospitalised babies, but it collects only surplus milk from other lactating mothers, which is then tested, pasteurised and stored at minus 40 degrees Celsius. The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. The 16th five-year periodic plan, which ends in 2029, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from 21 per 1,000 live births. The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes, including hiring staff nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding has the potential to prevent 13 percent of under-five deaths. Studies show that Nepal's exclusive breastfeeding rate has steadily declined over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022, exclusive breastfeeding dropped consistently from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It stated that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), compared to 12 percent of those born at home.Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is prone to contamination and increases the risk of diseases in children, according to the World Health Organisation.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to breastfeed their babies, as studies show. The report shows that the proportion of children who are bottle-fed increases with mothers’ education, rising from 12 percent among children of mothers with no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Bottle-feeding is most common in the highest wealth quintile—46 percent—and least common in the lowest wealth quintile—11 percent.Among the seven provinces of Nepal, exclusive breastfeeding rates are the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest at 11 percent in Karnali Province, 12 percent in Madhesh Province and the highest at 43 percent in Bagmati Province.Doctors recommend breastfeeding for the first two years of a baby’s life or longer, as breast milk lowers the risk of illness in children, promotes their recovery during illness, and provides important nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nEminent city doctors and health experts today gave a call for caution, mass awareness and improved government policies to minimise the use of microplastics that can cause several health hazards, including cancer.Tiny plastic particles that are less than 5 mm are called microplastics and are being attributed to severe respiratory diseases or even some types of cancer. According to Dr Monidipa Mondal, an eminent radiation oncologist, when microplastics enter the body through food or other sources, they first encounter the immune cells. “Being micro-mini in size, they can easily enter the immune cells after which a biochemical agent called cyclophane is released. The cyclophanes prepare chronic information inside the cells. “As we know if chronic information continues to get stored in the cells, it can lead to cancer. Apart from this, cancer is also related to free radicals. Therefore, it also creates oxidative stress in the cells and free radicals in the cells due to which cell multiplication occurs,” informed the doctor.As reiterated by Dr Mondal, recent studies have revealed an increased number of colorectal cancers among people. “It has been found in some studies that microplastics could be a possible driver of colorectal cancer. Another observation reveals a link between breast cancer and microplastic. We have also heard about BPA-free plastic. BPA or Bisphenol-A is an agent that can mimic estrogen. In some cancer cases, estrogen has been found. It can, therefore, be said that if it can mimic estrogen, it could also be a possible cause of breast cancer,” she added.According to research by India Clean Air Network (India CAN), degraded plastic from waste and wastewater discharge due to inefficient treatment processes are two of the major sources of microplastics in West Bengal entering the human body in various ways. The health experts recommended stronger and improved government policies to curb the menace of plastic. As pointed out by Professor Sadhan K Ghosh, mass awareness, particularly among young students is the need of the hour. “The first need is waste segregation. Second, the governance should be such that microplastics are not created for which legislation and its implementation must be done. Also, as plastic becomes brittle and enters our body while swimming or is even consumed by fish that we eat, littering sea beaches should be prohibited,” pointed out the professor.-In Association with ANN \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nKarnali Yaks registered a five-run win against Lumbini Lions in the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL) at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Friday.Batting first, Karnali set the target of 129 runs. Karnali’s Will Bosisto contributed the most runs 45 off 30 balls, Arjun Bitalu chipped in with 25 runs, opener Babar Hayat made 20 runs while Chadwick Walton made 15 runs. Lions bowler Vikash Agri took the major 3 wickets and Tilak Bhandari took two wickets, while Ramon Simmonds, Saad Zafar and Rohit Paudel took up one piece. Chasing a target of 129 runs, Lumbini managed to gather 123 runs at the loss of 7 wickets in 20 overs. Tom Moores and Sundeep Jora with a partnership of 51 runs raised the run score, but the Lions were not able to chase down the target. Lions’ batters were bowled out with Ashutosh Ghiraiya at 16 runs off 21 balls, Arjun Saud (13), Rohit Paudel (10), Ben Cutting (1), Tilak Bhandari (3*), Ramon Simmonds (4*). Saad Zafar was run out at 16.Yaks’ Zeeshan Maqsood took two wickets. Sompal Kami, Nandan Yadav, Bipin Sharma and Will Bosisto took a single wicket each.  \nAs Donald Trump steps up his tariff threats against China, Beijing is moving to beat the next US president to the punch with its own restrictions and get Washington to the negotiating table ahead of a full-blown trade war, analysts say.Armed with the lessons of the last trade war during Trump’s first term, China is seeking to amass bargaining chips to kick off talks with a new US administration on contentious aspects of bilateral ties, including trade and investment, and science and technology. It is also concerned about the harmful effects of additional tariffs on its already fragile economy.This week, China launched a probe into US chip giant Nvidia (NVDA.O) over what it claimed were suspected antitrust violations, which follows its ban on US-bound exports of rare minerals.“We have to look at this as the opening bid in what will likely ultimately turn into a negotiation with the US rather than just an imposition of tariffs and everyone walks away,” HSBC’s Chief Asia Economist Fred Neumann said.China is better prepared to deal with almost any tariffs, short of an “Armageddon announcement” of a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, said George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre.The world’s second-largest economy now globally dominates sectors such as electric vehicles and green energy, and has less need for the Boeing jets and large gasoline-fuelled cars it bought back in 2017, having found substitutes such as Airbus airplanes and its own Comac C919.But China is far from self-sufficient.A new trade war with the world’s biggest economy would still hurt China more, analysts say, as Washington can levy ever-larger import duties on its goods and further rip China from its supply chains.China still needs to import strategic materials from the US such as advanced microchips and other high-tech equipment and counts on US consumers to buy its goods, given an increasingly pessimistic global trade outlook and weak domestic consumer demand.Beijing wants to sit down with Trump before he places more curbs on US high-tech exports and to secure the renewal of the US-China Science and Technology Agreement, said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific at Natixis.The agreement, which enables scientific collaboration between the two countries, lapsed in August and negotiations over its renewal are unlikely to be completed before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.While China’s Huawei (HWT.UL) has heavily invested in its advanced chip-making capabilities, their commercial viability remains unclear, she added, incentivising China’s negotiators to sit down with their US counterparts to strike a deal ensuring a steady supply of American-made chips.Art of the dealBeijing took two years before it agreed to buy an extra $200 billion in American goods and services, per the terms of the “Phase One” agreement which ended the first trade war.This time, China has new carrots to dangle, such as increasing purchases of oil and liquefied natural gas, as the US is currently pumping out more than it can consume.“Trump bragged on the campaign trail: ‘Drill baby, drill,’ so (he) will need the demand support,” said Bo Zhengyuan, a Shanghai-based partner at consultancy Plenum.Given the increasing restrictions on the export of chips, agricultural goods, commodities and energy are among the items the US can still sell to China, Bo said.China’s commerce ministry said it was open to engaging and communicating with the economic and trade teams of the Trump administration, when asked for comment.But Beijing also has sticks to beat Washington with, if the US side feels China’s failure to meet its previous purchase commitments means it will gain more from tariffs than talks.US firms are already feeling the squeeze, said Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.“US companies and other foreign companies have really been concerned about whether they actually have access to this market,” Hart said. “Can we even sell into China anymore? Is there an outright ban on us?”Business sentiment among US firms in China is at its lowest since 1999, according to a September survey by the American Chamber’s Shanghai chapter.There are also non-economic factors at play. Trump has pledged additional tariffs of 10% on Chinese goods to push Beijing to do more to stop fentanyl flows into the US“Using political justifications for the imposition of trade restrictions ultimately makes the tensions much more intractable,” said HSBC’s Neumann.The fentanyl tariffs also mirror China’s import curbs on trading partners that displease Beijing over issues such as human rights, Taiwan and the South China Sea.“It’s taking a leaf out of China’s manual of coercion,” Magnus said. “I think they would see it as a slap in the face.” \nAn Israeli strike killed at least 30 Palestinians and wounded 50 others who were sheltering in a post office in central Gaza Strip, bringing the death toll on Thursday in the enclave to 66.With no sign of let-up in the 14-month-old conflict, the strike hit a postal facility in Nuseirat camp where displaced families had sought refuge and also damaged several nearby houses, medics told Reuters.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Nuseirat is one of the Gaza Strip’s eight historic camps originally for Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war around the establishment of Israel. Today, it is part of a dense urban area crowded with displaced people from throughout the enclave.Earlier on Thursday, two Israeli strikes in southern Gaza killed 13 Palestinians who Gaza medics and Hamas said were part of a force protecting humanitarian aid trucks. Israel’s military said they were Hamas militants trying to hijack the shipment.Many of those killed in the attacks on Rafah and Khan Younis had links to Hamas, according to sources close to the group.The Israeli military said in a statement the two airstrikes aimed to ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and accused Hamas members of planning to prevent the aid from reaching Gaza civilians who need it.The statement said the Hamas members aimed to hijack the aid “in support of continuing terrorist activity”.Armed gangs have repeatedly hijacked aid trucks, and Hamas has formed a task force to confront them. The Hamas-led forces have killed over two dozen members of the gangs in recent months, Hamas sources and medics said.Hamas said Israeli military strikes have killed at least 700 police tasked with securing aid trucks in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. It has accused Israel of trying to protect looting and “creating anarchy and chaos to prevent aid from reaching the people of Gaza”.Separately, the Israeli military on Thursday ordered residents of several districts in the heart of Gaza City to evacuate, saying it would respond to rockets launched from those areas.“This is a pre-warning before an attack,” read a military statement posted on X that some residents also received as text and audio alerts on their mobile phones.The evacuation orders caused a new wave of displacement. At nightfall, dozens of families streamed out of the areas heading toward the centre of the city.ISRAELI STRIKES IN GAZA CITY, CENTRAL GAZAIsraeli bombings of a residential building in Gaza City’s al-Jalaa Street and a house west of Nuseirat killed 22 people, medics and the Palestinian news agency WAFA said.In the northern Gaza refugee camp of Jabalia, where the army has operated since October, health officials said an orthopaedic doctor, Saeed Judeh, was shot dead by Israeli forces while on his way to Al-Awda Hospital where he usually treated patients.The health ministry said his death raised to 1,057 the number of healthcare workers killed since the war began.Months of ceasefire efforts by Arab mediators, Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, have failed to conclude a deal between the two warring sides.On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to demand an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire and the immediate release of all hostages seized in Israel in October 2023 and held by Hamas in Gaza.The war in the Palestinian enclave began after Hamas gunmen stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages back to Hamas-run Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.Since then, Israel’s military has levelled swathes of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 44,800 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. \nOutgoing US President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was pardoning 39 people convicted of non-violent crimes and commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 others who were serving long prison terms.The moves come over a week after the president signed an unconditional pardon for his son Hunter.Officials said last week that the White House was listening to demands for Biden to extend the same grace to thousands of people wronged by the US judicial system.Biden said the people he granted clemency would have received shorter sentences if charged under today’s laws, policies and practices.Sources had told Reuters last week that the pardons being discussed included those convicted of nonviolent drug offenses and people identified by civil rights groups as unjustly incarcerated.“As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses,” Biden said.The president added that he will take more steps in the weeks ahead and that his administration will continue reviewing clemency petitions.The commutations announced were for those who were placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate the spread of the virus, experts say, rather than many individuals civil rights groups have been advocating for.“We want Biden to look at those people and consider using his power even more in the upcoming weeks,” said Tierra Bradford, senior program manager at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.US Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, one of the leading Democrats behind a letter to Biden last month urging him to issue clemency to Americans with nonviolent offenses, commended the president for taking “meaningful and historic action.”Her statement noted that he could take further steps to exercise his power during his remaining 39 days in office.The White House said the clemencies granted by Biden were the most ever in a single day.“The president takes this very, very seriously, and is going to review all options, especially ... the clemency petitions,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on January 20, has said he would act on his first day in office to pardon rioters involved in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, further building expectations for a broad granting of clemency. \nA Pakistani court indicted imprisoned former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife on fresh charges of illegally selling state gifts on Thursday, local broadcaster Geo reported.The indictment was the latest in dozens of cases against the 72-year-old former cricket star, who has been in jail since late last year.Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have already been granted bail in the case, which is one of a series of state treasury charges known as “Toshakhana”.These charges revolve around allegations that Khan and his wife illegally procured and then sold gifts worth more than 140 million rupees ($501,000) in state possession, which he received during his 2018-22 premiership. They have denied committing an offence.Khan and Bibi were both handed a 14-year sentence on those charges days before a national election earlier this year, following a three-year sentence handed to him in late 2023 in another version of the same case.However, their sentences have been suspended in appeals at the high court.The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes - the most expensive being valued at 85 million rupees ($305,000).Earlier this month, Khan was also indicted on charges of inciting attacks against the military, a case stemming from deadly anti-government rallies led by his party last year.Bibi also led a deadly protest march by thousands of supporters in the capital Islamabad on Nov. 25, escalating a face-off with the government and its military backers.Khan has been fighting court cases since he was ousted from power in 2022. He and his party say the cases were made up to keep him out of politics at the behest of the military after he had fallen out with the army's generals. The army denies the accusation. \nKite-flying, a cultural tradition in Kathmandu Valley, began with the arrival of Newar traders carrying the skill from Tibet or China. During Dashain, kites soared and fought in the skies, with spectators cheering and children collecting fallen ones. Kite fighters used special threads to cut opponents' lines, creating a sharp \"chaitt\" sound. The season officially ended with a fair at Budhanilakantha Temple, where King Tribhuvan sometimes participated in kite competitions. However, urbanization and modern entertainment have led to the decline of kite-flying in Kathmandu.\nFrom 2008 to 2017, Matina Shakya served as the Kumari of Kathmandu, venerated as a divine goddess in Hindu-Buddhist tradition, while her reign ended with menstruation, paving the way for Trishna Shakya's succession.\nJuddha Shumsher Rana's Jawalakhel Zoological Garden featured exotic animals like tigers, rhinos, leopards, elephants, deer, birds, and even a lion, with the zoo officially opening to the public in 1956 after becoming a government property in 1951.\nMSMEs, employing 85% of Nepal's workforce, face a $3.56 billion financing gap due to inadequate banking structures. The Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) aims to bridge this gap by mitigating risk, enabling access to credit, and supporting growth sectors.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) chatbots provide companionship and therapeutic support, addressing loneliness and mental health challenges, but raise concerns about data manipulation, potential misinformation, and reduced human interaction.\nNepal's planning and budgeting adhere to constitutional provisions, empowering federal, provincial and local governments to operate within their jurisdictions, estimated resources form the basis for MTEF and annual budgets, with the National Planning Commission playing a crucial role; however, challenges include oversight, compliance, allocation misalignments and fiscal dependency of subnational governments.\nStudents in quake-damaged schools in Karnali endure dangerous conditions a year after the earthquake, despite recent reconstruction initiatives.\nIn August this year, the three major parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—joined hands to pass the long-stuck bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act-2014. Their action was widely hailed as a big milestone in Nepal’s transitional justice process. But now, when time has come to pick the candidates for the two important transitional justice bodies—the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP)—which have been without office-bearers since 2022, the parties are faltering. The names shortlisted as potential office-bearers of these commissions have sparked controversy, with conflict victims accusing the parties of overlooking their concerns.These commissions’ role in concluding Nepal’s peace process is pivotal. The CIEDP was formed to find the whereabouts of the disappeared persons, recommend reparation to victims and prosecute the accused related to the armed conflict. Similarly, the TRC is there to investigate serious human rights violations, identify those involved and recommend reparative and legal measures. It also envisioned reconciliation, mutual goodwill and peace between perpetrators and victims. Yet, they have fallen woefully short of the expectations of both victims and rights activists. Due to a lack of competence and constant political meddling, they haven’t progressed beyond collecting complaints and conducting initial investigations in a handful of cases. This is the third time the government is appointing officials to these commissions. Still, past mistakes in the selection of office-bearers are being repeated, as a recommendation committee has been formed under the leadership of a person who botched the same job in 2020. The chairpersons and members of the two commissions nominated under him had failed to perform their duties. The names shortlisted this time have also disappointed rights activists and victims alike. Despite their repeated calls to select the commissions’ leaderships through a consultative, transparent and inclusive process, their concerns went unheeded. The list, in the eyes of rights activists and victims, prioritises controversial figures over competent and deserving ones. This leaves one wondering if the parties had a hidden agenda behind the August agreement, as it seems partisan interests have again prevailed over national healing. The politicisation and manipulation of these commissions’ selection processes will not ensure justice for the victims of the insurgency. When the parties united to conclude the process back in August, the international community had immediately welcomed the move, but the new controversy over the shortlisted names again risks discrediting the whole process, both at home and abroad. What’s more concerning is that the National Human Rights Commission, which should have acted as a watchdog in the process, is silent, perhaps because one NHRC commissioner is a member of the recommendation panel. The rights watchdog’s complicity will further erode its public trust. Justice delayed has already become justice denied for many conflict victims. For the transitional justice process to come to a successful end, top political leaders and parties must rise above petty interests and acknowledge long-term damage their misjudgement can inflict on the conflict victims who have now waited for justice for nearly two decades since the guns fell silent in 2006. If these commissions again fail in their responsibilities, it will be seen as a sign of the failure of the democratic process in the country. Nepal needs competent people in the two commissions, those with unwavering integrity and commitment to justice. We have ample evidence now that compromised transitional justice bodies cannot work in the interest of victims.   \nProvincial assembly parliamentary committees are pivotal to strengthening federalism in Nepal. These committees work to hold provincial governments accountable. Even when the assembly is not in session, the committees can continue working. As the provincial assemblies cannot manage all the tasks, these committees, with various thematic jurisdiction and expertise, work by often rising above partisan interest to save the parliament’s time; they simplify work and conduct various studies. Article 193 of the Constitution of Nepal specifies that “the State Assembly may, as per its rules, form committees or special committees, as required, to manage its working procedures”. Thus, the number of thematic areas varies in each province. However, the functioning of these committees is undermined in several provinces. In Karnali, three of the four parliamentary committees—the Finance and Natural Resources Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Social Development Committee—are currently without heads. While the first committee has had no chief since April this year, the latter two have been vacant for three months. The prolonged leadership vacuum in important committees is also something that is routinely seen in other provinces. The five committees in Bagmati were at a standstill without chairpersons for more than a year since the first session of the start of the second term of the Bagmati Provincial Assembly in January 2023. The parliamentary committees in Lumbini and Sudurpaschim have been without their chairs after the formation of their respective assemblies last year. The absence of chiefs of these key provincial assembly parliamentary committees makes it difficult to hold the provincial governments accountable. These governments fail on governance, budget implementation and role assignment to the provincial assemblies. Passage of essential bills is also hampered. Four critical bills are stuck in various committees in Karnali. Meetings to facilitate dialogue between assembly members and ministers are yet to be convened. Moreover, the provincial government, taking advantage of the committee’s ineffectiveness and lack of monitoring, has been working arbitrarily, bypassing essential checks and balances.This in turn has added to the woes of Karnali, a geographically remote and severely underdeveloped region in western Nepal. The inactivity of the Social Development Committee is particularly concerning in a province where basic social indicators, such as health and literacy, lag far behind the national average. As the committee also deals with ministries of land management, agriculture and cooperatives, labour and social justice and human rights commission, works related to these areas are also affected. Despite the province’s rich natural resources, their potential remains untapped. Lack of development activities, particularly road-related infrastructure, has affected the province’s tourism prospects. The inactivity of the Finance and Natural Resources Committee is, therefore, troubling. More worryingly, another leaderless committee—Public Accounts—which oversees the financial discipline of the province, could fail to monitor corruption activities.Provincial governments were envisioned as significant drivers of localised development and accountability, but they have often become battlegrounds for political manoeuvring. Because of this, appointments for the leadership positions in these committees, as has happened in Bagmati in the past, have been deliberately delayed by the political parties. Even though Karnali’s assembly regulations allow the eldest member of the assembly committee to act as an interim chief, this provision has not been invoked. The political parties would do well to appoint the chairs immediately to stop the erosion of public trust in provincial governments—unless that is precisely their intent.    \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nOn Friday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy to mainly fair throughout the country.Tonight the weather will remain partly cloudy to mainly fair throughout the country.On Thursday Janakpur experienced a maximum temperature of 27.6°C, while Jumla registered a minimum temperature of -6.2°C.
