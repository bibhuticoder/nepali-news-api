In the story cover all the events as much as possible, try to weave them together, making a beautiful story.\n    Be elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings. Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNearly 1.5 million customers still don’t know why they have lost access to six dozen TV channels for the past two weeks, even though they have paid for them in advance.The channel distributors have blamed the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology for not recommending the foreign exchange facility to the Nepal Rastra Bank, while the ministry says no distributors have applied for it.Seventy-two channels under Sony, Star, Zee, and iCast banners have been off the air since August 1.The ministry said that the Nepali channel distributors hadn’t paid the Indian broadcaster for a year and a half, and the dues could amount to Rs1 billion. As a result, the Indian broadcaster has stopped channel distribution to Nepal.However, the Nepali channel distributors have raised all the money from Nepali customers in advance, and consumer rights activists say they have to compensate.Sudip Acharya, managing director of Dish Media Network, the operator of DishHome, a DTH and internet service provider in Nepal, said they had paid the Nepali distributors in advance after raising money from customers.“Now, we are under pressure from the customers. We are asking the distributors to return our payment.”An official of WorldLink Communications, Nepal’s largest internet service provider, said the issue could not be solved during the tenure of former communication minister Rekha Sharma and there are no signs of a solution anytime soon.There are seven local distributors. NETTV, one of the operators with 1.3 million customers, posted a message on its website: “Due to unexpected reasons, Indian Premium and International channels are currently deactivated, and they will be resumed soon. We will inform you as soon as the channels are restored.”Manish Singh, CEO of DMB Holdings, distributor of Star and Zee networks, said they had sent the details of the bill to the ministry in June, which includes recommendations for the foreign exchange facility from October 2023 to June 2024. “We don’t know why the ministry is dithering,” Singh said. “I have been making rounds at the ministry, but the officials are confused even though we have made full compliance with the à la carte system. The government imposed the rules in haste, and it is itself in a dilemma now,” he added. Most distributors, government officials, and internet service providers say that service will resume soon, but no one knows when. One official told the Post that the problem could linger. “We are in the process of solving the issue,” said Subodh Nepal, director of the Department of Information and Broadcasting. Even though the à la carte system, which allows viewers to pick the channels they want to watch and only pay for them, was implemented a year ago, Nepal said it took time for operators and broadcasters to fully implement it. Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation, a unified representative body of TV broadcasters and over-the-top platforms in India, cut the channel service in Nepal on August 1 due to non-payment of service dues.Nepal said there had been a dispute over payment between the government and broadcasters before as well as after the implementation of the à la carte system. The service providers usually apply to the department for payment, and the ministry recommends the foreign exchange facility.Officials said the local distributors created the problem, and they are not showing any interest in clearing the dues, as barely one or two distributors have come for the recommendation.The ministry has formed an informal committee to look into the issue and determine the exact dues that the distributors must pay.Gajendra Kumar Thakur, spokesperson for the communication ministry, said that despite collecting advance payments from customers, the distributors have not paid the broadcaster for over a year.“We will recommend the payment for any distributor who applies for the payment to the broadcaster,” Thakur said.In August last year, the communication ministry formally implemented the “pick-and-pay” option for Nepali television viewers. This allows viewers to watch their favourite channels and pay only for those rather than the whole package that includes channels they rarely watch. To cover carrying costs, the ministry of communications has fixed a minimum monthly fee of Rs250 per customer for cable television.It used to cost a customer around Rs1,000 a month to subscribe to the channels, but with the implementation of the à la carte system, it will cost no more than Rs470 a month even if the customer subscribes to all the channels, Thakur said.A total of 32 channels are broadcast under Star India, 21 under Sony Pictures, 15 under Indiacast Media Distribution, 10 under ZEE Entertainment, 14 under Discovery Network Asia Pacific, 5 under HBO, 1 under BBC Studio Distribution and 2 under channels under Bennet Coleman and Company.The cable operators can customise channels under the à la carte system and submit them for approval.Currently, TV channels are broadcast in Nepal through direct-to-home, multiple-system operators, multichannel multipoint distribution services, internet protocol television, and digital terrestrial television, among other methods.Consumer rights activists say that collecting payment in advance and depriving people of services is cheating and against the law.  \nIn Nepal on a ‘familiarisation’ visit, new Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had a hectic first day in Kathmandu. He paid a courtesy call on President Ramchandra Paudel on Sunday. During the meeting at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Sheetal Niwas, a number of topics related to bilateral relations and mutual interest were discussed.During the meeting, President Paudel stated that Nepal and India have to cooperate to minimise the effects of climate change.“Both countries must work together to reduce the effects of climate change since the safety of mankind depends on the safety of mountains and water,” Kiran Pokharel, the President’s press adviser, told the Post, quoting Paudel. President Paudel also said that Nepal and India have had a relationship from the time immemorial and acknowledged India’s big contribution to Nepal’s development. President Paudel mentioned that there is a lot of potential for hydropower development, sustainable and easy energy trade in Nepal.On the occasion, Indian Foreign Secretary Misri expressed his commitment to working together with Nepal as the issue of reducing the impact of climate change is a challenge for both the countries, says Pokharel.Quoting Misri, Pokharel further said, “Among the plans of the Nepal government, India would like to work on Nepal’s priorities such as energy, agriculture and tourism.”The visiting Indian foreign secretary also paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Sunday at Singha Durbar. During their meeting various matters of mutual interest were discussed, says the foreign ministry of Nepal. A source at the Prime Minister’s Office said that during the meeting Prime Minister Oli strongly urged that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi should soon visit Nepal. He also extended a formal invitation. Earlier, Indian Prime Minister Modi was expected to come to Nepal on one of the Mondays of Shawan to pay homage to Lord Pashupatinath. But that window closes in five days.During his first and second tenures, Indian Prime Minister Modi visited Nepal five times in total. After the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition got the majority in the 14th Lok Sabha election in June, Modi was appointed the prime minister of India for the third time. While Modi first became the prime minister in 2014, Oli became the prime minister of Nepal in 2015. During the second tenure of Modi, which started in 2019, Oli was against the prime minister, following the 2017 elections. Relations between the two countries are at present considered to be at a low, according to experts.Earlier in 2018, Indian Prime Minister Modi had visited Nepal at the invitation of Oli the prime minister.This is a familiarisation visit of Secretary Misri, said spokesperson for the foreign ministry in Kathmandu Amrit Rai. “Therefore, no issues other than those of bilateral interest were discussed.”However, Rai refused to categorically mention the issues of mutual interest. Oli, who became prime minister on July 12, will be in Thailand as his first foreign trip after being appointed the prime minister. He is scheduled to attend the sixth summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) starting September 4.Nepal and Thailand are also working to make Prime Minister Oli’s visit bilateral. After Thailand, Prime Minister Oli will take part in the 79th session of the United National General Assembly in September. The Prime Minister’s Office claimed that both India and China had invited Prime Minister Oli. Indian Foreign Secretary Misri, apart from President Paudel and Prime Minister Oli, also met Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba at his residence in Budhanilkantha. Among other things, they discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations, according to a press release issued after the meeting.Also on Sunday Misri also paid a courtesy call on CPN (Maoist Centre) chair and former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. During the meeting both sides discussed issues of mutual interest, said Dahal’s personal secretary Ramesh Malla.“Since it was an introductory visit, the discussion was casual,” Malla told the Post. The visiting foreign secretary reportedly vowed to work on the agreement reached between the two countries when Dahal was the prime minister.When Dahal visited India as the prime minister of Nepal in June 2023, India had agreed to import 10,000 MW of hydroelectricity from Nepal.Indian Secretary Misri came to Kathmandu on a two-day visit at the invitation of Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal. Misri was welcomed by his Nepali counterpart Lamsal at the Tribhuvan International Airport.Misri took up his new role last month, succeeding Vinay Mohan Kwatra, who served as Indian ambassador to Nepal from March 2020 to April 2022. Misri undertook his first familiarisation visit, to Bhutan, on July 18.Foreign ministry officials said that it is customary for new foreign secretaries to tour South Asian countries after assuming office to update themselves and assess bilateral relations. Before being promoted to Indian foreign secretary, Misri served as deputy national security adviser of India.The 59-year-old has a distinguished career, having served as private secretary to three prime ministers—Inder Kumar Gujral in 1997, Manmohan Singh in 2012, and Narendra Modi in 2014.Known as a China expert within the Indian foreign policy establishment, Misri was India’s ambassador to China (2019-2021) and played a key role in India-China negotiations following the 2020 Galwan Valley clashes that resulted from the actions of the Chinese military in eastern Ladakh.Misri also inaugurated the new building of the Nepal Bhasha Parishad in Kathmandu. The building, located in Naradevi, was built with the assistance from India’s post-earthquake reconstruction grant. After an introductory meeting with Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba on Monday, Misri will return to India. \nAt the Dhulikhel Hospital in Kavrepalanchok, the suggestion box is overflowing with complaints of rude behaviour.People are unhappy not only with doctors, nurses and paramedics serving at the hospital, but also with security guards, administrative staff and those manning the hospital’s ticket counter.“Sometimes, the behaviour of health workers and other staffers towards patients and their visitors escalates and leads to conflicts,” said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, administrative head of the Hospital. “The issue is not just the complaints made by the patients and their visitors, hospital officials have also noticed behavioural problems among health workers and other staffers.”To address growing complaints from patients and visitors, the hospital administration has decided to impart behavioural and communication skills training to its entire staffers, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and others.Officials hope this training will help lessen the growing grievances.“Proper communication and good behaviour are essential for all hospital staff including doctors,” said Dr Karmacharya. “These skills are also taught in universities and medical courses, but it seems some health workers have not paid much attention to these basics. Patients and their visitors should be treated like a hotel treats its guests.”Experts say complaints about rude behaviour are not only limited to any particular hospital but are prevalent across almost all hospitals in Nepal. Due to a lack of proper communication and behavioural skills, reports of scuffles between hospitals or doctors and the relatives of deceased patients take place frequently. Sometimes, these situations also take a nasty turn and doctors have been manhandled and hospitals vandalised. These disputes have also escalated into shutdown of the healthcare facilities, protests by health workers, and a halt in services.“Colleges under the Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine teach communication skills to the students of medicine,” said Dr Jagdish Prasad Agrawal, retired dean of the Institute of Medicine. “Although communication skills are part of the curriculum and a basic requirement for any health professional, it seems that many have not paid much attention to these skills.”Good communication skills and respectful behaviour are crucial for health workers, regardless of their other profession skills, officials at the Nepal Medical Council, the national regulatory body of medical doctors, said.They said that health workers can foster a positive environment in hospitals and improve interactions with patients and their relatives. “People in every profession need good communication skills, and those serving in the medical sector need them the most,” said Dr Bishwa Raj Dawadi, member of the Council. “The Council often receives complaints about doctors’ rude behaviour.”The council has made professional development training that includes communication skills mandatory for all medical doctors. Failure to attend the course will lead to non-renewal of the medical licence.As per the council’s rule, medical doctors must undertake this training regularly. The council assesses the effectiveness of the training every five years to ensure that medical doctors are up-to-date in their profession.Patients have to wait in long queues in state-run health facilities to see a doctor. Visitors of every patient expect immediate care, as they think that the problems of their patients are more serious than others’. Dawadi said that the success of health workers depends not only on the care they provide but also on their communication with patients.“To lessen risk of getting assaulted or mistreated by patients and their visitors, health workers, including doctors, must be good communicators,” said Dawadi. “Other hospitals should also provide communication and behaviour training to their staff.” \nNepal’s long-distance runner Santoshi Shrestha finished the Paris Olympics women’s marathon in the 79th position on Sunday.Shrestha took 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds to complete the 42.195km distance.A total of 91 athletes had competed in the women’s marathon, the last athletics event in Paris. Eleven athletes did not finish the race.Shrestha, however, could not beat her own personal best. She had won a gold medal in the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon with a time of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, setting a new national record.Shrestha was representing Nepal in the women’s marathon on the Olympics stage for the first time in 28 years. She is the fourth athlete from Nepal to compete in the women’s marathon at the Olympics.Last time, Bimala Rana Magar represented Nepal in the women’s marathon at Atlanta 1996. Nepal first sent its athletes in the women's marathon at Seoul 1988 when Raj Kumari Pandey and Menuka Rawat had taken part. Since Sydney 2000, Nepal has been participating only in short and middle distance events in women’s athletics.On Sunday, Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands won the gold in an Olympic record of 2 hours 22 minutes and 55 seconds. The Dutch had come into the marathon roughly 35 hours after shooting to bronze medals in 5,000m and 10,000m.Ethiopian Tigst Assefa won silver medal with a timing of 2:22.58 and Kenya's Hellen Obiri claimed bronze clocking 2:23.10.The current world record of 2:16:16 in women’s marathon is held by Kenya’s Peres Jepchirchir, which she set at the London Marathon in April this year.Shrestha was the last of the seven athletes from Nepal at the Paris 2024. Swimmers Alexander Shah set a national record in men’s 100m freestyle in Paris. Shah swam the distance in 51.91 seconds to improve his own previous record of 52.17 set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar. Shah finished third in his Heat and 59th overall among 79 swimmers, failing to progress into the semi-finals.Duana Lama also crashed out of the Heat stage in the women’s 200 m freestyle event as she finished last in the Heat 1 and 30th overall among 31 participants. Her time of 2 minutes 20.74 seconds could not even beat her previous best of 2 minutes 12.46 seconds. Gaurika Singh holds the national record in the women’s 200 m freestyle with 2:11.94 seconds.Badminton star Prince Dahal was eliminated from the men’s singles group stage. He suffered defeats to eventual gold medallist Viktor Axelson of Denmark, Ireland’s Nhat Nguyen, and Israel’s Misa Zilberman.Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha was knocked out from the preliminary round after he lost his men’s singles match to Senegal’s Ibrahima Diaw 12-10, 11-3, 11-4, 11-5. Santoo is the only third Nepali player to have qualified for the Olympics through a selection tournament after Sangina Baidya (Athens 2004) and Deepak Bista (Beijing 2008).Paris 2024 also marked Nepal’s debut in badminton and table tennis.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan could not progress from the first round as she lost her women’s 57 kg weight category Elimination round of 32 Pool A bout to Marcia Perisic of Serbia by ippon.Shooter Sushmita Nepal exited the Paris Olympics after finishing 42nd in the women’s 10 m air rifle qualification event. \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nThe luxurious new life of Pushpa Kamal Dahal is an antithesis of his younger days when he took up arms for the sake of the marginalised and downtrodden sections of society. As the leader of a bloody insurgency that claimed nearly 17,000 lives, Dahal has always had a legion of detractors. But when he first came out of the jungles to join mainstream politics, he also had a lot of public support, as was evident from the 220 seats his party won in the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The Maoist tally was double the number of the second-placed Nepali Congress, as the party got nearly 30 percent of all cast votes. By the time of the 2022 national elections, it had to be satisfied with 32 seats and just around 14 percent of the votes. The reason for this steady erosion in the party’s electoral support is clear enough. Primarily, it is a reflection of Dahal forgetting his roots. He is today no different to the ‘crony capitalists’ of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML he once blamed for all the country’s woes. There is now not a ‘progressive’ bone in his body. Yet following his ignominious exit as prime minister a month ago, Dahal has been in a hurry to put together a progressive alliance of socialist and left-learning forces. He is already in the four-party Socialist Front which, besides the Maoist Centre, also has as its members the CPN (Unified Socialist), the Nepal Socialist Party and the Communist Party of Nepal. The Maoist chief wants to further expand the collaboration between such like-minded forces. Moreover, his Maoist Centre party has announced a new nationwide campaign whereby it will go to people’s doorsteps to explain the party’s agendas and to get feedback. The feedback is likely to be angry. The party has long since abandoned its principled advocacy on behalf of women, Dalits, Janjatis and other marginalised communities—the groups that were its core voters. As things stand, on the right of the political centre in Nepal there is the Congress while the UML occupies the left of the centre. The people disenchanted with both these outfits are plumping for new forces like the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Janamat Party. Where in this political spectrum does today’s toothless Maoist party fit, one wonders. People won’t also be fooled by the formation of so-called leftist and socialist fronts. Dahal seems to remember his once core constituencies only when he is out of power. Disenchantment against him is growing, even within the Maoist Centre. After a long while, other party leaders are openly criticising his undisguised lust for power, most evident in his oscillation between the Congress and the UML just so he could occupy the prime minister’s chair. Some, like Narayan Kaji Shrestha and Janardan Sharma, have asked him to make way for a new leader. If Dahal is serious about reviving his party’s fortunes and leaving behind a credible legacy, he should be the one to make the most of the sacrifice. The options before him are limited. Gone are the days his gift of the gab alone could change people’s hearts and minds.  \nIn January 2022, I was brainstorming with a few friends to pool funds together—a crowdfunding of sorts—to make a political movie or web series. My point was that Nepal didn’t have many political movies that inspired politicians or aspiring politicians—instead, most movies portrayed politicians as dishonest people, if not downright criminals. To be fair, being a politician anywhere in the world is difficult. The unpaid hours, days, weeks and years you put into this endeavour without any certainty of ever coming to power would deter most people from ever coming close to this field.So, the idea behind the movie was to show that despite the very constraining environment Nepali politicians operate in, they can still make everyday decisions in the larger public interest. The story was to be something similar to “The West Wing” with a Nepali twist. This discussion took place several months before the election of Balen Shah and Harka Sampang and almost a year before the rise of Rabi Lamichhane and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The project failed to take off as we disagreed on the plot, and the dramatic rise of Balen and others stole the thunder from some project elements.The hook I had in mind was the emergence of a relatively unknown leader from within the system. The movie would open with breaking news that two ‘co-pilots’ of the then Communist Party of Nepal agreed to step aside in favour of a relatively unknown young leader as the next prime minister. The movie was to focus on this new leader rising to the occasion and delivering on public priorities even as the old guards in the party tried to stifle the reforms. The movie was to end in a cliffhanger with the new prime minister calling for a referendum for a directly elected PM. The parliament blocks this move, and the Supreme Court rules in favour of the premier.A positive political movie that showcases political disruption from within the existing system could inspire reform-minded politicians while giving hope to the audience in general. As a political reporter, I have observed many leaders closely; they are generally not bad people. They are confined in the vicious cycle of their own making. They start their day very early as constituents seek help and favours. The expenses for tea, snacks and even lunches are steep. Then, there is the need to be relevant within the party to get tickets or be considered for party positions or public offices. Finally, you must raise funds to win elections and cover other expenses. Once they get elected, recouping these investments takes precedence over public service. This is the plight of mid-level leaders. Those at the top have their tasks cut out, too. Managing the party is equivalent to making deals with different leaders to be at the helm. If you are in a position to form the government, your art of deal-making must be at a different high. It takes different skill sets, from keeping the coalitions intact to doling out limited plum positions to unlimited aspirants from the party and coalitions.In such a constraining environment, politicians in Nepal can barely keep their heads above water. They are drowning in the system they have designed. They have no time to think about delivering on their election manifestos, let alone their personal legacy.Reform from withinOne way to ease the pressure is to amend the constitution to allow a directly elected prime minister, among other things. This would mean that the old guards might lose control over the system. But what is the use of a system that keeps the guards themselves as prisoners and forces them to engage in an endless Sisyphean exercise?What happened in Sri Lanka in July 2022 and Bangladesh earlier this month foreshadows a larger regional political trend. While in contrast to much of the region, Nepal hasn’t seen the same level of democratic backsliding, the record on other aspects of governance is dismal. True, there is ample space for expressing discontent. But that is no consolation for the rising frustration over the lack of jobs and systemic unfairness for people without political connections. For instance, small businesses have seen a significant surge in what often appears like competing taxation from all three tiers of government, even as the business ecosystem continues to deteriorate. This will force more businesses to pull their shutters down, reducing the availability of already limited jobs in the market.Nepal has a history of frequent uprisings and regime changes, often occurring every decade or two. By that standard, another uprising is overdue now. Nepali politicians must accept that they failed to innovate and deliver if they want to avoid a fate similar to that of their regional counterparts. They need to initiate necessary constitutional reforms. Frequent overhauling of the political system on the wave of a political uprising doesn’t resolve the underlying issue: General incompetence, reluctance to admit failures and seek help, and the misguided belief that sacrifices made for the democratic movement absolve them of all shortcomings. While the current constitution has flaws, the bigger flaws lie in the character and content of our politics. If the general discontent is to be managed and another uprising prevented, Nepali leaders need to show that the current system can absorb both incremental and dramatic changes.Several smaller parties have already called for constitutional amendments—on issues ranging from secularism and inclusion to governance structure. It is high time that a national dialogue and referendum be held on some of these contentious issues before momentum builds against the current system and its keepers. Political uprisings are disruptive and, at times, have a tragic habit of being hijacked by other interest groups—leaving the public worse off than before. \nThe dramatic turn of events in Bangladesh has shocked many people. But the story, for the Nepalis, is all too familiar. Nepali political leaders, including former monarchs, have not differed from the deposed Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. All of them have blurred the thin line between democracy and autocracy and between good governance and misrule. What is even more striking is the role of India and questions about its foreign policy.India’s “pragmatic” foreign policy was, to a large extent, responsible for emboldening Hasina’s autocratic tendencies, making her impervious to the demands of democracy and the growing aspirations of the new generation.Given Bangladesh’s location and strategic importance, India had multiple overriding concerns and security imperatives.Hasina became India’s trusted ally. Given her historical and personal relations with India, it was easier for her to sympathise with them. India’s support for Hasina and the Awami League (AL) appears logical, given the fact that her party has served India’s strategic and economic interests. However, in the last round of elections, Bangladeshi people perceived that India had openly sided with the AL. India tried to convince the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party to take part in the elections but without success. India then supported AL’s attempt to hold the elections against the wishes of the larger civil society in Bangladesh. As a result, the voter turnout was very low and widespread irregularities were reported.Despite Western countries like the US expressing concerns about the legitimacy of the elections, India was instrumental in facilitating legitimacy to the sham election results. Growing disenchantment with Hasina gave a fillip to anti-India sentiments among the people. India’s foreign policy, in the last decade, has tried to recast itself in terms of pragmatism and flexibility, focused solely on India’s strategic interests. In his book, The India Way, India’s Minister of External Affairs, S Jaishankar, explains the idea of “Krishna’s Choice” as being undeterred by the collateral consequences. This means focusing on the self-defined “righteous” goals rather than on the righteousness of the means. Adopting such a foreign policy disregards the pervasiveness of anti-India sentiments in South Asia. As per Jaishankar’s philosophy, India does not need to be popular, it just needs to secure its interests.Such thinking is reasonable. Despite a significant level of anti-India sentiment in South Asia, India’s power and presence remain substantial. It has learnt to secure its interests, in spite of hostile governments.However, if India wants to claim leadership as a regional power in South Asia and beyond, stand up to global norms, and maintain stability in the region, it must adopt democracy as a pillar of its foreign policy. India’s foreign policy goals must align with the neighbourhood’s broader interests, particularly democracy and economic development.Without aligning with democracy, “pragmatism” in its foreign policy can only deliver short-term tactical gains that may quickly be overturned. On the other hand, prioritising democratic values and putting the interests of the people rather than the governments can become a long-term evolutionarily stable strategy.Perspectives from Nepal may offer some insights into India’s growing role in the region and how people from Nepal view India’s foreign policy.From a Nepali perspective, India’s foreign policy, in its current state, is problematic. For example, in recent years, India has not hesitated to empower Nepali politics and politicians that have hampered democratic values, promoted inequality and harmed people’s interests.India has been conducting its foreign policy in Nepal in three prominent ways. The first is by engaging with the government, whatever the propensity of the ruling regime and using all available leverages and powers to ensure that the party in power remains “friendly.” This strategy has often hampered the efforts of the Nepali people to democratise the parties and the country. India’s emphasis on this method has given rise to anti-Indianism as a political platform and as a feature of public psychology.There is also a more sinister Cold War era style of engagement. In engaging with Nepal’s political parties and ruling regimes, India has frequently resorted to its intelligence wings, whose brash and open interventions have amplified anti-India sentiments and spread them to the grassroots level. Every new government in Nepal seeks India’s support to ensure its longevity. In a recent closed-door conversation, senior party leaders told us that during state visits, Nepali prime ministers are under tremendous pressure to demonstrate that India supports them and that their visit is a success. They fear that without India’s support no government can expect to be durable.Another way India has cashed in is by supporting political movements. This has also had mixed results. When India sided with Nepal’s democratic forces against the King in 1989-90 as well as in 2005, it enraged the monarchist and nationalist forces. Similarly, in 2015, when it sided with the Madhesh movement, it angered the hill people and hill-centric parties, propelling them closer to China.The third way India has conducted its bilateral relations is through connectivity and development diplomacy. India has gradually achieved “irreversible” bilateral relations with Nepal through the strategy of improved connectivity, trade and economic integration. For example, in recent years, India and Nepal have worked on Integrated Check Posts (ICPs), hydro-power projects, petroleum pipelines, payment gateways and transmission lines. These forms of connectivity are gradually making it more difficult for Nepal to swing between India and China as in the past.In order to sustain its gains, India must demonstrate that its values align with the interests of democracy and the aspirations of the younger generation in the neighbourhood. Such values extend to economic equality, human rights, justice, identity politics and secularism. Unfortunately, the impact of the Indian government’s association with the Hindutva movement has spilled over borders; it has alienated Muslim populations in the neighbourhood, including in Nepal and Bangladesh. The case of Bangladesh also shows that if Hasina had strengthened democratic values and institutions, the social order in Bangladesh would not have come under strain even now.Another major factor why India must emphasise democracy and align itself to people’s interests in South Asia is the presence of China.China is waiting on the sidelines, biding its time, ready to pounce on the opportunities missed by India. Experts and policymakers in India do not believe China can gain access to the Indian market, given the current state of Sino-India relations and border disputes. But China is not fazed. It is confident that it has secured its interest in Tibet vis-à-vis Nepal. Now, it has its eyes on the Indian market. China’s persistence in investing in border infrastructure in Tibet, as well as in the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, shows its long-term strategy and confidence in its ability to gain access to South Asia.Khanal is Research Director at CESIF Nepal, a foreign policy think tank, and former Chief Editor of Ukaalo. \nFor decades, the primary goal of transport systems has been to move as much motorised traffic as quickly as possible from point A to point B. However, focusing on motorised vehicular traffic has made the transport sector one of the largest contributors to global emissions, producing significant levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.Consequently, modern transport planning, design and operations are increasingly driven by concerns about adopting greener, more sustainable systems that reduce emissions, improve public health and minimise costs. This new paradigm focuses on transport decarbonisation strategies to combat global warming and emphasises a people-centric approach. It prioritises populations having access to efficient, safe and inclusive transport for a wide variety of trip purposes.How to attract pedestriansThis shift aims to improve transport options and reduce both the frequency and overall distance of trips taken by motorbike or car, by promoting walking as the primary transport model. The interplay between land use, urban design, and road infrastructure design is critical in creating walkable environments.Efficient land-use planning can create compact, higher-density and mixed-use neighbourhoods where amenities and services are within walking distance (e.g., 15-minute city). Good urban design fosters walkability by prioritising human-scale development. This includes designing streetscapes and creating attractive public spaces, parks and amenities that are visually appealing and functional for pedestrians.Features such as building orientation, street furniture (like benches, water fountains and rubbish bins), wayfinding signage and landscaping play significant roles in making streets more inviting and functional, enhancing pedestrians' walking experience.Road infrastructure should be designed to enhance connectivity, accessibility and pedestrian safety by providing wide, well-maintained footpaths and creating direct, continuous paths free from obstructions between key destinations. To ensure pedestrians' safety and comfort, adequate lighting should be provided to enhance visibility and reduce the risk of accidents. Additionally, refuge islands and raised crosswalks can shorten distances, while frequent pedestrian crossings improve accessibility and convenience.Smart infrastructureTechnology including smart infrastructure, data analytics and digital mapping and navigation can significantly enhance infrastructure design and promote walkability. Smart infrastructure that integrates sensors and smart technologies can improve the efficiency and safety of pedestrian pathways. For example, smart traffic lights that adjust based on pedestrian flow can reduce waiting times and enhance safety.Collecting and analysing data on pedestrian movement patterns can help urban planners identify high-footfall areas and prioritise improvements. In addition, walking can be more appealing when detailed maps and navigation tools that highlight pedestrian-friendly routes and amenities are provided.Integrating walking with other modes of transport through Mobility as a Service platforms that provide real-time information about public transport options and their proximity to walkable routes can create seamless travel experiences using a variety of different modes of transport and facilitate more sustainable travel choices. The connection between good pedestrian infrastructure and increased public transport usage is evident by the study conducted in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur. Improving walkability in already developed, car-dependent neighbourhoods and cities requires a multifaceted approach.It requires retrofitting infrastructure, revising zoning policies and implementing placemaking.Retrofitting roadsExisting streets can be retrofitted by using a road diet approach. This involves reducing the number of lanes dedicated to cars to widen footpaths and make room for green spaces. Implementing local area traffic management and traffic calming measures such as speed bumps, narrower lanes and roundabouts to reduce vehicle speeds are also strategies to retrofit existing streets to enhance pedestrian safety and encourage walking.Revising zoning codes to allow for higher density and mixed-use developments can be achieved by repurposing existing—and potentially underutilised—spaces for new uses that can serve also as attractive destinations for walking. For example, converting parking lots into pedestrian-friendly areas with shops, cafes, community gardens and parks. Or converting and repurposing old factories or historic buildings near public transport hubs into community centres or mixed-use developments.To achieve the best results, land use and space conversion can be integrated with the placemaking process that focuses on creating vibrant, engaging public spaces by adding amenities like seating, lighting, public art and landscaping that reflect community needs and foster social interaction.A walkability assessment based on a place's walkability score—a multidimensional index assessing the pedestrian-friendliness of a location—is used to objectively assess walking-related strategies. Such assessments can be further improved by using advanced AI-based image processing techniques to provide valuable insights into how pedestrians perceive safety and comfort.Such tools can also automate the analysis of Google Street View data, allowing transport planners to identify trends and patterns in pedestrian perception across different urban areas. This data-driven approach helps prioritise improvements, targeted interventions and policy decisions aimed at enhancing walkability, fostering healthier lifestyles and reducing reliance on cars and other forms of motorised transport.Enhancing walkability is a powerful strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating healthier, more vibrant and more sustainable urban communities. By integrating thoughtful land use planning, urban design, and road infrastructure improvements and leveraging technology, cities can foster walkable environments that benefit both people and the planet.Susilawati is a senior lecturer in the School of Engineering at Monash University Malaysia.-360info \nMovie star Tom Cruise rappelled from the roof of France’s national stadium and received the Olympic flag, bringing a heavy dose of Hollywood to the closing ceremony of the Paris Games as the French capital handed over to the next host Los Angeles.Grammy-winning R&B artist H.E.R teased the Mission Impossible soundtrack as Cruise made his leap, drawing gasps from spectators as he dropped 50 metres to the floor of the Stade de France, in the finale to a ceremony that blended the traditional, the obscure and the razzle dazzle of Tinseltown.While Paris used iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Versailles to win the hearts of Olympians and spectators alike, LA was swift to turn to its star draw: A-list celebrities.Paris was bringing down the curtain on an Olympic Games that brought scintillating sport to the heart of the capital, breathing new life into an Olympic brand hurt by the difficulties of Rio de Janeiro’s 2016 Games and the soulless spirit of Tokyo’s COVID-hit event.Even Parisians were carried away by the Olympic fervour.“We wanted to dream. We got Leon Marchand,” Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet told the crowd, referring to the French swimmer who won four golds.“From one day to the next Paris became a party and France found itself. From a country of grumblers, we became a country of frenzied fans.”‘CULTURE OF PEACE’The two weeks of sporting drama saw China and the United States duke it out for top spot in the medal table right down to the last event.Echoing the heartache delivered to France by the United States in the men’s basketball final, the American women’s basketball side handed France a gut-wrenching one-point defeat to earn a 40th gold medal and top spot on the medal table.As the world emerged from the COVID pandemic in 2022, Paris had promised an Olympic “light at the end of the tunnel” and to provide the stage for a carefree Games.But Russia’s war in Ukraine on Europe’s eastern flank, conflict in the Middle East, and France’s heightened state of security alert loomed large as the Games got under way.International Committee President Thomas Bach saluted the athletes as he declared the Games closed.“During all this time, you lived peacefully together under one roof in the Olympic Village. You embraced each other,” Bach said. “You respected each other, even if your countries are divided by war and conflict. You created a culture of peace.”HIGH BAR FOR LOS ANGELESCruise’s exit on a motorbike saw the closing ceremony transition to a prerecorded video of the 62-year-old skydiving down to the Hollywood sign, where a wide shot showed the Olympic rings incorporated into the LA landmark.The flag was then passed from U.S. Olympians past and present as it traversed the city before reaching a beach party, where the LA music icons the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, and Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre performed.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has acknowledged Paris has set a high standard. But the City of Angels has billed itself as a beacon of diversity and will have Hollywood to fall back on.“They’ve got a high bar to reach. A lot of work to do,” said James Rutledge, 59, a former banker wearing a Team USA t-shirt outside the Stade de France. “Hollywood next? That’s something to play with.”SPORTING MEMORIESFrance will take away fond sporting memories.The French had a new golden boy to celebrate with swimmer Marchand emerging as the king of the pool, before French judoka Teddy Riner reigned supreme as he claimed his fifth Olympic gold medal.Simone Biles put her twisties misery of Tokyo behind her, making a long-awaited Olympic return in front of a star-studded crowd. She arrived the world’s most decorated gymnast and left with a further three gold medals for her trophy cabinet.Breaking made its Olympic debut - to some derision on social media - whilst 3x3 basketball, sports climbing, skateboarding and surfing made their second appearances.The IOC will be relieved that no major scandals erupted, although it did have to grapple with some controversies.A simmering doping row involving Chinese athletes hung over the Olympic swimming meet where the United States faced the biggest challenge to their reign in decades.A storm around gender eligibility hit the women’s boxing competition, revealing the toxic relations between the IOC and a widely discredited International Boxing Association.Meanwhile, a $1.5 billion clean-up of the Seine rewarded Paris with the optics of triathlon and marathon swimmers competing in the river through central Paris, without a wave of illness ensuing. \nEight members of a family in ward 8 of Resunga Municipality in Gulmi have been taken ill after eating wild mushrooms on Sunday evening.Members of Tom Bahadur Thapa Shirish’s family fell ill after eating mushrooms collected from Resunga Community Forest, according to the District Police Office, Gulmi.After receiving initial treatment at Gulmi District Hospital, they were taken to Lumbini Medical College in Palpa for further treatment. \nThe United States topped the medals table at the Paris Olympics with 40 golds after the final title was decided on Sunday, finishing above China only by virtue of their 44 silvers.China, who were the last team apart from the US to top the standings when they did it on home soil at the 2008 Beijing Games, also won 40 golds but managed only 27 silvers.The US women’s basketball team secured their country's pre-eminence by edging host nation France in a breathless finish to win the final gold of the Games. The US also won most total medals with 126 to China’s 91.France won 16 golds to finish fifth on the table and their total tally of 64 medals was their best for more than a century. \nAn ATR-72 turboprop plane operated by regional carrier Voepass crashed on Friday in a residential area near Sao Paulo, Brazil, killing all 62 passengers aboard.Investigators have recovered the plane's so-called black box containing voice recordings and flight data, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days, the head of Brazil's aviation accident investigation center, Cenipa, said on Sunday.How did the crash occur?The plane was bound for Sao Paulo from Cascavel, in the state of Parana, and crashed at around 1:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) in Vinhedo, some 80 km (50 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo.The aircraft was flying normally until 1:21 p.m., when it stopped responding to calls, and radar contact was lost at 1:22 p.m., Brazil's air force said in a statement. The plane did not report any emergency.Videos of the event show that the sky was apparently clear when the plane started spiraling in an unusual circling motion.What will experts be looking for?US aviation safety expert Anthony Brickhouse said investigators would look at aspects like weather and examine to what extent the engines and controls were functioning properly, to help identify what caused the loss of control.Could weather conditions have caused the crash?Videos of the crash analyzed by aviation experts led some to speculate that ice had built up on the plane. On Friday, Voepass said ice was predicted at the altitudes in which the plane was flying, but that it should have been within an acceptable level.Brazilian aviation engineer and crash investigator Celso Faria de Souza said he is almost certain ice caused the accident, judging from the video.ATR-72 planes have experienced issues with icing, with a crash in 1994 in the US state of Indiana killing 68, after the plane was unable to bank due to ice buildup. After that incident, manufacturer ATR improved its de-icing system. In 2016 in Norway an ATR-72 experienced issues after ice accumulated on the plane, but the pilot was able to regain control.Could the engine have failed?John Hansman, a professor in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reviewed some of the Brazil crash footage shared on social media and without having reviewed flight data said the crash did not appear to have been caused by weather.It may have been an engine failure on one side, mismanaged by the crew, which would lead to the rotation downward, said Hansman.Are multiple points of failure possible?Air crashes could be due to any number of factors, according to experts. Among them could be ice, engine failure or human error. In many instances there is more than one cause, said Robert A. Clifford, a lawyer who represented some of the families of crash victims in the 1994 accident. \n'Resonance of Hues', an ongoing art exhibition at Hotel Vivanta in Kathmandu, showcases the works of eight prominent Nepali artists, exploring Nepali culture through traditional and modern artistic expressions.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather is expected Monday with light to heavy rain likely in various provinces, accompanied by thunder and lightning, while nighttime may bring similar conditions with possible heavy rainfall in certain areas.\nNepali Congress faces pressure for timely general convention, with demands for adherence to party charter and criticism of leadership's performance, particularly in governance.\nIn autumn, drones will begin collecting garbage from Mt.

He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\nThe fifth edition of the Kathmandu Triennale, organised by the Siddhartha Arts Foundation and the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts, will occur in February 2026. It will feature more than one hundred artworks. The Triennale will take place at numerous venues, including the Nepal Art Council, Patan Museum, and Siddhartha Art Gallery. The theme of the Kathmandu Triennale is ‘Coexistence, Kinship, and Care’. The Australian Embassy supported and patronised previous editions of the Kathmandu Triennale. The embassy hosted a reception event to interact with potential patrons this time. One of the Artistic directors, Natalie King, is also an Australian curator.Australian ambassador Felicity Volk says, “As we look around at a world fractured by politics, by war and heightened geopolitical tensions, by climate change and environmental devastation, we are reminded that we also need to look for the ways we are united, the ways we can work in solidarity and harmony towards a better world for all people. And so there is no more important theme than that which Kathmandu Triennale 2026 will explore: Coexistence, kinship, care.” The event aims to promote Nepali arts and culture and establish Kathmandu as an international art hub. Artistic Directors Natalie King and Sujan Chitrakar will choose forty artists. “To a maximum of 10 Nepali artists, we will be providing an international counterpart”, says Chitrakar. To establish a long-lasting academic and cultural exchange within the region, the Triennale also seeks to organise a Students’ Triennale amongst various art institutions and their students. Tribhuvan University, Sirjana College of Fine Arts, and Kathmandu University will engage with institutions from countries such as India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and more. The Triennale began as the pioneering Kathmandu International Art Festival (KIAF), which set critical precedents during its 2009 and 2012 editions. It explored questions about the status of women and climate change. In 2017, the festival converted into the Triennale format, with an exhibition exploring the city as a creative locus. The programme will not be Kathmandu-centric to magnify the influence of the Kathmandu Triennale and foster greater inclusivity. A wide array of exhibitions and workshops will be conducted concurrently as satellite events that span beyond the valley. “It will be a global platform for Nepali artists to connect with international artists and stakeholders. I hope it will help recognise Nepal in the global map”, adds Chitrakar.  \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) claims to be a ‘cadre-less party’ on its official website, under the section ‘How Are We Different?’. The RSP emerged as the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives from the November 2022 general elections, within six months of its registration with the Election Commission.At the time, the party was truly an organisation without a cadre base and it emerged as a prominent political force by selling its anti-corruption agenda.The three largest parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—fight elections mainly based on their cadre strength across the country. Nepal’s communist parties are heavily dependent on their networks of cadres. Though the Congress used to claim to be a mass-based organisation, it has also become a cadre-based party with structures down to the 753 local units and deeper into wards and toles.The RSP mentions on its website eight points to show how it is different from other parties. One of the points presents itself as a party without cadres.Within two years of its formation, however, it is now considering building party committees down to the grassroots. The party plans to expand its organisation not only to local units but also their wards—just like the traditional parties.Soon after being ousted from government last month, the RSP organised a closed camp in Kathmandu on August 2-3, which decided to form party committees at the local level and also to form shadow local governments. It was the April Ilam by-election that changed RSP leaders’ perception and made them realise the importance of party committees at the local level. Despite its high expectations and mobilisation of the party’s full strength at the Ilam constituency, the party lost the election. RSP leaders later concluded that the weak party organisation was to blame.“A new party like ours has a weak organisation compared to more established parties. Due to this, the RSP could not do well in the Ilam-2 byelection,” Manish Jha, who then was the joint spokesperson for the party, had told the Post from Ilam.The party’s closed camp last week provided 15 points of suggestion to the leadership. One concerned forming shadow governments at local units along with the expansion of party committees.The 14th point is about “practising formation of shadow governments at local units in a phase-wise approach”. “The closed camp advised the central committee to form shadow governments at the local level but that is not an official party decision,” acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti told the Post. “But the central committee will probably support this proposal.” Despite the party officially announcing that it would be a cadre-free organisation, Burlakoti claims that the party has been constituting local committees since its formation. Currently, it has formed committees in 1,800 out of 6743 wards and sees the possibility of expanding them to at least 4,000 wards. Burlakoti says despite going down to the local level, the party won’t form large committees. But political observers are not convinced.“Without cadres, no political party can form its committees,” Pitamber Bhandari, a political observer, told the Post. “Formation of local chapters is a shift in the RSP’s stance.” The RSP, which claims to be an alternative political force, is considering following the footsteps of old parties by expanding party committees to the grassroots.Suryaraj Acharya, a former leader of Bibeksheel Sajha party that championed the idea of alternative politics in the country, said the RSP seems confused about the party structure. Acharya, who also contested the second Constituent Assembly election from Kathmandu-2, said the Bibeksheel Sajha also faced a similar confusion then. “Not only in Nepal, alternative political parties in other parts of the world also seem confused about their structures,” Acharya told the Post. “How can they lead alternative politics through a party similarly structured to old forces they so strongly criticised?”Burlakoti does not agree.“The structure itself is irrelevant when we make the committees small and disciplined,” he argues. Bhandari doesn’t buy Burlakoti’s argument.“When their party was in power, they recommended the party central committee member Arnico Kumar Panday as a member of the National Planning Commission. He relinquished party membership but when the party left the government, Panday resigned from the commission and rejoined the party,” Bhandari said. “How is their approach different then?” Bhandari questioned. Acharya doubts the RSP can reshape itself easily. They might also face difficulties in finding cadres at the grassroots level where the old parties have form bases. “Even if they find some people who can push their agenda through social media, it is difficult to find whole timers to run party committees.”Acting general secretary Burlakoti, however, said the RSP’s structure will be different to that of other parties. “Even as the committees of other parties are more inclined to misuse the budget at the local level, our party won’t indulge in such things.” Acharya recalls Bibeksheel Sajha’s mistake. “While we tried to give shape to the party structure, activists and some people without political culture joined us. This ultimately caused a lot of problems,” he said. “The RSP might face a similar problem if they are not careful.” \nFormer prime minister and CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal said on Saturday that he will propose broader unity among the leftist parties.According to party spokesperson Agni Prasad Sapkota, at the ongoing Standing Committee meeting, Dahal proposed a left unity that goes beyond the Socialist Front, an existing alliance of four left and socialist parties in Nepal. The front was announced on June 19 last year. Apart from the Maoist Centre, the CPN (Unified Socialist), the Nepal Socialist Party led by Mahendra Yadav and the Communist Party of Nepal led by Netra Bikram Chand “Biplav” are associated with the front.“Nepali people want greater unity among leftist parties and reorganisation of communist parties,” Sapkota quoted Dahal as saying. “That a similar plan did not work in the past does not mean it won’t work in the future as well.”The UML and the Maoist Centre formed an alliance in 2017 to jointly contest the general elections and won an overwhelming majority in Parliament. They merged to form the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) in June 2018. However, the party was dissolved in March 2021 after the Supreme Court invalidated the unified party’s registration.Dahal also hoped that, in due course, more parties and leaders would join hands for a larger reorganisation of the communist parties.The ruling UML, the largest communist party at the moment, has decided to stay away from such an alliance.Dahal stressed that there was no alternative to unity among the leftist parties, according to a leader who attended the meeting.“We are in talks with Madhav Kumar Nepal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and Netra Bikram Chand of the Communist Party of Nepal, as well as with some other outfits, in order to form a progressive alliance,” Dahal told the party’s standing committee. “Now, the time has come for unity among the left parties while also bringing together patriotic, pro-people and progressive forces.”The Maoist Centre, which is a distant-third biggest party in the House of Representatives with 32 seats, is discussing ways to improve the party’s image by launching a purge in the party and building a more solid organisational base. Several standing committee members urged the top leadership to launch a campaign to strengthen the party organisation, said Sapokta. The Maoist Centre also has decided to push for the directly-elected presidential system to ensure political stability.The Maoist party’s position is that there is no alternative to an executive president, said Sapkota. “We had also written a ‘note of dissent’ insisting on the same while drafting the constitution.”If the Nepali Congress and the UML want political stability, let’s elect an executive president, Sapkota proposed. “Only such a political system can ensure stability.”Sapkota said the leaders called for a purification campaign to strengthen the party and regain its lost glory. “The political situation has become difficult. In order to safeguard national interests, democracy and people’s livelihoods, we have to be stronger,” said Sapkota. “For this, we have to purge bad elements from the party. We have been weakened by the parliamentary system.”Leaders say a “serious soul-searching” is underway in the Maoist Centre, which emerged the single largest party from the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008 but has been consistently downsized in successive elections. Dahal was removed from the prime minister’s position last month, after the Congress and the UML joined forces against him. Now, Dahal, who faces multiple challenges, is working out strategies to revive the party. \nThe government is pushing ahead with a law to double the threshold for the representation of the parties in the House of Representatives and the provincial assemblies.In the draft bill to Amend and Consolidate the Election Law forwarded to the Election Commission for review, the Ministry of Home Affairs has increased the threshold for the House to five percent and to three percent for the provincial assemblies.In July last year, the constitutional election body had forwarded the draft amendments to the ministry, retaining the existing threshold of 3 and 1.5 percentages in the House and the provincial assemblies, respectively. However, the home ministry has revised the provision, making it more difficult for fringe parties to secure their presence in the legislature. “The home ministry has made some changes in the draft bill, including in the threshold [provision]. We are reviewing it,” a senior official at the commission told the Post. Currently, only the parties securing a minimum of 1.5 percent of the total valid votes under the proportional representation (PR) category in the provincial assemblies are given PR seats. The threshold is three percent at the federal level. These provisions were inserted through an amendment to the Election Act in July 2017, amid reservations from fringe parties.The CPN-UML, the Nepali Congress, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and four other parties managed to cross the three percent threshold in the 2022 parliamentary elections. The smaller forces with the national party status are the Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, and Janamat Party. Only five parties got the minimum five percent votes under the proportional system in 2022.The election commission has proposed 27 revisions to the electoral law through the amendment draft, including a provision to enable Nepali citizens living abroad to exercise their franchise. The commission has proposed provisions to allow them to vote under the PR category via Nepal’s diplomatic missions in the respective countries. The government has also made slight changes to the provision. It proposes that voting platforms can be offered after evaluating its feasibility in the host country, said the official. “There are no major changes in other provisions.”As per the commission’s amendment proposal, a candidate having been elected twice should be barred from standing in the proportional representation category again. There are currently no legal limits to how many times candidates can fight elections.The commission has also proposed that a candidate who has lost elections (local, provincial or federal) shall not be allowed to file candidacy from another constituency in either of the categories for five years, except for the by-election in the respective constituency.Moreover, the commission also plans to introduce the right to reject any candidate, with the ‘NOTA’ sign included in the ballot paper. For the first time in Nepal’s election history, the commission has proposed the NOTA [none of the above] option for voters who don’t want to vote for any of the candidates on the ballot. If NOTA votes exceed 50 percent of the total valid votes, the election will be cancelled.In the draft bill to amend election laws, the commission seeks to make it mandatory for the political parties to field at least 33 percent women candidates for the first-past-the-post polls. The commission says the changes have been proposed in the new integrated election law to replace seven different existing laws. The changes are based on Nepal’s constitution, the directives of the Supreme Court and past experiences.Enlisting voters through the electronic medium, collecting details of Nepali citizens living abroad to update the voter roll, and fixing the election day and duration of publicity campaigns are other proposed revisions.To ensure better representation of women, one of the two candidates for chairperson and vice-chair of rural municipalities or mayor and deputy mayor of municipalities must be a woman. The bill proposes that at least 33 percent of ward chair candidates must be women.Another proposal is that all candidates must submit their property details (including assets owned by their family members) while filing their candidacy.To avoid confusion over the start and end of the terms of elected representatives, the bill says it begins on the day of election for all winners of the House of Representatives, Provincial Assembly, and local government positions, while their term ends the day they file candidacy for the next election.Other proposed revisions require candidates to use the bank accounts to fund their campaigns declared while registering their candidacy, and allowing public transport on election day.To urge the government to register the bill in Parliament without delay, a team led by Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Thapaliya on Wednesday met with Minister for Home Affairs Ramesh Lekhak. “The home minister assured us that the bill would be registered in the ongoing session of Parliament. I find the government serious about the issue this time,” Thapaliya told the Post. \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nWomen generally pick green leaves from the sal tree (Shorea robusta) and stitch them into plates and bowls. Until recently, the process was all manual. Now, Phool Kumari Chaudhary, a homemaker in far-western Nepal, has something to cheer about.She collects leaves from the community forest nearby and sorts them out in the village.She then uses moulding machines to produce plates and bowls, which are traditionally used during fairs, festivals, and religious ceremonies in Nepal.“We collect leaves and dry them for a day. After that, we put the leaves on the machine and produce bowls and plates,” said Chaudhary, the Duna Tapari Producers’ Group coordinator in Rajghat, Krishnapur Municipality. Women are making leaf plates in self-help groups and selling them at the local market. This helps them support their families and in their children’s education.The business of making leaf plates has a huge potential. Besides being eco-friendly, the process is cheap and promotes a green economy.In city areas, some fast food vendors, restaurants and hotels have also started serving meals on sal-leaf dishes. Experts say that since Nepal’s hotels have decided to ban single-use plastics from January 1, 2025 as they join the fight against plastic pollution and a campaign to promote sustainable tourism, the demand for environment-friendly plates and bowls could rise.The women's group said that while single-use plastic items cause serious environmental problems, sal leaves are a sustainable option. Chaudhary said women associated with the Bandev Community Forest produced the environmentally-friendly plates and bowls after training.The leaf plates and bowls produced in Laljhadi are dispatched to the markets in Kathmandu and Pokhara. “So far, we have sent two consignments to Kathmandu,” said Chaudhary.The machine provided to the community produces bowls measuring 5 to 7 inches to plates of 10 and 12 inches. Bowls and plates cost Re1 to Rs6 apiece, depending on the size.“Most of the bowls and plates are used in the villages. We cannot fulfil the demand on special occasions,” Chaudhary said. It has become a side job for women, most of them farmers.“As we are busy on the farm or occupied with home’s daily affairs, we produce leaf bowls and plates during our free time,” said Chaudhary.The Bandev Community Forest group in Ward 5 of Krishnapur also started making bowls and plates in April. A total of eight women are engaged in the business.“We have not yet sent our products outside the village,” said Yasodha Rawal, treasurer of the community forest. “If we work daily, we can make good money,” said Rawal. Rawal said that after the community forest coordination committee in the Laljhadi Mohana Conservative Area provided training, they started making leaf bowls and plates.As the demand for bio plates and bowls is increasing, women’s groups plan to open a shop and cater to other districts too.Due to the rainy season, women are no longer able to go to the jungle. The leaves collected previously are being used to make bowls and plates.The machine can produce 500 bowls and plates a day. The women's group also buys the leaves collected by others.Large and green healthy leaves are primarily available during the March-April period.There is a slack season, when demand drops. “During the spring season, as women were busy harvesting wheat, we suffered a loss as the leaves decayed,” said Rawal.Sal leaves that used to rot in the community forest are being processed now to generate income from women, said Niraj Bhandari, president of Bandev Community Forest, Rajghat. This has helped many women become self-dependent. Experts say this could be an alternative for plastic and glass utensils in hotels, restaurants, and hospitals for cost and environmental reasons and without compromising hygiene.Leaf plates are easy to dispose of and can also be fed to cattle. \nThe CG Corp Global and the Enhanced Skills for Sustainable and Rewarding Employment (ENSSURE) project on Friday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the apprenticeship programme regulated by the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT).The agreement was signed by Nirvana Chaudhary, managing director of CG Corp Global, and Rabindra Bahadur Singh, team leader of the ENSSURE project, a bilateral initiative of the government of Nepal and Switzerland, executed at the federal level by CTEVT and at the provincial level by the education-related ministries with technical assistance from Helvetas Nepal.Dr Danielle Meuwly, ambassador of Switzerland to Nepal, Mahesh Bhattarai, member secretary of the CTEVT, and Dr Prabin Manandhar, country director of Helvetas Nepal attended the MOU signing ceremony.CG Corp Global will provide apprentices to 100 youths who are skilled technicians in various occupations such as hotel management, mechanical engineering, automobile engineering, and early childhood development facilitators, etc., said a statement issued after signing of the MoU.“In the apprenticeship programme, youths receive some theoretical knowledge and practical competencies in a technical school but hone their skills at the industry under the supervision of an in-company trainer,” the statement said. “Eventually, they receive a pre-diploma or diploma certificate awarded by CTEVT.”Young people gain industry networks, earn while they learn and obtain a recognised qualification, it said. “This collaboration will bridge the gap between education and employment, providing youths with the necessary skills and opportunities to thrive in their careers,” Managing Director of CG Corp Global Chaudhary said.Stating that Switzerland has a century-old tradition of dual education for apprenticeship, that is education that takes place both in school as well as in companies and industry, Ambassador Meuwly said 70 percent of Swiss youths do this type of dual education at secondary level.“Many managers in successful Swiss companies, such as top Swiss banks, graduated as apprentices,” she said. Member Secretary Bhattarai said that this partnership will significantly contribute to their mission of providing quality vocational education and training that meets the demands of the industry.Manandhar said this partnership will not only enhance vocational training but also ensure that it aligns with industry standards and meets the needs of the market. \nIndia has agreed to build for Nepal a slew of petroleum projects on grants, in what is being billed as a sign of renewed engagement between the two immediate neighbours.Observers, however, see the development differently. It could make Nepal more dependent on fossil fuels. This despite the country having abundant renewable energy in the upcoming years to power the transport sector as well as energy-efficient electric stoves in its kitchens.On the one hand, commitments are made in different high-level global forums to adopt green energy, and on the other, petroleum pipelines are being built. Chandi Prasad Ghimire, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, said that Minister Damodar Bhandari met Hardeep Singh Puri, minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, India, during the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in New Delhi on Wednesday and shared the news about the agreement on the petroleum pipeline projects.“We were unclear about funding modalities. But now it’s clear that all three projects will be built by the Indian government on grant.”The agreed projects are an oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa; a greenfield tank terminal in Charali; and an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan.The estimated cost of these projects is Rs17 billion.Nepal has also proposed a cross-border liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline. “The funding modality of the LPG pipeline is yet to be decided,” said Ghimire. An energy expert working in a government project, who wished not to be named, told the Post that building an LPG pipeline is another blunder. “Nepal will see a considerable amount of electricity generation that could substitute cooking gas and reduce trade deficit,” he said.“Building new pipelines free of cost means Nepal has to sign a long-term fuel import agreement with India to raise the construction cost.”Nepal aims to increase clean energy generation to 15,000 MW by 2030 and plans for it are on track.Experts say it's a double standard.Ram Prasad Dhital, an energy expert, told the Post last December that billions of rupees spent on pipeline projects will go to waste. According to him, there is an immediate need to decarbonise the transport sector, and most countries, including Nepal’s two immediate neighbours, are already moving in that direction.What’s the rationale behind investing in the oil pipelines, experts have questioned.While the Nepal government has committed to net-zero emissions by 2045, it is building the petroleum pipeline.The new petroleum pipelines and storage tanks will increase Nepal’s dependence on fossil fuel, said Bhushan Tuladhar, an environmental expert.“This kind of policy discourages energy transition. If we have the strength of green energy, we should promote it. We should not rely on fossil fuels, which we don’t produce,” Tuladhar added.Nepal imports petroleum products worth Rs337.34 billion, which comes to nearly 20 percent of the country’s total import bills. Tuladhar said Nepal needs to substitute fossil fuels with green energy to reduce the ever-growing trade deficit.He said that instead of investing in fuel pipelines, the government should invest in renewable hydropower, cross-border energy trade and installation of charging stations for EVs.To fulfil the net-zero emission commitment by 2045, the government has also introduced an ambitious hydropower roadmap.In the transport sector, Nepal has launched a strategy to increase the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) to 90 percent of all private passenger vehicles, including two-wheelers, sold and 60 percent of all four-wheeler public passenger vehicle sales by 2030.Massive tax waivers have been given on EV imports to promote electricity and reduce fossil fuel imports.The agreement to build the oil pipeline projects even if it is fast tracked, may take five to six years. And by that time, a rough estimate shows that electricity generation and EV sales would take a quantum leap. In the first 11 months of this fiscal year, EV sales have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Nepal imported fossil fuel-consuming 10,310 units of passenger vehicles worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billion.Tuladhar said Nepal’s private sector is aggressively investing in the hydro sector, and the government’s investment in petroleum infrastructure could be a setback for them as well as the country.The government has also set a goal of installing 500,000 improved cooking stoves, primarily in rural areas, and an additional 200,000 household biogas plants and 500 large-scale biogas plants.Nepal’s strategy is to have electric stoves as the primary mode of cooking in 25 percent of households by 2030.It is estimated that to meet the target, Nepal would need to invest $25 billion.Nepali politicians have been making many promises to switch to clean energy.Last December, then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal attended the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28) in Dubai and spoke on climate finance Nepal seeks from the international community.In his speech at the summit, Dahal said, “Nepal is fully committed to the Paris Agreement. We are committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, five years earlier than the global target. We will fully utilise our hydropower potential to secure clean energy and maintain 45 percent forest-covered land.”Before attending COP28 in May, Dahal and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to build two cross-border pipelines and one petroleum tank with grants from the Indian Oil Corporation during Dahal's visit to New Delhi, India. In New Delhi, two ministers discussed building the Motihari-Sarlahi LPG pipeline, said Ghimire. “The agreement for this project will soon be finalised. We have requested the Indian government to build the LPG pipeline on grant.” Ghimire said that these projects will contribute to reducing the transportation cost.The construction work may start within 2-3 months.“Our commitment to reducing carbon emissions on international forums and building petroleum pipeline projects don’t match. But we don’t have any alternative to meet the energy demand right now.” he said. “So, we need a few petroleum projects.”Experts, however, question what the country will do with the hydro energy the government and the private sector are producing with billions of dollars of investment. The pipe-line project may take 5-6 years to complete and there seems to be no plan to substitute petroleum imports. “The government's policy is to increase the use of electricity, but supply is unreliable,” Ghimire said. Experts, however, questioned whether the electricity supply will remain unreliable even after five years. “Something is cooking here,” they say. \nIs Nepal set to launch its first judicial inquiry into recent air crashes?Despite 71 years of aviation history punctuated by 109 air accidents, Nepal has thus far never initiated a judicial or criminal inquiry.On Thursday, in a landmark move, the parliamentary International Relations and Tourism Committee ordered the government to form an independent inquiry commission to look into the country’s overall air safety standards and recommend action if someone is found guilty, particularly in connection with recent plane crashes.The parliamentary committee has given the experts commission 15 days to submit a report.“The two air accidents in two weeks have dented the country's image. We need to find a way to prevent future accidents and bring officials responsible for such utter negligence to justice,” said Raj Kishore Yadav, the committee chairman.Many lawmakers have echoed these concerns, calling for the prosecution of responsible officials. They have criticised the civil aviation regulator for its apparent negligence. The order means Nepal has formally initiated judicial proceedings through a separate investigation commission, which can hold the airline companies, the regulator, aircraft manufacturers, pilots, engineers, and others accountable for gross negligence and misconduct that have resulted in loss of life.“That’s a landmark order. But there are no specific laws in Nepal under which the guilty can be prosecuted,” said Rajan Pokhrel, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. “The Civil Aviation Act talks about judicial proceedings, but there is no law to enforce them.”For example, if a government-formed independent investigation commission recommends cancelling an airline company’s licence for gross negligence, there will be a confusion about who will enforce the recommendation. In Nepal, the results of accident investigations are not admissible in court and do not result in fines or other consequences.However, in many countries, investigations are typically conducted in two different ways. For example, in France, a pair of investigations are simultaneously conducted: the judicial investigation is directed by a prosecutor or undertaken under his control, and the safety investigation is conducted by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA).These two investigations have different objectives. The judicial inquiry aims to determine fault that may result in liability being established and, thus, convictions.The BEA investigation aims to improve aviation safety for passengers and crews. Unlike judicial investigations, the safety investigation does not presuppose the existence of a misdemeanour or a crime.The BEA investigation follows international rules from the ICAO. The judicial inquiry is based on national law and is undertaken under wildly varying conditions from one country to another. Thus, in some countries, the judicial investigation only starts after the safety investigation.Although in France these investigations are independent of each other, the law has determined their relationship. Thus, for example, flight recorders are placed under seal by the judicial authorities and handed to the BEA to be read out under its control. Further, regular contacts are established between the BEA and the authorities in charge of judicial investigations.The United States also conducts investigations in two different ways.In Nepal, under Article 26 of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, 1944, the government is obliged to institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the accident by the procedure recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Under Nepal’s Civil Aviation (Accident Investigation) Regulations, 2014, which follows Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the sole objective of investigating an accident or serious incident is to prevent accidents and incidents in the future. Therefore, Annex 13 investigations do not consider apportioning blame or liability.Any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability will be separate, as per Nepal’s Accident Investigation Regulations. “The regulations and Act both talk about judicial or administrative proceedings, but there are no particular laws to enforce the results,” says Pokhrel.However, lawyers say it doesn’t stop them from filing criminal charges and unlimited liabilities.Amrit Kharel, an advocate who has filed criminal charges against the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal and Yeti Airlines accusing them of gross negligence that killed 72 people in Pokhara in January 2023, said, “In our territory, it’s our sovereignty to file a case against any misconduct.”The investigation commission under the ICAO Annex 13 is just a fact-finding committee. “But if any person dies due to negligence, they should not be granted any amnesty,” Kharel says. Kharel has been fighting the case on behalf of the families of the US-Bangla Airlines Flight 211 that crashed in Kathmandu in March 2018, killing 51 of the 71 people aboard. Victims have demanded a total compensation worth Rs2.10 billion after the Bangladesh airlines and its insurers and reinsurers failed to provide appropriate compensation.“The case of Yeti Airlines is also gross negligence by the company and the regulator. A criminal investigation is necessary as negligence is growing in Nepal and innocent people are dying as a result,” Kharel adds. He said that if the court finds a person or company guilty of a crime, it’s the state’s responsibility to prosecute them. “No separate aviation law is needed to prosecute the guilty.”On January 15 last year, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed while approaching the new Pokhara airport. The Post also reported that flight calibration, which tests all equipment at the new airport, had yet to recommend landing from the west, the path followed by the Yeti flight.Experts at the time pointed out that the flight procedure was not published, and the airline had very little information on airport procedures and data.No evaluation as required by the ‘safety management system’ carried out, either by the civil aviation regulator, as an airport service provider, or by the airline.“The civil aviation body misused its regulator role to run the airport, neglecting safety requirements. It was a serious crime and mass murder, and subject to criminal investigation,” one aviation expert had said at the time.Speaking in the House on Thursday, Lawmaker Prabhu Sah said frequent crashes have sent the message that Nepal’s air safety is poor. “Relevant agencies should be held responsible and accountable for this. We cannot tolerate this any more. Officials take bribes and people die. The government that only takes the onus for positive things should also take responsibility for the growing corruption.” Though lawmakers who make laws have ordered a separate independent investigation commission to probe the frequent crashes, even if the commision produces the report, experts say, it’s unclear who will implement it.“Legal proceedings are indeed one of the effective measures to overhaul Nepal’s civil aviation,” said Sanjiv Gautam, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. “There are few instances in which courts have prosecuted even the dead pilots for gross negligence.”In a recent example, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a US criminal fraud charge stemming from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners, angering the families of the hundreds of passengers killed who had wanted the case to go to trial.In October 2018, 189 people were killed when Lion Air Flight 610 fell into the Java Sea off Indonesia. In March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa airport, claiming 157 lives.Nepal’s civil aviation service started in 1953 with three old American-made DC-3 Dakotas belonging to an Indian company. After five years, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation was established.Nepal’s aviation sector has grown faster than expected, with passenger traffic climbing from one million to 10 million in just over two decades. \nNearly 60 percent of drinking water samples collected from various places of Lalitpur district—Lalitpur Metropolitan City, Godawari and Mahalaxmi municipalities—are found to be contaminated with faecal coliform.Officials at the Health Office, Lalitpur said that drinking water samples were collected from the local units following an outbreak of cholera in recent weeks.“Out of 12 samples of drinking water collected for quality checks, faecal coliform was found in seven,” said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Lalitpur health office. “We have started chlorinating drinking water at the sources and have taken other measures to prevent further spread of waterborne diseases, including cholera.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or in their faeces. The presence of faecal coliform indicates that the drinking water being used by the residents of Thaiba in Godawari Municipality in Lalitpur is contaminated with sewage, according to doctors.Of the 30 cholera cases reported from across the country, 19 were from various areas of Lalitpur and the remaining from Kailali (8), Kathmandu (1) and Pyuthan (2).Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and or even death within a few hours if untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Faecal coliform had also been detected in the study carried out on water samples collected from Godawari Municipality before the onset of monsoon.As the monsoon is an epidemic season, when most drinking water sources become contaminated due to flooding, presence of deadly microbes—E coli and faecal coliform—in drinking water is not unusual, health officials say. Even jar water, which is generally considered safer compared to water from other sources, often gets contaminated during the monsoon season.What concerns officials most is the apathy of the responsible agencies in launching awareness drives about the risks and other preventive measures. Most local authorities across the country halted testing of drinking water just before the start of monsoon citing budget constraints.Officials at the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL) said that it is the responsibility of consumers themselves to ensure that water is safe before drinking, as the utility cannot guarantee the safety of drinking from every tap.“We request consumers to boil water properly before drinking, as water gets contaminated during the monsoon season due to leakage in pipes and mixing of drainage and rainwater,” said Sailaja Acharya, assistant manager of the KUKL. “We have increased the level of chlorine at the treatment plant and in reservoirs, but water could get contaminated when it reaches household taps.”The KUKL has started supplying water from the Bagmati river to household taps after supply from the Melamchi River was halted. Officials said that water from the Bagmati River gets chlorinated before being supplied to household taps. Doctors say consumption of contaminated water not only can cause diarrhoeal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the risk of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.They stress that awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to protect people from water-borne diseases. A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment is required to contain the spread of infection, according to doctors. \nThe Health Department under the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) is working to issue a tender to buy medicines in bulk for its planned fair-price pharmacies, which will be set up in various locations.KMC officials hope that pharmaceutical companies will offer hefty discounts on bulk purchases, allowing these pharmacies to sell medicines to patients at reduced prices.“It will take a few more months to start the fair-price pharmacies as we are finalising the tender process for buying medicines,” said Sajina Maharjan, an official at the department. “Patients will get medicines at lower prices at our pharmacies, as we will keep only a 20 percent margin on the cost of the medicines.”The KMC plans to set up altogether five fair-price pharmacies across the city. Officials said these pharmacies are part of the KMC’s efforts to provide relief to the metropolis residents. Officials said that the pharmacy will operate independently, but will charge lower prices to patients from the discounts provided by drug companies. According to them, these pharmacies will sell medicines at rates below the maximum retail price.Pharmacies of some state-run hospitals, like the Manmohan Cardiothoracic Vascular and Transplant Centre and the Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, have been running fair-price pharmacies for years.Those pharmacies sell medicines for up to five times less than the maximum retail price.Even after selling medicines for heavily subsidised prices, those hospitals are not incurring losses. In fact, even at these discounted rates, the hospitals’ doctors admit the pharmacies still make a profit of around 20 percent.This is mainly because pharmaceutical companies, like most other companies, set their own MRPs, leading to exorbitant markups. They supply medicines to hospitals and pharmacies at a fraction of the listed price, while most hospitals and pharmacies sell drugs at the inflated MRP.This kind of fraudulent practice is just one example of the deep-seated collusion among drug manufacturing companies, hospitals and pharmacies, and even doctors. Whether it has to do with pricing or prescribing medicines, officials at the Department of Drug Administration said the patients are the only ones at a disadvantage.According to officials, when a drug manufacturer comes up with a new drug, they are legally required to register the product with the Department of Drug Administration. The manufacturer proposes its own MRP, which the department then endorses. Since there are no rules in the Drug Act regarding the pricing of medicines, companies base their prices on those of similar medicines produced by other national and international companies. They can either inflate the prices or keep them lower. But most companies sell their medicines through promotional activities—either by offering incentives to doctors or by providing big margins to wholesalers and retailers. \nIn a bid to address growing mental health problems in children and adolescents, the Ministry of Health and Population has decided to train health workers to examine their mental health conditions.Officials said that as many as 150 health workers, including medical officers, nurses and paramedics, will be trained to screen the mental health conditions of this age group within the current fiscal year.“We hope that the health worker training programme will help lessen existing mental health problems in children and adolescents,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Those serving in primary health care centres will be trained first so that children and adolescents from villages will get access to the services easily.”A report of the National Mental Health Survey Nepal-2020 shows that the prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents was 5.2 percent that year, and the neurotic and stress-related disorders were the most prevalent at 2.8 percent.Likewise, the prevalence of current suicidal thoughts among adolescents was around four percent, while suicidal attempt in the same age group was 0.7 percent. The same report also shows that 0.6 percent of children and adolescents were found to have been suffering from depression.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, lifetime suicidal attempts and future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.Experts say that mental health problems in children and adolescents could be several times more than what the survey portrays. They say that around 10 to 15 percent of the total children and adolescent population could have been suffering from various types of mental health issues, and due to methodological problems, the survey could not portray actual problems.“Children and adolescents could suffer from various types of mental health problems, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, conduct disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder,” said Dr Arun Kunwar, child and adolescent psychiatrist. “But very few parents and teachers realise the problems and seek medical attention. Children get scolded and beaten both at schools and at home.”A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis have mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Health officials said that there are only around half a dozen child and adolescent psychiatric doctors in the country, and only a few are serving in state-run health facilities. Similarly, the major contributors to the treatment gap are societal beliefs, traditions and stigma associated with mental disorders, according to experts.“This training will help health workers notice problems and refer patients to health facilities with child psychiatrists and psychologists,” said Thapa.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nA bi-weekly situation update published by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division on Monday shows one death from the dengue disease and over 300 positive cases. Since the start of this year, the number of people infected with the virus has reached 2,365.Public health experts warn that the death toll and case numbers could go up further in the coming days. They criticise the authorities for their narrow approach—focussing solely on counting cases and deaths, which does little to control the outbreak of the deadly disease.“The authorities have neither conducted risk mapping nor taken measures to lessen the spread of the deadly virus,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Counting cases and deaths is not enough. Even the reported figures are far from reflecting the actual scale of the outbreak.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.“Dengue virus is not like the coronavirus, which spread all over the world suddenly,” said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, an infectious disease expert who is also the administrative head of Dhulikhel Hospital. “We can use the existing data for risk mapping, step up surveillance, and predict disease outbreaks accordingly.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. They say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Even symptomatic patients do not seek treatment at the hospital unless their symptoms get severe. What concerns them much is that many patients take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs—Flexon tablets, Nims, and Rynex, among others—to cure body aches caused by the dengue infection. Using such drugs is very risky during dengue infection.Doctors warn that using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat dengue can increase the risk of internal bleeding, including in the eyes, elevate enzyme levels and damage the liver.Some patients who use NSAIDs in excess also suffer internal bleeding. Such patients need to transfuse platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate, according to them.Health agencies concerned have been shifting responsibilities to other agencies that are ill-equipped and lacking in both financial and human resources.“Every day, 16 to 17 people in our district get infected with the dengue virus,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. Health agencies at the local level have been asked to launch a dengue search and destroy campaign and ramp up awareness about the risks.”Experts say most local units lack the budget and human resources to launch preventive measures. They say that a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nMartyrs Memorial A-Division League champions Church Boys United are ready to face Bhutan’s Paro FC in the qualification playoff of the AFC Challenge League, head coach Bal Gopal Maharjan said on Friday.Church Boys will host Paro at the Dasharath Stadium on August 13. The winners will secure one of the two berths in the group stage of the new third-tier Continental men’s competition.Abdysh-Ata of the Krygyz Republic and Afghanistan’s Attack FC are battling in the other preliminary stage ties for the other remaining spot.The group stage of the Challenge League consists of 18 teams—16 of them qualified directly for the group stage based on their AFC Member Association Rankings.Church Boys are ranked 20 in the Member Association rankings, while Paro are in the 22nd position. The higher ranked team in the tie host the match.Church Boys enjoyed a meteoric rise last season when they won the A-Division League title in their debut season in 2023, also becoming the only second team to win C, B and A division leagues in consecutive seasons after Manang Marshyangdi Club in 1986.Paro’s tale in the Bhutan Premier League is equally inspiring. They were the runners-up in Bhutan’s top tier league in their debut season in 2018 and capped off their impressive arrival with their first league title the next season in 2019. After finishing third in the 2020 season, they won the league for three successive seasons in 2021, 2022 and 2023/24.Maharjan said his men have no problem in facing the Bhutanese. “We have been training for almost a month now. Although our preparations have been short, our team has players who have regularly played for the national team,” said the former national coach Maharjan, who led Nepal to Bangabandhu Cup title in 2016 in Bangladesh and Three Nations Cup trophy in 2021 in Kathmandu. Maharjan also led Nepal’s U-23 team to South Asian Games gold in 2019.“I believe the team will play good football,” Maharjan added.But Paro will be determined to pull off their first ever victory in the continental competition. They were eliminated in the preliminary rounds of the AFC Cup three times (in 2020, 2022, 2023/24).They had lost to Machhindra Club in the Preliminary Round 1 of the AFC Cup at the Dasharath Stadium last year.Church Boys have already announced their 23-member squad for the Paro clash.The draw for the group stage will take place on August 22.Church Boys SquadGoalkeepers: Deep Karki, Tikendra Thapa, Rembo ChaudharyDefenders: Chhiring Lama, Ekraj Budhathoki, Omolaja Kareem, Saubhagya Rai, Ananta Tamang, Yogesh Gurung, Sanish ShresthaMidfielders: Arik Bista, Peter Banda, Santosh Khatri, Bibek Paudel, Rohan Karki, Laken Limbu, Manish JhargaForwards: Anjan Bista, Moses Gyabaah Twum, Niraj Chaudhary, Ayush Ghalan, Sanjeeb Bista, Aditya Shakya \nIn what is being called in Indian media to be her first statement since resigning and fleeing the country on August 5, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina has accused foreign powers like the US of playing a hand in her ouster.Indian news outlet The Print in an article today said it had seen the message conveyed to Hasina's Awami League supporters. India's Economic Times also carried an article about the message, which The Daily Star has not been able to independently verify.“I could have remained in power if I had left St Martin and the Bay of Bengal to America,” she said in the message.According to The Print, the Hasina government saw strained relations with the US for many years. Ahead of January's elections this year, she said “a white man” had offered her a smooth return to power in exchange for an airbase.Hasina also warned the new interim government not to be “used” by such foreign powers.Led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, the new interim government was sworn in on Thursday night, three days after Hasina's ouster.“I resigned so that I did not have to see the procession of dead bodies. They wanted to come to power over your [students'] bodies, I did not allow it. I came with power,” read Hasina's statement.“Maybe if I was in the country today, more lives would have been lost, more wealth would have been destroyed,” she added.She is also expected to address the media while in India next week, The Print article said.Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled Bangladesh on August 5, when a student-led protest culminated in a mass uprising against her Awami League government.More than 400 people were killed in the preceding three weeks, a majority of them in police firing and firing by Awami League activists.The US is Bangladesh's largest foreign direct investor.In her message to supporters and party cadres, she vowed to return to the country, though accepting her defeat.“I will return soon inshAllah. The defeat is mine but the victory is [that of] the people of Bangladesh,” she stated.“I removed myself, I came with your victory, you were my strength, you did not want me, I myself then left, resigned. My workers who are there, no one will lose morale. Awami League has stood up again and again,” she added, according to The Print.The former prime minister also accused people of distorting her words.“I want to repeat to my young students, I never called you Razakars … My words have been distorted. A group has taken advantage of your danger,” she said in the message.The term “Razakar” is considered to be derogatory in Bangladesh as it refers to 'volunteers' who collaborated with the Pakistan Army during Bangladesh's 1971 war for independence. \nA landslide at a landfill in Uganda’s capital Kampala has killed eight people, the city's authorities said on Saturday.The incident happened late Friday after heavy rainfall when sections of the landfill collapsed, covering some nearby houses, Ugandan media reported.Kampala Capital City Authority said government and Red Cross personnel were searching the site and had rescued 14 people.“On a very sad note, eight people have so far been found dead, six adults and two children. The rescue operation is still ongoing ...,” the authority said on its X account.The landfill, known as Kiteezi, has served as Kampala’s sole garbage dump for decades and has turned into a big hill. Residents have long complained of hazardous waste from the site polluting the environment and posing a danger to people.Footage from NTV Uganda television showed people walking on a section of the landfill that had crushed parts of a house, while pictures from UBC Uganda showed an excavator attempting to dig up garbage.Parts of Uganda have been experiencing heavy rains in recent weeks causing flooding and landslides, though no fatalities had previously been reported. \nJuddha Shumsher's zoo in 1932 featured an array of animals including elephants, horses, deer, monkeys, tigers, rhinos, clouded leopards, red pandas, bears, Himalayan gorals, pheasants, Himalayan monals, gharial crocodiles, porcupines, and a lion, among others.\nBangladesh-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin reveled that almost all of her books translated into Nepali are unauthorized, leading to the prevalence of pirated translations and prints of international literature in Nepal's book market, raising concerns about poor quality and moral and legal violations.\nIn 1998, the tragic and sensationalised suicide of Kani Sherpa, a Nepali domestic worker in Kuwait, ignited outrage and cast a shadow over domestic work migration from Nepal. In response, the Government of Nepal enacted various forms of bans on migration to protect its citizens abroad, culminating in an umbrella ban on domestic work migration in 2017. Yet, the demand for Nepali domestic workers remains high, as evidenced by the visas issued by employers abroad. As a result, many poor Nepali citizens, predominantly lower caste women, continue to seek work abroad without proper labour permits, facing increased vulnerability to exploitation. The government refuses to acknowledge that domestic workers could achieve better migration outcomes and ignores the actors benefiting from these restrictions. Unlicensed agents, licensed recruitment agencies, employers, politicians, government agencies, civil society organisations, insurance agencies, travel agents and research consultancies recognise that lifting the ban would empower Nepal’s poorest women but disrupt their businesses. The fact that this ban has endured for eight years—solidified by the government's imposition of seven pre-conditions in 2020 with no clear timeline—reveals a disturbing truth: These actors prioritise their interests over the well-being of Nepal’s most vulnerable.In this article, drawing on research conducted in Sindhupalchowk and Jhapa, we invert the dominant narrative by exploring: If migrant domestic workers aren’t benefiting from Nepal's migration ban on domestic work migration, who is reaping the benefits at the expense of thousands of Nepali domestic workers? The recruitment industryThe actual beneficiaries of the migration ban are recruitment industry actors, primarily unlicensed agents (or brokers), licensed recruitment agencies and employers. With estimates of 50,000 to 100,000 active agents in Nepal, this business thrives as Nepalis seek domestic work abroad. Nepalis rely on trusted individuals—relatives, teachers, former ward presidents, politically connected persons—as their \"agents\". Women seeking domestic work either contact these agents or are targeted through house-to-house recruitment drives, with agents focusing on households facing vulnerabilities like debt, illness, or domestic violence. These agents receive a portion of the recruitment fees paid by employers. For example, a Kuwaiti employer might pay over 1,200 Kuwaiti Dinars (about Rs525,000) to Kuwait agencies to recruit a Nepali domestic worker, with more than 50 percent returning to Nepal and sharing among various actors. Agents sometimes offer women’s families lump sums (from Rs10,000 to Rs70,000) for selecting them. In other cases, women pay to migrate via tourist visas from Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu.This illicit migration increases vulnerability to strandedness in transit spaces and weakens Nepali domestic workers' bargaining power in the international labour market. The perception of 'illegal' slapped on Nepali domestic workers by their own government and embassies invites abuse and exploitation by agents and employers, even though most legally enter foreign countries. While some employers and agents act fairly, the migration ban grants others the impunity to control, discipline, and even punish Nepali domestic workers as they see fit. Many of these agents work for 971 registered recruitment agencies in Nepal. According to one ‘ethical agency’ representative, recruitment agencies must deposit a hefty ‘guarantee money’ into state coffers, which the government sometimes use to compensate the exploited labour. As a result, they fear that lifting the ban on domestic work will thrust the burden of ensuring labour rights onto them—a burden they feel ill-equipped to handle. They dread that allowing migration for domestic work could drive many licensed recruitment agencies to bankruptcy or, at worst, result in blacklisting.Civil society organisations Civil society organisations amplify the fear of domestic worker exploitation by spotlighting selective cases of exploitation and abuse. This outcry, often sensationalised with terms like ‘modern slaves’ imposed by Western funders, is fuelled under the guise of anti-trafficking and domestic work advocacy. This allows them to showcase (if not sell) women's suffering and leverage selective cases to further their agendas.A pressing question raised by research participants is: Why do these organisations, which run anti-migration campaigns and block mobility at the Indo-Nepal borders often fail to provide essential alternative employment opportunities? We found significant distrust in these organisations, which receive substantial funding from sources with political agendas—ranging from anti-immigration to anti-sex work, and religious perpetuation—while discouraging or denying women's mobility and rights.At least two types of organisations benefit from the ban. First, anti-trafficking NGOs, which employ fear-based awareness campaigns, discipline rescued women in their rehabilitation centres, detain and deport (intercept) aspiring women from Indo-Nepal borders to the very communities and families they try to escape. Whilst many women resist these anti-trafficking measures, some efforts often decay, threatening to tear apart the fabric of their communities. The second group comprises organisations that advocate for domestic workers, often referring to vulnerable Nepali returnees as their ‘clients’. Some of these organisations’ staff go to the airport at night to ‘rescue’ poor-looking returnee women. They take these women to their shelter homes, subject them to questioning and profiling, and send them back to their communities. Many women interviewed express fear of people they meet at the airport, noting that avoiding them is crucial to protect themselves and their agents from potential trouble. While many returnee migrant domestic workers need support, it should come from the government, with proper ethical considerations that do not exploit their vulnerability by treating them as 'clients'. The fierce competition for funding leads to a lack of cooperation and coordination, producing repetitive 'rescue' and ‘interception’ data shown only to donors. This data, fixated on negative migration outcomes, overlooks the countless domestic workers who have had positive migration experiences.From restrictions to rightsThe Government of Nepal often bases its restrictive policies on sensationalised news, diplomatic consultations, and skewed data that depict domestic work negatively. This approach allows the government to absolve itself of responsibility for its most vulnerable citizens, disregarding their rights while punishing them.Many returnee domestic workers report that seeking help from the Nepali embassy for labour exploitation is almost impossible, forcing them to arrange their own rescue. Some pay local agents (sometimes their elected representatives), while others pay recruitment agencies abroad, which can lead to raids and prolonged jail terms. When domestic workers die, their body repatriation often relies on the Nepali diaspora or NGO funding in Nepal. If these women return alive, they do not find any sustainable reintegration infrastructure developed by the government that specifically addresses their needs.Hence, the migration ban shifts the burden away from the government of Nepal, allowing it to abandon the rights of its poorest female citizens. Whilst other countries are willing to negotiate the rights of Nepali domestic workers, the government’s lack of political will betrays Nepal’s most vulnerable, prioritising the interests of benefiting actors over the rights of its people. Hence, it is time to immediately lift the migration ban on domestic work, strictly regulate the actors benefiting from these restrictive policies, and urgently begin negotiations with receiving countries to ensure the rights of hundreds of thousands of Nepali citizens. \nOli and Deuba formed a secret midnight deal to oust Prachanda as Prime Minister, driven by Oli's ambition, Deuba's strategy, and a lack of democratic control in the major political parties.\nNepal's women's volleyball team defeated India, reached the finals, despite societal barriers, highlighting their success in sports, particularly in football and volleyball, despite gender disparities in pay and infrastructure.\nThe taskforce of the three major political parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre—formed to find meeting points on the contentious provisions of the bill to amend the transitional justice-related law has submitted its report to the chiefs of three parties. The points of the agreement forged by the three-member panel were informally made public last week. Again, most notably, on Wednesday the chiefs of all three parties jointly accepted the report and unequivocally committed to resolving the remaining task of the peace process. After getting the report, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli vowed to expedite the bill and endorse it from Parliament without any further ado and then to swiftly implement it. In the prime minister’s words, this time, the amendment to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act would be meaningful and the ‘remnants of the conflict’ will be dealt with once and for all. Chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who led the decade-long Maoist insurgency, and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, sounded as committed to finding closure. Much optimism based just on Nepali leaders’ words may not be warranted. But, at times, important political achievements have been possible when leaders of these three parties have joined hands. Signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, management of arms and army of the Maoist party, constitution promulgation in 2015, among other knotty issues related to the peace process, took place based on such understanding among these forces. A major but crucial task that remains pending is delivery of justice to the victims, as envisioned in the CPA all those years ago. Of the three parties, Dahal of the Maoist Centre and Nepali Congress’ Deuba often felt put under pressure to swiftly conclude the peace process, as these parties were directly engaged in the insurgency from opposite sides—much more than the UML. In the past when Deuba and Dahal tried to push the process, UML leaders appeared intent on hindering its progress, sometimes out of conviction and sometimes for purely political reasons. With Prime Minister Oli keen to conclude the process at a time of his government leadership, and Deuba and Dahal ready to capitalise on the rare opportunity, there could perhaps be no better time to take the peace process to its conclusion. That said, the agreement among the leaders of the three parties is not sufficient. They must not forget that all they are doing is ultimately aimed at the victims. If the victims feel they are not getting justice, completing the process would be meaningless. Many have found the provisions proposed by the three-member panel largely progressive and fair, but a section of victims are still dissatisfied with a few conditions. We urge the major politicians to strive to address the concerns of these holdout victims while giving final touches to the amendment bill. Trying to ram the bill through Parliament without such effort would be ill-advised. Addressing the concerns raised by the Supreme Court in its past decisions and winning the trust of the international community is as important. On the other hand, those advocating on the victims’ behalf would also do well not to seek a perfect solution to what is an inherently complex problem.  \nCPN-UML Chair and current Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is instinctively combative against anyone he sees as even remotely challenging his authority. Using his unmatched flair for Nepali idioms, he is a past master at verbally taking down the credibility of his political opponents. The good news for him is that after the exit from the UML of senior leaders like Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal in early 2021, Oli has near complete control over the party machinery. Yet the insecurity over the possible emergence of rival leaders apparently continues to gnaw at the septuagenarian leader. The much-discussed reentry of ex-Nepali President Bidya Devi Bhandari into the UML fold may have given Oli many sleepless nights. Bhandari is not his only headache. Speaking at a party meeting on Sunday, Oli warned the UML rank and file that no kind of factionalism would be tolerated in the party. He added, for good measure, that even though such diktats had been issued in the past, this time he was dead serious. But then the chairperson is himself being accused of promoting factionalism. For instance, Bishnu Paudel, a trusted lieutenant of Oli, was made the finance minister on top of his responsibility of monitoring the party’s organisational activities. But Prithivi Subba Gurung, the new minister of information and communication, who has often had testy ties with Oli, is now without any responsibility in the party. (Earlier, he used to lead the UML’s parliamentary affairs department.) The ‘burden’ of dual responsibilities is apparently fine for a leader close to the party chair, someone more distant cannot be similarly overburdened. While Oli spoke on Sunday, he was also hinting at the undesirability of other possible factions in his party. There seems to be great tussle between Pokharel and Paudel, two Oli stalwarts, for influence. Most recently, this was seen during the appointment of the chief minister of Lumbini Province, with Chet Nath Acharya (who is close to Pokharel) and Leela Giri (close to Paudel) duelling it out for the top job, with Acharya eventually coming out on top. This tussle seems to have displeased Oli, perhaps because it suggests even his close acolytes might not be under his total control.A degree of competition is not just desirable but healthy for political parties. Yet Oli is having none of it. He warned his party that the promotion of factional politics in the name of internal democracy is unacceptable. Factionalism and internal democracy are both anathema to Oli. Even while he may boast that he will run the party for another two decades, it is only natural for those in and outside the UML to think of his eventual successor as party chair. Only with the right kind of debate will the right candidate emerge. Trying to maintain complete control is one sure way to break the party, as Oli found out in 2021. It might have worked to his advantage back then, yet if something like that happens again, Oli’s political stature is sure to be diminished. Oli as the party’s custodian should be promoting healthy debates and discussions instead of trying to stifle dissent. As the undisputed leader of the UML, he has everything to gain by adopting this more democratic approach to governance.    \nThe ripples of Nepal’s political instability are far-reaching, extending beyond its border. Soon after a government falls and a new prime minister assumes office, provincial leaders are toppled, senior bureaucrats are transferred, and ministers are changed—and so are the ambassadors. Little do our leaders seem to care how detrimental the coming and going of envoys is for the country’s image. The new coalition government headed by KP Oli has recently finalised the names of 19 envoys to serve in different capitals. The ambassadors appointed by the previous coalition under Pushpa Kamal Dahal were recalled. Only time will tell the fate of the new appointees, as we cannot say how long the incumbent government will last. Recalling envoys en masse every time there is a government change is not conducive for a country like Nepal that is having to maintain an increasingly difficult balance between major powers like India, China and the US. Ambassadors, when appointed to a new place, need some time to familiarise themselves with their new environment. But if they are replaced no sooner than they are appointed, the very purpose of diplomacy is lost. Half of Nepal’s ambassadors are political appointees and the rest are career diplomats. The political appointments in particular are problematic. Krishna Prasad Oli, a close associate of the prime minister, has been picked as the ambassador to China. (His main coalition partner, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Nepali Congress chief, also undoubtedly got to have his say in other picks.) Oli’s envoys are predominantly so-called upper-caste men, with only four women and not a single Dalit ambassador nominee. There also seems to be little forethought on when and when not to recall ambassadors. Take the case of Shankar Sharma, Nepal’s former ambassador to India. Appointed by Deuba in March 2022 when he was in a coalition with Dahal, Sharma was recalled when Dahal allied with Oli to form a new government back in March this year. He has been reappointed after coming to power of the UML-Congress coalition. This kind of immature diplomacy with a country as important as India will do great harm to Nepal’s interests. Experts have suggested increasing the proportion of career diplomats as ambassadors from the current 50 percent to 80 or 90 percent. That will apparently decrease political meddling in the process. Perhaps an even better idea is to pick ambassadors, at least to important capitals like New Delhi, Beijing and Washington DC, on the basis of broad political understanding. After all, even if there is a change in government, a combination of the same two or three parties will come to power. If that is the case, why not make these picks judiciously through political consultations and let the ambassadors work for their full four-year term? That would also be in keeping with our national interest. One thing that can be done to ensure that the right people are picked is to make the nominees undergo a rigorous parliamentary vetting process. Up until now, such hearings for ambassador picks have been no more than rituals. But as we recently saw in the case of Krishna Man Pradhan, someone charged with sexual exploitation who was nominated as election commissioner, the parliamentary hearing process can be quite effective in keeping out the bad eggs. Again, in these testing times around the world for international relations and diplomacy, Nepal cannot afford to continue with its current ad hoc approach. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nMonsoon-induced disasters in Nepal have killed many despite advancements in forecasting technology due to insufficient stations, lack of expertise, and the rapid pace of climate change, necessitating organizational restructuring and updated policies to protect lives.\nNepali Congress and CPN-UML formed a government, ousting Pushpa Kamal Dahal as PM, raising concerns about the weakening of progressive agendas. The Maoist Centre, criticized for losing its moral authority and connection with the working class, faces an existential crisis while the UML and other forces attempt to fill the void.\nThroughout the weekend, Nepal experienced partly cloudy conditions with varying degrees of rainfall, ranging from light to heavy, accompanied by thunder and lightning, across different provinces.\nRain, thunderstorms, and possible heavy rainfall are expected in several provinces of Nepal, with moderate temperatures ranging from 15.0-34.4 degrees Celsius.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather is predicted nationwide with light to moderate rain and thunderstorms in several areas, including potential heavy rainfall in certain regions.\nMonsoon winds bring partly to generally cloudy weather with light to heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms in various provinces of Nepal.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNearly 1.5 million customers still don’t know why they have lost access to six dozen TV channels for the past two weeks, even though they have paid for them in advance.The channel distributors have blamed the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology for not recommending the foreign exchange facility to the Nepal Rastra Bank, while the ministry says no distributors have applied for it.Seventy-two channels under Sony, Star, Zee, and iCast banners have been off the air since August 1.The ministry said that the Nepali channel distributors hadn’t paid the Indian broadcaster for a year and a half, and the dues could amount to Rs1 billion. As a result, the Indian broadcaster has stopped channel distribution to Nepal.However, the Nepali channel distributors have raised all the money from Nepali customers in advance, and consumer rights activists say they have to compensate.Sudip Acharya, managing director of Dish Media Network, the operator of DishHome, a DTH and internet service provider in Nepal, said they had paid the Nepali distributors in advance after raising money from customers.“Now, we are under pressure from the customers. We are asking the distributors to return our payment.”An official of WorldLink Communications, Nepal’s largest internet service provider, said the issue could not be solved during the tenure of former communication minister Rekha Sharma and there are no signs of a solution anytime soon.There are seven local distributors. NETTV, one of the operators with 1.3 million customers, posted a message on its website: “Due to unexpected reasons, Indian Premium and International channels are currently deactivated, and they will be resumed soon. We will inform you as soon as the channels are restored.”Manish Singh, CEO of DMB Holdings, distributor of Star and Zee networks, said they had sent the details of the bill to the ministry in June, which includes recommendations for the foreign exchange facility from October 2023 to June 2024. “We don’t know why the ministry is dithering,” Singh said. “I have been making rounds at the ministry, but the officials are confused even though we have made full compliance with the à la carte system. The government imposed the rules in haste, and it is itself in a dilemma now,” he added. Most distributors, government officials, and internet service providers say that service will resume soon, but no one knows when. One official told the Post that the problem could linger. “We are in the process of solving the issue,” said Subodh Nepal, director of the Department of Information and Broadcasting. Even though the à la carte system, which allows viewers to pick the channels they want to watch and only pay for them, was implemented a year ago, Nepal said it took time for operators and broadcasters to fully implement it. Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation, a unified representative body of TV broadcasters and over-the-top platforms in India, cut the channel service in Nepal on August 1 due to non-payment of service dues.Nepal said there had been a dispute over payment between the government and broadcasters before as well as after the implementation of the à la carte system. The service providers usually apply to the department for payment, and the ministry recommends the foreign exchange facility.Officials said the local distributors created the problem, and they are not showing any interest in clearing the dues, as barely one or two distributors have come for the recommendation.The ministry has formed an informal committee to look into the issue and determine the exact dues that the distributors must pay.Gajendra Kumar Thakur, spokesperson for the communication ministry, said that despite collecting advance payments from customers, the distributors have not paid the broadcaster for over a year.“We will recommend the payment for any distributor who applies for the payment to the broadcaster,” Thakur said.In August last year, the communication ministry formally implemented the “pick-and-pay” option for Nepali television viewers. This allows viewers to watch their favourite channels and pay only for those rather than the whole package that includes channels they rarely watch. To cover carrying costs, the ministry of communications has fixed a minimum monthly fee of Rs250 per customer for cable television.It used to cost a customer around Rs1,000 a month to subscribe to the channels, but with the implementation of the à la carte system, it will cost no more than Rs470 a month even if the customer subscribes to all the channels, Thakur said.A total of 32 channels are broadcast under Star India, 21 under Sony Pictures, 15 under Indiacast Media Distribution, 10 under ZEE Entertainment, 14 under Discovery Network Asia Pacific, 5 under HBO, 1 under BBC Studio Distribution and 2 under channels under Bennet Coleman and Company.The cable operators can customise channels under the à la carte system and submit them for approval.Currently, TV channels are broadcast in Nepal through direct-to-home, multiple-system operators, multichannel multipoint distribution services, internet protocol television, and digital terrestrial television, among other methods.Consumer rights activists say that collecting payment in advance and depriving people of services is cheating and against the law.  \nIn Nepal on a ‘familiarisation’ visit, new Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had a hectic first day in Kathmandu. He paid a courtesy call on President Ramchandra Paudel on Sunday. During the meeting at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Sheetal Niwas, a number of topics related to bilateral relations and mutual interest were discussed.During the meeting, President Paudel stated that Nepal and India have to cooperate to minimise the effects of climate change.“Both countries must work together to reduce the effects of climate change since the safety of mankind depends on the safety of mountains and water,” Kiran Pokharel, the President’s press adviser, told the Post, quoting Paudel. President Paudel also said that Nepal and India have had a relationship from the time immemorial and acknowledged India’s big contribution to Nepal’s development. President Paudel mentioned that there is a lot of potential for hydropower development, sustainable and easy energy trade in Nepal.On the occasion, Indian Foreign Secretary Misri expressed his commitment to working together with Nepal as the issue of reducing the impact of climate change is a challenge for both the countries, says Pokharel.Quoting Misri, Pokharel further said, “Among the plans of the Nepal government, India would like to work on Nepal’s priorities such as energy, agriculture and tourism.”The visiting Indian foreign secretary also paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Sunday at Singha Durbar. During their meeting various matters of mutual interest were discussed, says the foreign ministry of Nepal. A source at the Prime Minister’s Office said that during the meeting Prime Minister Oli strongly urged that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi should soon visit Nepal. He also extended a formal invitation. Earlier, Indian Prime Minister Modi was expected to come to Nepal on one of the Mondays of Shawan to pay homage to Lord Pashupatinath. But that window closes in five days.During his first and second tenures, Indian Prime Minister Modi visited Nepal five times in total. After the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition got the majority in the 14th Lok Sabha election in June, Modi was appointed the prime minister of India for the third time. While Modi first became the prime minister in 2014, Oli became the prime minister of Nepal in 2015. During the second tenure of Modi, which started in 2019, Oli was against the prime minister, following the 2017 elections. Relations between the two countries are at present considered to be at a low, according to experts.Earlier in 2018, Indian Prime Minister Modi had visited Nepal at the invitation of Oli the prime minister.This is a familiarisation visit of Secretary Misri, said spokesperson for the foreign ministry in Kathmandu Amrit Rai. “Therefore, no issues other than those of bilateral interest were discussed.”However, Rai refused to categorically mention the issues of mutual interest. Oli, who became prime minister on July 12, will be in Thailand as his first foreign trip after being appointed the prime minister. He is scheduled to attend the sixth summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) starting September 4.Nepal and Thailand are also working to make Prime Minister Oli’s visit bilateral. After Thailand, Prime Minister Oli will take part in the 79th session of the United National General Assembly in September. The Prime Minister’s Office claimed that both India and China had invited Prime Minister Oli. Indian Foreign Secretary Misri, apart from President Paudel and Prime Minister Oli, also met Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba at his residence in Budhanilkantha. Among other things, they discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations, according to a press release issued after the meeting.Also on Sunday Misri also paid a courtesy call on CPN (Maoist Centre) chair and former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. During the meeting both sides discussed issues of mutual interest, said Dahal’s personal secretary Ramesh Malla.“Since it was an introductory visit, the discussion was casual,” Malla told the Post. The visiting foreign secretary reportedly vowed to work on the agreement reached between the two countries when Dahal was the prime minister.When Dahal visited India as the prime minister of Nepal in June 2023, India had agreed to import 10,000 MW of hydroelectricity from Nepal.Indian Secretary Misri came to Kathmandu on a two-day visit at the invitation of Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal. Misri was welcomed by his Nepali counterpart Lamsal at the Tribhuvan International Airport.Misri took up his new role last month, succeeding Vinay Mohan Kwatra, who served as Indian ambassador to Nepal from March 2020 to April 2022. Misri undertook his first familiarisation visit, to Bhutan, on July 18.Foreign ministry officials said that it is customary for new foreign secretaries to tour South Asian countries after assuming office to update themselves and assess bilateral relations. Before being promoted to Indian foreign secretary, Misri served as deputy national security adviser of India.The 59-year-old has a distinguished career, having served as private secretary to three prime ministers—Inder Kumar Gujral in 1997, Manmohan Singh in 2012, and Narendra Modi in 2014.Known as a China expert within the Indian foreign policy establishment, Misri was India’s ambassador to China (2019-2021) and played a key role in India-China negotiations following the 2020 Galwan Valley clashes that resulted from the actions of the Chinese military in eastern Ladakh.Misri also inaugurated the new building of the Nepal Bhasha Parishad in Kathmandu. The building, located in Naradevi, was built with the assistance from India’s post-earthquake reconstruction grant. After an introductory meeting with Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba on Monday, Misri will return to India. \nAt the Dhulikhel Hospital in Kavrepalanchok, the suggestion box is overflowing with complaints of rude behaviour.People are unhappy not only with doctors, nurses and paramedics serving at the hospital, but also with security guards, administrative staff and those manning the hospital’s ticket counter.“Sometimes, the behaviour of health workers and other staffers towards patients and their visitors escalates and leads to conflicts,” said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, administrative head of the Hospital. “The issue is not just the complaints made by the patients and their visitors, hospital officials have also noticed behavioural problems among health workers and other staffers.”To address growing complaints from patients and visitors, the hospital administration has decided to impart behavioural and communication skills training to its entire staffers, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and others.Officials hope this training will help lessen the growing grievances.“Proper communication and good behaviour are essential for all hospital staff including doctors,” said Dr Karmacharya. “These skills are also taught in universities and medical courses, but it seems some health workers have not paid much attention to these basics. Patients and their visitors should be treated like a hotel treats its guests.”Experts say complaints about rude behaviour are not only limited to any particular hospital but are prevalent across almost all hospitals in Nepal. Due to a lack of proper communication and behavioural skills, reports of scuffles between hospitals or doctors and the relatives of deceased patients take place frequently. Sometimes, these situations also take a nasty turn and doctors have been manhandled and hospitals vandalised. These disputes have also escalated into shutdown of the healthcare facilities, protests by health workers, and a halt in services.“Colleges under the Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine teach communication skills to the students of medicine,” said Dr Jagdish Prasad Agrawal, retired dean of the Institute of Medicine. “Although communication skills are part of the curriculum and a basic requirement for any health professional, it seems that many have not paid much attention to these skills.”Good communication skills and respectful behaviour are crucial for health workers, regardless of their other profession skills, officials at the Nepal Medical Council, the national regulatory body of medical doctors, said.They said that health workers can foster a positive environment in hospitals and improve interactions with patients and their relatives. “People in every profession need good communication skills, and those serving in the medical sector need them the most,” said Dr Bishwa Raj Dawadi, member of the Council. “The Council often receives complaints about doctors’ rude behaviour.”The council has made professional development training that includes communication skills mandatory for all medical doctors. Failure to attend the course will lead to non-renewal of the medical licence.As per the council’s rule, medical doctors must undertake this training regularly. The council assesses the effectiveness of the training every five years to ensure that medical doctors are up-to-date in their profession.Patients have to wait in long queues in state-run health facilities to see a doctor. Visitors of every patient expect immediate care, as they think that the problems of their patients are more serious than others’. Dawadi said that the success of health workers depends not only on the care they provide but also on their communication with patients.“To lessen risk of getting assaulted or mistreated by patients and their visitors, health workers, including doctors, must be good communicators,” said Dawadi. “Other hospitals should also provide communication and behaviour training to their staff.” \nNepal’s long-distance runner Santoshi Shrestha finished the Paris Olympics women’s marathon in the 79th position on Sunday.Shrestha took 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds to complete the 42.195km distance.A total of 91 athletes had competed in the women’s marathon, the last athletics event in Paris. Eleven athletes did not finish the race.Shrestha, however, could not beat her own personal best. She had won a gold medal in the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon with a time of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, setting a new national record.Shrestha was representing Nepal in the women’s marathon on the Olympics stage for the first time in 28 years. She is the fourth athlete from Nepal to compete in the women’s marathon at the Olympics.Last time, Bimala Rana Magar represented Nepal in the women’s marathon at Atlanta 1996. Nepal first sent its athletes in the women's marathon at Seoul 1988 when Raj Kumari Pandey and Menuka Rawat had taken part. Since Sydney 2000, Nepal has been participating only in short and middle distance events in women’s athletics.On Sunday, Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands won the gold in an Olympic record of 2 hours 22 minutes and 55 seconds. The Dutch had come into the marathon roughly 35 hours after shooting to bronze medals in 5,000m and 10,000m.Ethiopian Tigst Assefa won silver medal with a timing of 2:22.58 and Kenya's Hellen Obiri claimed bronze clocking 2:23.10.The current world record of 2:16:16 in women’s marathon is held by Kenya’s Peres Jepchirchir, which she set at the London Marathon in April this year.Shrestha was the last of the seven athletes from Nepal at the Paris 2024. Swimmers Alexander Shah set a national record in men’s 100m freestyle in Paris. Shah swam the distance in 51.91 seconds to improve his own previous record of 52.17 set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar. Shah finished third in his Heat and 59th overall among 79 swimmers, failing to progress into the semi-finals.Duana Lama also crashed out of the Heat stage in the women’s 200 m freestyle event as she finished last in the Heat 1 and 30th overall among 31 participants. Her time of 2 minutes 20.74 seconds could not even beat her previous best of 2 minutes 12.46 seconds. Gaurika Singh holds the national record in the women’s 200 m freestyle with 2:11.94 seconds.Badminton star Prince Dahal was eliminated from the men’s singles group stage. He suffered defeats to eventual gold medallist Viktor Axelson of Denmark, Ireland’s Nhat Nguyen, and Israel’s Misa Zilberman.Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha was knocked out from the preliminary round after he lost his men’s singles match to Senegal’s Ibrahima Diaw 12-10, 11-3, 11-4, 11-5. Santoo is the only third Nepali player to have qualified for the Olympics through a selection tournament after Sangina Baidya (Athens 2004) and Deepak Bista (Beijing 2008).Paris 2024 also marked Nepal’s debut in badminton and table tennis.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan could not progress from the first round as she lost her women’s 57 kg weight category Elimination round of 32 Pool A bout to Marcia Perisic of Serbia by ippon.Shooter Sushmita Nepal exited the Paris Olympics after finishing 42nd in the women’s 10 m air rifle qualification event. \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nThe luxurious new life of Pushpa Kamal Dahal is an antithesis of his younger days when he took up arms for the sake of the marginalised and downtrodden sections of society. As the leader of a bloody insurgency that claimed nearly 17,000 lives, Dahal has always had a legion of detractors. But when he first came out of the jungles to join mainstream politics, he also had a lot of public support, as was evident from the 220 seats his party won in the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The Maoist tally was double the number of the second-placed Nepali Congress, as the party got nearly 30 percent of all cast votes. By the time of the 2022 national elections, it had to be satisfied with 32 seats and just around 14 percent of the votes. The reason for this steady erosion in the party’s electoral support is clear enough. Primarily, it is a reflection of Dahal forgetting his roots. He is today no different to the ‘crony capitalists’ of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML he once blamed for all the country’s woes. There is now not a ‘progressive’ bone in his body. Yet following his ignominious exit as prime minister a month ago, Dahal has been in a hurry to put together a progressive alliance of socialist and left-learning forces. He is already in the four-party Socialist Front which, besides the Maoist Centre, also has as its members the CPN (Unified Socialist), the Nepal Socialist Party and the Communist Party of Nepal. The Maoist chief wants to further expand the collaboration between such like-minded forces. Moreover, his Maoist Centre party has announced a new nationwide campaign whereby it will go to people’s doorsteps to explain the party’s agendas and to get feedback. The feedback is likely to be angry. The party has long since abandoned its principled advocacy on behalf of women, Dalits, Janjatis and other marginalised communities—the groups that were its core voters. As things stand, on the right of the political centre in Nepal there is the Congress while the UML occupies the left of the centre. The people disenchanted with both these outfits are plumping for new forces like the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Janamat Party. Where in this political spectrum does today’s toothless Maoist party fit, one wonders. People won’t also be fooled by the formation of so-called leftist and socialist fronts. Dahal seems to remember his once core constituencies only when he is out of power. Disenchantment against him is growing, even within the Maoist Centre. After a long while, other party leaders are openly criticising his undisguised lust for power, most evident in his oscillation between the Congress and the UML just so he could occupy the prime minister’s chair. Some, like Narayan Kaji Shrestha and Janardan Sharma, have asked him to make way for a new leader. If Dahal is serious about reviving his party’s fortunes and leaving behind a credible legacy, he should be the one to make the most of the sacrifice. The options before him are limited. Gone are the days his gift of the gab alone could change people’s hearts and minds.  \nIn January 2022, I was brainstorming with a few friends to pool funds together—a crowdfunding of sorts—to make a political movie or web series. My point was that Nepal didn’t have many political movies that inspired politicians or aspiring politicians—instead, most movies portrayed politicians as dishonest people, if not downright criminals. To be fair, being a politician anywhere in the world is difficult. The unpaid hours, days, weeks and years you put into this endeavour without any certainty of ever coming to power would deter most people from ever coming close to this field.So, the idea behind the movie was to show that despite the very constraining environment Nepali politicians operate in, they can still make everyday decisions in the larger public interest. The story was to be something similar to “The West Wing” with a Nepali twist. This discussion took place several months before the election of Balen Shah and Harka Sampang and almost a year before the rise of Rabi Lamichhane and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The project failed to take off as we disagreed on the plot, and the dramatic rise of Balen and others stole the thunder from some project elements.The hook I had in mind was the emergence of a relatively unknown leader from within the system. The movie would open with breaking news that two ‘co-pilots’ of the then Communist Party of Nepal agreed to step aside in favour of a relatively unknown young leader as the next prime minister. The movie was to focus on this new leader rising to the occasion and delivering on public priorities even as the old guards in the party tried to stifle the reforms. The movie was to end in a cliffhanger with the new prime minister calling for a referendum for a directly elected PM. The parliament blocks this move, and the Supreme Court rules in favour of the premier.A positive political movie that showcases political disruption from within the existing system could inspire reform-minded politicians while giving hope to the audience in general. As a political reporter, I have observed many leaders closely; they are generally not bad people. They are confined in the vicious cycle of their own making. They start their day very early as constituents seek help and favours. The expenses for tea, snacks and even lunches are steep. Then, there is the need to be relevant within the party to get tickets or be considered for party positions or public offices. Finally, you must raise funds to win elections and cover other expenses. Once they get elected, recouping these investments takes precedence over public service. This is the plight of mid-level leaders. Those at the top have their tasks cut out, too. Managing the party is equivalent to making deals with different leaders to be at the helm. If you are in a position to form the government, your art of deal-making must be at a different high. It takes different skill sets, from keeping the coalitions intact to doling out limited plum positions to unlimited aspirants from the party and coalitions.In such a constraining environment, politicians in Nepal can barely keep their heads above water. They are drowning in the system they have designed. They have no time to think about delivering on their election manifestos, let alone their personal legacy.Reform from withinOne way to ease the pressure is to amend the constitution to allow a directly elected prime minister, among other things. This would mean that the old guards might lose control over the system. But what is the use of a system that keeps the guards themselves as prisoners and forces them to engage in an endless Sisyphean exercise?What happened in Sri Lanka in July 2022 and Bangladesh earlier this month foreshadows a larger regional political trend. While in contrast to much of the region, Nepal hasn’t seen the same level of democratic backsliding, the record on other aspects of governance is dismal. True, there is ample space for expressing discontent. But that is no consolation for the rising frustration over the lack of jobs and systemic unfairness for people without political connections. For instance, small businesses have seen a significant surge in what often appears like competing taxation from all three tiers of government, even as the business ecosystem continues to deteriorate. This will force more businesses to pull their shutters down, reducing the availability of already limited jobs in the market.Nepal has a history of frequent uprisings and regime changes, often occurring every decade or two. By that standard, another uprising is overdue now. Nepali politicians must accept that they failed to innovate and deliver if they want to avoid a fate similar to that of their regional counterparts. They need to initiate necessary constitutional reforms. Frequent overhauling of the political system on the wave of a political uprising doesn’t resolve the underlying issue: General incompetence, reluctance to admit failures and seek help, and the misguided belief that sacrifices made for the democratic movement absolve them of all shortcomings. While the current constitution has flaws, the bigger flaws lie in the character and content of our politics. If the general discontent is to be managed and another uprising prevented, Nepali leaders need to show that the current system can absorb both incremental and dramatic changes.Several smaller parties have already called for constitutional amendments—on issues ranging from secularism and inclusion to governance structure. It is high time that a national dialogue and referendum be held on some of these contentious issues before momentum builds against the current system and its keepers. Political uprisings are disruptive and, at times, have a tragic habit of being hijacked by other interest groups—leaving the public worse off than before. \nThe dramatic turn of events in Bangladesh has shocked many people. But the story, for the Nepalis, is all too familiar. Nepali political leaders, including former monarchs, have not differed from the deposed Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. All of them have blurred the thin line between democracy and autocracy and between good governance and misrule. What is even more striking is the role of India and questions about its foreign policy.India’s “pragmatic” foreign policy was, to a large extent, responsible for emboldening Hasina’s autocratic tendencies, making her impervious to the demands of democracy and the growing aspirations of the new generation.Given Bangladesh’s location and strategic importance, India had multiple overriding concerns and security imperatives.Hasina became India’s trusted ally. Given her historical and personal relations with India, it was easier for her to sympathise with them. India’s support for Hasina and the Awami League (AL) appears logical, given the fact that her party has served India’s strategic and economic interests. However, in the last round of elections, Bangladeshi people perceived that India had openly sided with the AL. India tried to convince the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party to take part in the elections but without success. India then supported AL’s attempt to hold the elections against the wishes of the larger civil society in Bangladesh. As a result, the voter turnout was very low and widespread irregularities were reported.Despite Western countries like the US expressing concerns about the legitimacy of the elections, India was instrumental in facilitating legitimacy to the sham election results. Growing disenchantment with Hasina gave a fillip to anti-India sentiments among the people. India’s foreign policy, in the last decade, has tried to recast itself in terms of pragmatism and flexibility, focused solely on India’s strategic interests. In his book, The India Way, India’s Minister of External Affairs, S Jaishankar, explains the idea of “Krishna’s Choice” as being undeterred by the collateral consequences. This means focusing on the self-defined “righteous” goals rather than on the righteousness of the means. Adopting such a foreign policy disregards the pervasiveness of anti-India sentiments in South Asia. As per Jaishankar’s philosophy, India does not need to be popular, it just needs to secure its interests.Such thinking is reasonable. Despite a significant level of anti-India sentiment in South Asia, India’s power and presence remain substantial. It has learnt to secure its interests, in spite of hostile governments.However, if India wants to claim leadership as a regional power in South Asia and beyond, stand up to global norms, and maintain stability in the region, it must adopt democracy as a pillar of its foreign policy. India’s foreign policy goals must align with the neighbourhood’s broader interests, particularly democracy and economic development.Without aligning with democracy, “pragmatism” in its foreign policy can only deliver short-term tactical gains that may quickly be overturned. On the other hand, prioritising democratic values and putting the interests of the people rather than the governments can become a long-term evolutionarily stable strategy.Perspectives from Nepal may offer some insights into India’s growing role in the region and how people from Nepal view India’s foreign policy.From a Nepali perspective, India’s foreign policy, in its current state, is problematic. For example, in recent years, India has not hesitated to empower Nepali politics and politicians that have hampered democratic values, promoted inequality and harmed people’s interests.India has been conducting its foreign policy in Nepal in three prominent ways. The first is by engaging with the government, whatever the propensity of the ruling regime and using all available leverages and powers to ensure that the party in power remains “friendly.” This strategy has often hampered the efforts of the Nepali people to democratise the parties and the country. India’s emphasis on this method has given rise to anti-Indianism as a political platform and as a feature of public psychology.There is also a more sinister Cold War era style of engagement. In engaging with Nepal’s political parties and ruling regimes, India has frequently resorted to its intelligence wings, whose brash and open interventions have amplified anti-India sentiments and spread them to the grassroots level. Every new government in Nepal seeks India’s support to ensure its longevity. In a recent closed-door conversation, senior party leaders told us that during state visits, Nepali prime ministers are under tremendous pressure to demonstrate that India supports them and that their visit is a success. They fear that without India’s support no government can expect to be durable.Another way India has cashed in is by supporting political movements. This has also had mixed results. When India sided with Nepal’s democratic forces against the King in 1989-90 as well as in 2005, it enraged the monarchist and nationalist forces. Similarly, in 2015, when it sided with the Madhesh movement, it angered the hill people and hill-centric parties, propelling them closer to China.The third way India has conducted its bilateral relations is through connectivity and development diplomacy. India has gradually achieved “irreversible” bilateral relations with Nepal through the strategy of improved connectivity, trade and economic integration. For example, in recent years, India and Nepal have worked on Integrated Check Posts (ICPs), hydro-power projects, petroleum pipelines, payment gateways and transmission lines. These forms of connectivity are gradually making it more difficult for Nepal to swing between India and China as in the past.In order to sustain its gains, India must demonstrate that its values align with the interests of democracy and the aspirations of the younger generation in the neighbourhood. Such values extend to economic equality, human rights, justice, identity politics and secularism. Unfortunately, the impact of the Indian government’s association with the Hindutva movement has spilled over borders; it has alienated Muslim populations in the neighbourhood, including in Nepal and Bangladesh. The case of Bangladesh also shows that if Hasina had strengthened democratic values and institutions, the social order in Bangladesh would not have come under strain even now.Another major factor why India must emphasise democracy and align itself to people’s interests in South Asia is the presence of China.China is waiting on the sidelines, biding its time, ready to pounce on the opportunities missed by India. Experts and policymakers in India do not believe China can gain access to the Indian market, given the current state of Sino-India relations and border disputes. But China is not fazed. It is confident that it has secured its interest in Tibet vis-à-vis Nepal. Now, it has its eyes on the Indian market. China’s persistence in investing in border infrastructure in Tibet, as well as in the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, shows its long-term strategy and confidence in its ability to gain access to South Asia.Khanal is Research Director at CESIF Nepal, a foreign policy think tank, and former Chief Editor of Ukaalo. \nFor decades, the primary goal of transport systems has been to move as much motorised traffic as quickly as possible from point A to point B. However, focusing on motorised vehicular traffic has made the transport sector one of the largest contributors to global emissions, producing significant levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.Consequently, modern transport planning, design and operations are increasingly driven by concerns about adopting greener, more sustainable systems that reduce emissions, improve public health and minimise costs. This new paradigm focuses on transport decarbonisation strategies to combat global warming and emphasises a people-centric approach. It prioritises populations having access to efficient, safe and inclusive transport for a wide variety of trip purposes.How to attract pedestriansThis shift aims to improve transport options and reduce both the frequency and overall distance of trips taken by motorbike or car, by promoting walking as the primary transport model. The interplay between land use, urban design, and road infrastructure design is critical in creating walkable environments.Efficient land-use planning can create compact, higher-density and mixed-use neighbourhoods where amenities and services are within walking distance (e.g., 15-minute city). Good urban design fosters walkability by prioritising human-scale development. This includes designing streetscapes and creating attractive public spaces, parks and amenities that are visually appealing and functional for pedestrians.Features such as building orientation, street furniture (like benches, water fountains and rubbish bins), wayfinding signage and landscaping play significant roles in making streets more inviting and functional, enhancing pedestrians' walking experience.Road infrastructure should be designed to enhance connectivity, accessibility and pedestrian safety by providing wide, well-maintained footpaths and creating direct, continuous paths free from obstructions between key destinations. To ensure pedestrians' safety and comfort, adequate lighting should be provided to enhance visibility and reduce the risk of accidents. Additionally, refuge islands and raised crosswalks can shorten distances, while frequent pedestrian crossings improve accessibility and convenience.Smart infrastructureTechnology including smart infrastructure, data analytics and digital mapping and navigation can significantly enhance infrastructure design and promote walkability. Smart infrastructure that integrates sensors and smart technologies can improve the efficiency and safety of pedestrian pathways. For example, smart traffic lights that adjust based on pedestrian flow can reduce waiting times and enhance safety.Collecting and analysing data on pedestrian movement patterns can help urban planners identify high-footfall areas and prioritise improvements. In addition, walking can be more appealing when detailed maps and navigation tools that highlight pedestrian-friendly routes and amenities are provided.Integrating walking with other modes of transport through Mobility as a Service platforms that provide real-time information about public transport options and their proximity to walkable routes can create seamless travel experiences using a variety of different modes of transport and facilitate more sustainable travel choices. The connection between good pedestrian infrastructure and increased public transport usage is evident by the study conducted in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur. Improving walkability in already developed, car-dependent neighbourhoods and cities requires a multifaceted approach.It requires retrofitting infrastructure, revising zoning policies and implementing placemaking.Retrofitting roadsExisting streets can be retrofitted by using a road diet approach. This involves reducing the number of lanes dedicated to cars to widen footpaths and make room for green spaces. Implementing local area traffic management and traffic calming measures such as speed bumps, narrower lanes and roundabouts to reduce vehicle speeds are also strategies to retrofit existing streets to enhance pedestrian safety and encourage walking.Revising zoning codes to allow for higher density and mixed-use developments can be achieved by repurposing existing—and potentially underutilised—spaces for new uses that can serve also as attractive destinations for walking. For example, converting parking lots into pedestrian-friendly areas with shops, cafes, community gardens and parks. Or converting and repurposing old factories or historic buildings near public transport hubs into community centres or mixed-use developments.To achieve the best results, land use and space conversion can be integrated with the placemaking process that focuses on creating vibrant, engaging public spaces by adding amenities like seating, lighting, public art and landscaping that reflect community needs and foster social interaction.A walkability assessment based on a place's walkability score—a multidimensional index assessing the pedestrian-friendliness of a location—is used to objectively assess walking-related strategies. Such assessments can be further improved by using advanced AI-based image processing techniques to provide valuable insights into how pedestrians perceive safety and comfort.Such tools can also automate the analysis of Google Street View data, allowing transport planners to identify trends and patterns in pedestrian perception across different urban areas. This data-driven approach helps prioritise improvements, targeted interventions and policy decisions aimed at enhancing walkability, fostering healthier lifestyles and reducing reliance on cars and other forms of motorised transport.Enhancing walkability is a powerful strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating healthier, more vibrant and more sustainable urban communities. By integrating thoughtful land use planning, urban design, and road infrastructure improvements and leveraging technology, cities can foster walkable environments that benefit both people and the planet.Susilawati is a senior lecturer in the School of Engineering at Monash University Malaysia.-360info \nMovie star Tom Cruise rappelled from the roof of France’s national stadium and received the Olympic flag, bringing a heavy dose of Hollywood to the closing ceremony of the Paris Games as the French capital handed over to the next host Los Angeles.Grammy-winning R&B artist H.E.R teased the Mission Impossible soundtrack as Cruise made his leap, drawing gasps from spectators as he dropped 50 metres to the floor of the Stade de France, in the finale to a ceremony that blended the traditional, the obscure and the razzle dazzle of Tinseltown.While Paris used iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Versailles to win the hearts of Olympians and spectators alike, LA was swift to turn to its star draw: A-list celebrities.Paris was bringing down the curtain on an Olympic Games that brought scintillating sport to the heart of the capital, breathing new life into an Olympic brand hurt by the difficulties of Rio de Janeiro’s 2016 Games and the soulless spirit of Tokyo’s COVID-hit event.Even Parisians were carried away by the Olympic fervour.“We wanted to dream. We got Leon Marchand,” Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet told the crowd, referring to the French swimmer who won four golds.“From one day to the next Paris became a party and France found itself. From a country of grumblers, we became a country of frenzied fans.”‘CULTURE OF PEACE’The two weeks of sporting drama saw China and the United States duke it out for top spot in the medal table right down to the last event.Echoing the heartache delivered to France by the United States in the men’s basketball final, the American women’s basketball side handed France a gut-wrenching one-point defeat to earn a 40th gold medal and top spot on the medal table.As the world emerged from the COVID pandemic in 2022, Paris had promised an Olympic “light at the end of the tunnel” and to provide the stage for a carefree Games.But Russia’s war in Ukraine on Europe’s eastern flank, conflict in the Middle East, and France’s heightened state of security alert loomed large as the Games got under way.International Committee President Thomas Bach saluted the athletes as he declared the Games closed.“During all this time, you lived peacefully together under one roof in the Olympic Village. You embraced each other,” Bach said. “You respected each other, even if your countries are divided by war and conflict. You created a culture of peace.”HIGH BAR FOR LOS ANGELESCruise’s exit on a motorbike saw the closing ceremony transition to a prerecorded video of the 62-year-old skydiving down to the Hollywood sign, where a wide shot showed the Olympic rings incorporated into the LA landmark.The flag was then passed from U.S. Olympians past and present as it traversed the city before reaching a beach party, where the LA music icons the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, and Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre performed.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has acknowledged Paris has set a high standard. But the City of Angels has billed itself as a beacon of diversity and will have Hollywood to fall back on.“They’ve got a high bar to reach. A lot of work to do,” said James Rutledge, 59, a former banker wearing a Team USA t-shirt outside the Stade de France. “Hollywood next? That’s something to play with.”SPORTING MEMORIESFrance will take away fond sporting memories.The French had a new golden boy to celebrate with swimmer Marchand emerging as the king of the pool, before French judoka Teddy Riner reigned supreme as he claimed his fifth Olympic gold medal.Simone Biles put her twisties misery of Tokyo behind her, making a long-awaited Olympic return in front of a star-studded crowd. She arrived the world’s most decorated gymnast and left with a further three gold medals for her trophy cabinet.Breaking made its Olympic debut - to some derision on social media - whilst 3x3 basketball, sports climbing, skateboarding and surfing made their second appearances.The IOC will be relieved that no major scandals erupted, although it did have to grapple with some controversies.A simmering doping row involving Chinese athletes hung over the Olympic swimming meet where the United States faced the biggest challenge to their reign in decades.A storm around gender eligibility hit the women’s boxing competition, revealing the toxic relations between the IOC and a widely discredited International Boxing Association.Meanwhile, a $1.5 billion clean-up of the Seine rewarded Paris with the optics of triathlon and marathon swimmers competing in the river through central Paris, without a wave of illness ensuing. \nEight members of a family in ward 8 of Resunga Municipality in Gulmi have been taken ill after eating wild mushrooms on Sunday evening.Members of Tom Bahadur Thapa Shirish’s family fell ill after eating mushrooms collected from Resunga Community Forest, according to the District Police Office, Gulmi.After receiving initial treatment at Gulmi District Hospital, they were taken to Lumbini Medical College in Palpa for further treatment. \nThe United States topped the medals table at the Paris Olympics with 40 golds after the final title was decided on Sunday, finishing above China only by virtue of their 44 silvers.China, who were the last team apart from the US to top the standings when they did it on home soil at the 2008 Beijing Games, also won 40 golds but managed only 27 silvers.The US women’s basketball team secured their country's pre-eminence by edging host nation France in a breathless finish to win the final gold of the Games.

The plane did not report any emergency.Videos of the event show that the sky was apparently clear when the plane started spiraling in an unusual circling motion.What will experts be looking for?US aviation safety expert Anthony Brickhouse said investigators would look at aspects like weather and examine to what extent the engines and controls were functioning properly, to help identify what caused the loss of control.Could weather conditions have caused the crash?Videos of the crash analyzed by aviation experts led some to speculate that ice had built up on the plane. On Friday, Voepass said ice was predicted at the altitudes in which the plane was flying, but that it should have been within an acceptable level.Brazilian aviation engineer and crash investigator Celso Faria de Souza said he is almost certain ice caused the accident, judging from the video.ATR-72 planes have experienced issues with icing, with a crash in 1994 in the US state of Indiana killing 68, after the plane was unable to bank due to ice buildup. After that incident, manufacturer ATR improved its de-icing system. In 2016 in Norway an ATR-72 experienced issues after ice accumulated on the plane, but the pilot was able to regain control.Could the engine have failed?John Hansman, a professor in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reviewed some of the Brazil crash footage shared on social media and without having reviewed flight data said the crash did not appear to have been caused by weather.It may have been an engine failure on one side, mismanaged by the crew, which would lead to the rotation downward, said Hansman.Are multiple points of failure possible?Air crashes could be due to any number of factors, according to experts. Among them could be ice, engine failure or human error. In many instances there is more than one cause, said Robert A. Clifford, a lawyer who represented some of the families of crash victims in the 1994 accident. \n'Resonance of Hues', an ongoing art exhibition at Hotel Vivanta in Kathmandu, showcases the works of eight prominent Nepali artists, exploring Nepali culture through traditional and modern artistic expressions.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather is expected Monday with light to heavy rain likely in various provinces, accompanied by thunder and lightning, while nighttime may bring similar conditions with possible heavy rainfall in certain areas.\nNepali Congress faces pressure for timely general convention, with demands for adherence to party charter and criticism of leadership's performance, particularly in governance.\nIn autumn, drones will begin collecting garbage from Mt.

He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\nThe fifth edition of the Kathmandu Triennale, organised by the Siddhartha Arts Foundation and the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts, will occur in February 2026. It will feature more than one hundred artworks. The Triennale will take place at numerous venues, including the Nepal Art Council, Patan Museum, and Siddhartha Art Gallery. The theme of the Kathmandu Triennale is ‘Coexistence, Kinship, and Care’. The Australian Embassy supported and patronised previous editions of the Kathmandu Triennale. The embassy hosted a reception event to interact with potential patrons this time. One of the Artistic directors, Natalie King, is also an Australian curator.Australian ambassador Felicity Volk says, “As we look around at a world fractured by politics, by war and heightened geopolitical tensions, by climate change and environmental devastation, we are reminded that we also need to look for the ways we are united, the ways we can work in solidarity and harmony towards a better world for all people. And so there is no more important theme than that which Kathmandu Triennale 2026 will explore: Coexistence, kinship, care.” The event aims to promote Nepali arts and culture and establish Kathmandu as an international art hub. Artistic Directors Natalie King and Sujan Chitrakar will choose forty artists. “To a maximum of 10 Nepali artists, we will be providing an international counterpart”, says Chitrakar. To establish a long-lasting academic and cultural exchange within the region, the Triennale also seeks to organise a Students’ Triennale amongst various art institutions and their students. Tribhuvan University, Sirjana College of Fine Arts, and Kathmandu University will engage with institutions from countries such as India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and more. The Triennale began as the pioneering Kathmandu International Art Festival (KIAF), which set critical precedents during its 2009 and 2012 editions. It explored questions about the status of women and climate change. In 2017, the festival converted into the Triennale format, with an exhibition exploring the city as a creative locus. The programme will not be Kathmandu-centric to magnify the influence of the Kathmandu Triennale and foster greater inclusivity. A wide array of exhibitions and workshops will be conducted concurrently as satellite events that span beyond the valley. “It will be a global platform for Nepali artists to connect with international artists and stakeholders. I hope it will help recognise Nepal in the global map”, adds Chitrakar.  \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) claims to be a ‘cadre-less party’ on its official website, under the section ‘How Are We Different?’. The RSP emerged as the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives from the November 2022 general elections, within six months of its registration with the Election Commission.At the time, the party was truly an organisation without a cadre base and it emerged as a prominent political force by selling its anti-corruption agenda.The three largest parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—fight elections mainly based on their cadre strength across the country. Nepal’s communist parties are heavily dependent on their networks of cadres. Though the Congress used to claim to be a mass-based organisation, it has also become a cadre-based party with structures down to the 753 local units and deeper into wards and toles.The RSP mentions on its website eight points to show how it is different from other parties. One of the points presents itself as a party without cadres.Within two years of its formation, however, it is now considering building party committees down to the grassroots. The party plans to expand its organisation not only to local units but also their wards—just like the traditional parties.Soon after being ousted from government last month, the RSP organised a closed camp in Kathmandu on August 2-3, which decided to form party committees at the local level and also to form shadow local governments. It was the April Ilam by-election that changed RSP leaders’ perception and made them realise the importance of party committees at the local level. Despite its high expectations and mobilisation of the party’s full strength at the Ilam constituency, the party lost the election. RSP leaders later concluded that the weak party organisation was to blame.“A new party like ours has a weak organisation compared to more established parties. Due to this, the RSP could not do well in the Ilam-2 byelection,” Manish Jha, who then was the joint spokesperson for the party, had told the Post from Ilam.The party’s closed camp last week provided 15 points of suggestion to the leadership. One concerned forming shadow governments at local units along with the expansion of party committees.The 14th point is about “practising formation of shadow governments at local units in a phase-wise approach”. “The closed camp advised the central committee to form shadow governments at the local level but that is not an official party decision,” acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti told the Post. “But the central committee will probably support this proposal.” Despite the party officially announcing that it would be a cadre-free organisation, Burlakoti claims that the party has been constituting local committees since its formation. Currently, it has formed committees in 1,800 out of 6743 wards and sees the possibility of expanding them to at least 4,000 wards. Burlakoti says despite going down to the local level, the party won’t form large committees. But political observers are not convinced.“Without cadres, no political party can form its committees,” Pitamber Bhandari, a political observer, told the Post. “Formation of local chapters is a shift in the RSP’s stance.” The RSP, which claims to be an alternative political force, is considering following the footsteps of old parties by expanding party committees to the grassroots.Suryaraj Acharya, a former leader of Bibeksheel Sajha party that championed the idea of alternative politics in the country, said the RSP seems confused about the party structure. Acharya, who also contested the second Constituent Assembly election from Kathmandu-2, said the Bibeksheel Sajha also faced a similar confusion then. “Not only in Nepal, alternative political parties in other parts of the world also seem confused about their structures,” Acharya told the Post. “How can they lead alternative politics through a party similarly structured to old forces they so strongly criticised?”Burlakoti does not agree.“The structure itself is irrelevant when we make the committees small and disciplined,” he argues. Bhandari doesn’t buy Burlakoti’s argument.“When their party was in power, they recommended the party central committee member Arnico Kumar Panday as a member of the National Planning Commission. He relinquished party membership but when the party left the government, Panday resigned from the commission and rejoined the party,” Bhandari said. “How is their approach different then?” Bhandari questioned. Acharya doubts the RSP can reshape itself easily. They might also face difficulties in finding cadres at the grassroots level where the old parties have form bases. “Even if they find some people who can push their agenda through social media, it is difficult to find whole timers to run party committees.”Acting general secretary Burlakoti, however, said the RSP’s structure will be different to that of other parties. “Even as the committees of other parties are more inclined to misuse the budget at the local level, our party won’t indulge in such things.” Acharya recalls Bibeksheel Sajha’s mistake. “While we tried to give shape to the party structure, activists and some people without political culture joined us. This ultimately caused a lot of problems,” he said. “The RSP might face a similar problem if they are not careful.” \nFormer prime minister and CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal said on Saturday that he will propose broader unity among the leftist parties.According to party spokesperson Agni Prasad Sapkota, at the ongoing Standing Committee meeting, Dahal proposed a left unity that goes beyond the Socialist Front, an existing alliance of four left and socialist parties in Nepal. The front was announced on June 19 last year. Apart from the Maoist Centre, the CPN (Unified Socialist), the Nepal Socialist Party led by Mahendra Yadav and the Communist Party of Nepal led by Netra Bikram Chand “Biplav” are associated with the front.“Nepali people want greater unity among leftist parties and reorganisation of communist parties,” Sapkota quoted Dahal as saying. “That a similar plan did not work in the past does not mean it won’t work in the future as well.”The UML and the Maoist Centre formed an alliance in 2017 to jointly contest the general elections and won an overwhelming majority in Parliament. They merged to form the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) in June 2018. However, the party was dissolved in March 2021 after the Supreme Court invalidated the unified party’s registration.Dahal also hoped that, in due course, more parties and leaders would join hands for a larger reorganisation of the communist parties.The ruling UML, the largest communist party at the moment, has decided to stay away from such an alliance.Dahal stressed that there was no alternative to unity among the leftist parties, according to a leader who attended the meeting.“We are in talks with Madhav Kumar Nepal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and Netra Bikram Chand of the Communist Party of Nepal, as well as with some other outfits, in order to form a progressive alliance,” Dahal told the party’s standing committee. “Now, the time has come for unity among the left parties while also bringing together patriotic, pro-people and progressive forces.”The Maoist Centre, which is a distant-third biggest party in the House of Representatives with 32 seats, is discussing ways to improve the party’s image by launching a purge in the party and building a more solid organisational base. Several standing committee members urged the top leadership to launch a campaign to strengthen the party organisation, said Sapokta. The Maoist Centre also has decided to push for the directly-elected presidential system to ensure political stability.The Maoist party’s position is that there is no alternative to an executive president, said Sapkota. “We had also written a ‘note of dissent’ insisting on the same while drafting the constitution.”If the Nepali Congress and the UML want political stability, let’s elect an executive president, Sapkota proposed. “Only such a political system can ensure stability.”Sapkota said the leaders called for a purification campaign to strengthen the party and regain its lost glory. “The political situation has become difficult. In order to safeguard national interests, democracy and people’s livelihoods, we have to be stronger,” said Sapkota. “For this, we have to purge bad elements from the party. We have been weakened by the parliamentary system.”Leaders say a “serious soul-searching” is underway in the Maoist Centre, which emerged the single largest party from the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008 but has been consistently downsized in successive elections. Dahal was removed from the prime minister’s position last month, after the Congress and the UML joined forces against him. Now, Dahal, who faces multiple challenges, is working out strategies to revive the party. \nThe government is pushing ahead with a law to double the threshold for the representation of the parties in the House of Representatives and the provincial assemblies.In the draft bill to Amend and Consolidate the Election Law forwarded to the Election Commission for review, the Ministry of Home Affairs has increased the threshold for the House to five percent and to three percent for the provincial assemblies.In July last year, the constitutional election body had forwarded the draft amendments to the ministry, retaining the existing threshold of 3 and 1.5 percentages in the House and the provincial assemblies, respectively. However, the home ministry has revised the provision, making it more difficult for fringe parties to secure their presence in the legislature. “The home ministry has made some changes in the draft bill, including in the threshold [provision]. We are reviewing it,” a senior official at the commission told the Post. Currently, only the parties securing a minimum of 1.5 percent of the total valid votes under the proportional representation (PR) category in the provincial assemblies are given PR seats. The threshold is three percent at the federal level. These provisions were inserted through an amendment to the Election Act in July 2017, amid reservations from fringe parties.The CPN-UML, the Nepali Congress, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and four other parties managed to cross the three percent threshold in the 2022 parliamentary elections. The smaller forces with the national party status are the Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, and Janamat Party. Only five parties got the minimum five percent votes under the proportional system in 2022.The election commission has proposed 27 revisions to the electoral law through the amendment draft, including a provision to enable Nepali citizens living abroad to exercise their franchise. The commission has proposed provisions to allow them to vote under the PR category via Nepal’s diplomatic missions in the respective countries. The government has also made slight changes to the provision. It proposes that voting platforms can be offered after evaluating its feasibility in the host country, said the official. “There are no major changes in other provisions.”As per the commission’s amendment proposal, a candidate having been elected twice should be barred from standing in the proportional representation category again. There are currently no legal limits to how many times candidates can fight elections.The commission has also proposed that a candidate who has lost elections (local, provincial or federal) shall not be allowed to file candidacy from another constituency in either of the categories for five years, except for the by-election in the respective constituency.Moreover, the commission also plans to introduce the right to reject any candidate, with the ‘NOTA’ sign included in the ballot paper. For the first time in Nepal’s election history, the commission has proposed the NOTA [none of the above] option for voters who don’t want to vote for any of the candidates on the ballot. If NOTA votes exceed 50 percent of the total valid votes, the election will be cancelled.In the draft bill to amend election laws, the commission seeks to make it mandatory for the political parties to field at least 33 percent women candidates for the first-past-the-post polls. The commission says the changes have been proposed in the new integrated election law to replace seven different existing laws. The changes are based on Nepal’s constitution, the directives of the Supreme Court and past experiences.Enlisting voters through the electronic medium, collecting details of Nepali citizens living abroad to update the voter roll, and fixing the election day and duration of publicity campaigns are other proposed revisions.To ensure better representation of women, one of the two candidates for chairperson and vice-chair of rural municipalities or mayor and deputy mayor of municipalities must be a woman. The bill proposes that at least 33 percent of ward chair candidates must be women.Another proposal is that all candidates must submit their property details (including assets owned by their family members) while filing their candidacy.To avoid confusion over the start and end of the terms of elected representatives, the bill says it begins on the day of election for all winners of the House of Representatives, Provincial Assembly, and local government positions, while their term ends the day they file candidacy for the next election.Other proposed revisions require candidates to use the bank accounts to fund their campaigns declared while registering their candidacy, and allowing public transport on election day.To urge the government to register the bill in Parliament without delay, a team led by Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Thapaliya on Wednesday met with Minister for Home Affairs Ramesh Lekhak. “The home minister assured us that the bill would be registered in the ongoing session of Parliament. I find the government serious about the issue this time,” Thapaliya told the Post. \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nWomen generally pick green leaves from the sal tree (Shorea robusta) and stitch them into plates and bowls. Until recently, the process was all manual. Now, Phool Kumari Chaudhary, a homemaker in far-western Nepal, has something to cheer about.She collects leaves from the community forest nearby and sorts them out in the village.She then uses moulding machines to produce plates and bowls, which are traditionally used during fairs, festivals, and religious ceremonies in Nepal.“We collect leaves and dry them for a day. After that, we put the leaves on the machine and produce bowls and plates,” said Chaudhary, the Duna Tapari Producers’ Group coordinator in Rajghat, Krishnapur Municipality. Women are making leaf plates in self-help groups and selling them at the local market. This helps them support their families and in their children’s education.The business of making leaf plates has a huge potential. Besides being eco-friendly, the process is cheap and promotes a green economy.In city areas, some fast food vendors, restaurants and hotels have also started serving meals on sal-leaf dishes. Experts say that since Nepal’s hotels have decided to ban single-use plastics from January 1, 2025 as they join the fight against plastic pollution and a campaign to promote sustainable tourism, the demand for environment-friendly plates and bowls could rise.The women's group said that while single-use plastic items cause serious environmental problems, sal leaves are a sustainable option. Chaudhary said women associated with the Bandev Community Forest produced the environmentally-friendly plates and bowls after training.The leaf plates and bowls produced in Laljhadi are dispatched to the markets in Kathmandu and Pokhara. “So far, we have sent two consignments to Kathmandu,” said Chaudhary.The machine provided to the community produces bowls measuring 5 to 7 inches to plates of 10 and 12 inches. Bowls and plates cost Re1 to Rs6 apiece, depending on the size.“Most of the bowls and plates are used in the villages. We cannot fulfil the demand on special occasions,” Chaudhary said. It has become a side job for women, most of them farmers.“As we are busy on the farm or occupied with home’s daily affairs, we produce leaf bowls and plates during our free time,” said Chaudhary.The Bandev Community Forest group in Ward 5 of Krishnapur also started making bowls and plates in April. A total of eight women are engaged in the business.“We have not yet sent our products outside the village,” said Yasodha Rawal, treasurer of the community forest. “If we work daily, we can make good money,” said Rawal. Rawal said that after the community forest coordination committee in the Laljhadi Mohana Conservative Area provided training, they started making leaf bowls and plates.As the demand for bio plates and bowls is increasing, women’s groups plan to open a shop and cater to other districts too.Due to the rainy season, women are no longer able to go to the jungle. The leaves collected previously are being used to make bowls and plates.The machine can produce 500 bowls and plates a day. The women's group also buys the leaves collected by others.Large and green healthy leaves are primarily available during the March-April period.There is a slack season, when demand drops. “During the spring season, as women were busy harvesting wheat, we suffered a loss as the leaves decayed,” said Rawal.Sal leaves that used to rot in the community forest are being processed now to generate income from women, said Niraj Bhandari, president of Bandev Community Forest, Rajghat. This has helped many women become self-dependent. Experts say this could be an alternative for plastic and glass utensils in hotels, restaurants, and hospitals for cost and environmental reasons and without compromising hygiene.Leaf plates are easy to dispose of and can also be fed to cattle. \nThe CG Corp Global and the Enhanced Skills for Sustainable and Rewarding Employment (ENSSURE) project on Friday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the apprenticeship programme regulated by the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT).The agreement was signed by Nirvana Chaudhary, managing director of CG Corp Global, and Rabindra Bahadur Singh, team leader of the ENSSURE project, a bilateral initiative of the government of Nepal and Switzerland, executed at the federal level by CTEVT and at the provincial level by the education-related ministries with technical assistance from Helvetas Nepal.Dr Danielle Meuwly, ambassador of Switzerland to Nepal, Mahesh Bhattarai, member secretary of the CTEVT, and Dr Prabin Manandhar, country director of Helvetas Nepal attended the MOU signing ceremony.CG Corp Global will provide apprentices to 100 youths who are skilled technicians in various occupations such as hotel management, mechanical engineering, automobile engineering, and early childhood development facilitators, etc., said a statement issued after signing of the MoU.“In the apprenticeship programme, youths receive some theoretical knowledge and practical competencies in a technical school but hone their skills at the industry under the supervision of an in-company trainer,” the statement said. “Eventually, they receive a pre-diploma or diploma certificate awarded by CTEVT.”Young people gain industry networks, earn while they learn and obtain a recognised qualification, it said. “This collaboration will bridge the gap between education and employment, providing youths with the necessary skills and opportunities to thrive in their careers,” Managing Director of CG Corp Global Chaudhary said.Stating that Switzerland has a century-old tradition of dual education for apprenticeship, that is education that takes place both in school as well as in companies and industry, Ambassador Meuwly said 70 percent of Swiss youths do this type of dual education at secondary level.“Many managers in successful Swiss companies, such as top Swiss banks, graduated as apprentices,” she said. Member Secretary Bhattarai said that this partnership will significantly contribute to their mission of providing quality vocational education and training that meets the demands of the industry.Manandhar said this partnership will not only enhance vocational training but also ensure that it aligns with industry standards and meets the needs of the market. \nIndia has agreed to build for Nepal a slew of petroleum projects on grants, in what is being billed as a sign of renewed engagement between the two immediate neighbours.Observers, however, see the development differently. It could make Nepal more dependent on fossil fuels. This despite the country having abundant renewable energy in the upcoming years to power the transport sector as well as energy-efficient electric stoves in its kitchens.On the one hand, commitments are made in different high-level global forums to adopt green energy, and on the other, petroleum pipelines are being built. Chandi Prasad Ghimire, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, said that Minister Damodar Bhandari met Hardeep Singh Puri, minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, India, during the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in New Delhi on Wednesday and shared the news about the agreement on the petroleum pipeline projects.“We were unclear about funding modalities. But now it’s clear that all three projects will be built by the Indian government on grant.”The agreed projects are an oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa; a greenfield tank terminal in Charali; and an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan.The estimated cost of these projects is Rs17 billion.Nepal has also proposed a cross-border liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline. “The funding modality of the LPG pipeline is yet to be decided,” said Ghimire. An energy expert working in a government project, who wished not to be named, told the Post that building an LPG pipeline is another blunder. “Nepal will see a considerable amount of electricity generation that could substitute cooking gas and reduce trade deficit,” he said.“Building new pipelines free of cost means Nepal has to sign a long-term fuel import agreement with India to raise the construction cost.”Nepal aims to increase clean energy generation to 15,000 MW by 2030 and plans for it are on track.Experts say it's a double standard.Ram Prasad Dhital, an energy expert, told the Post last December that billions of rupees spent on pipeline projects will go to waste. According to him, there is an immediate need to decarbonise the transport sector, and most countries, including Nepal’s two immediate neighbours, are already moving in that direction.What’s the rationale behind investing in the oil pipelines, experts have questioned.While the Nepal government has committed to net-zero emissions by 2045, it is building the petroleum pipeline.The new petroleum pipelines and storage tanks will increase Nepal’s dependence on fossil fuel, said Bhushan Tuladhar, an environmental expert.“This kind of policy discourages energy transition. If we have the strength of green energy, we should promote it. We should not rely on fossil fuels, which we don’t produce,” Tuladhar added.Nepal imports petroleum products worth Rs337.34 billion, which comes to nearly 20 percent of the country’s total import bills. Tuladhar said Nepal needs to substitute fossil fuels with green energy to reduce the ever-growing trade deficit.He said that instead of investing in fuel pipelines, the government should invest in renewable hydropower, cross-border energy trade and installation of charging stations for EVs.To fulfil the net-zero emission commitment by 2045, the government has also introduced an ambitious hydropower roadmap.In the transport sector, Nepal has launched a strategy to increase the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) to 90 percent of all private passenger vehicles, including two-wheelers, sold and 60 percent of all four-wheeler public passenger vehicle sales by 2030.Massive tax waivers have been given on EV imports to promote electricity and reduce fossil fuel imports.The agreement to build the oil pipeline projects even if it is fast tracked, may take five to six years. And by that time, a rough estimate shows that electricity generation and EV sales would take a quantum leap. In the first 11 months of this fiscal year, EV sales have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Nepal imported fossil fuel-consuming 10,310 units of passenger vehicles worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billion.Tuladhar said Nepal’s private sector is aggressively investing in the hydro sector, and the government’s investment in petroleum infrastructure could be a setback for them as well as the country.The government has also set a goal of installing 500,000 improved cooking stoves, primarily in rural areas, and an additional 200,000 household biogas plants and 500 large-scale biogas plants.Nepal’s strategy is to have electric stoves as the primary mode of cooking in 25 percent of households by 2030.It is estimated that to meet the target, Nepal would need to invest $25 billion.Nepali politicians have been making many promises to switch to clean energy.Last December, then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal attended the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28) in Dubai and spoke on climate finance Nepal seeks from the international community.In his speech at the summit, Dahal said, “Nepal is fully committed to the Paris Agreement. We are committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, five years earlier than the global target. We will fully utilise our hydropower potential to secure clean energy and maintain 45 percent forest-covered land.”Before attending COP28 in May, Dahal and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to build two cross-border pipelines and one petroleum tank with grants from the Indian Oil Corporation during Dahal's visit to New Delhi, India. In New Delhi, two ministers discussed building the Motihari-Sarlahi LPG pipeline, said Ghimire. “The agreement for this project will soon be finalised. We have requested the Indian government to build the LPG pipeline on grant.” Ghimire said that these projects will contribute to reducing the transportation cost.The construction work may start within 2-3 months.“Our commitment to reducing carbon emissions on international forums and building petroleum pipeline projects don’t match. But we don’t have any alternative to meet the energy demand right now.” he said. “So, we need a few petroleum projects.”Experts, however, question what the country will do with the hydro energy the government and the private sector are producing with billions of dollars of investment. The pipe-line project may take 5-6 years to complete and there seems to be no plan to substitute petroleum imports. “The government's policy is to increase the use of electricity, but supply is unreliable,” Ghimire said. Experts, however, questioned whether the electricity supply will remain unreliable even after five years. “Something is cooking here,” they say. \nIs Nepal set to launch its first judicial inquiry into recent air crashes?Despite 71 years of aviation history punctuated by 109 air accidents, Nepal has thus far never initiated a judicial or criminal inquiry.On Thursday, in a landmark move, the parliamentary International Relations and Tourism Committee ordered the government to form an independent inquiry commission to look into the country’s overall air safety standards and recommend action if someone is found guilty, particularly in connection with recent plane crashes.The parliamentary committee has given the experts commission 15 days to submit a report.“The two air accidents in two weeks have dented the country's image. We need to find a way to prevent future accidents and bring officials responsible for such utter negligence to justice,” said Raj Kishore Yadav, the committee chairman.Many lawmakers have echoed these concerns, calling for the prosecution of responsible officials. They have criticised the civil aviation regulator for its apparent negligence. The order means Nepal has formally initiated judicial proceedings through a separate investigation commission, which can hold the airline companies, the regulator, aircraft manufacturers, pilots, engineers, and others accountable for gross negligence and misconduct that have resulted in loss of life.“That’s a landmark order. But there are no specific laws in Nepal under which the guilty can be prosecuted,” said Rajan Pokhrel, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. “The Civil Aviation Act talks about judicial proceedings, but there is no law to enforce them.”For example, if a government-formed independent investigation commission recommends cancelling an airline company’s licence for gross negligence, there will be a confusion about who will enforce the recommendation. In Nepal, the results of accident investigations are not admissible in court and do not result in fines or other consequences.However, in many countries, investigations are typically conducted in two different ways. For example, in France, a pair of investigations are simultaneously conducted: the judicial investigation is directed by a prosecutor or undertaken under his control, and the safety investigation is conducted by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA).These two investigations have different objectives. The judicial inquiry aims to determine fault that may result in liability being established and, thus, convictions.The BEA investigation aims to improve aviation safety for passengers and crews. Unlike judicial investigations, the safety investigation does not presuppose the existence of a misdemeanour or a crime.The BEA investigation follows international rules from the ICAO. The judicial inquiry is based on national law and is undertaken under wildly varying conditions from one country to another. Thus, in some countries, the judicial investigation only starts after the safety investigation.Although in France these investigations are independent of each other, the law has determined their relationship. Thus, for example, flight recorders are placed under seal by the judicial authorities and handed to the BEA to be read out under its control. Further, regular contacts are established between the BEA and the authorities in charge of judicial investigations.The United States also conducts investigations in two different ways.In Nepal, under Article 26 of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, 1944, the government is obliged to institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the accident by the procedure recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Under Nepal’s Civil Aviation (Accident Investigation) Regulations, 2014, which follows Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the sole objective of investigating an accident or serious incident is to prevent accidents and incidents in the future. Therefore, Annex 13 investigations do not consider apportioning blame or liability.Any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability will be separate, as per Nepal’s Accident Investigation Regulations. “The regulations and Act both talk about judicial or administrative proceedings, but there are no particular laws to enforce the results,” says Pokhrel.However, lawyers say it doesn’t stop them from filing criminal charges and unlimited liabilities.Amrit Kharel, an advocate who has filed criminal charges against the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal and Yeti Airlines accusing them of gross negligence that killed 72 people in Pokhara in January 2023, said, “In our territory, it’s our sovereignty to file a case against any misconduct.”The investigation commission under the ICAO Annex 13 is just a fact-finding committee. “But if any person dies due to negligence, they should not be granted any amnesty,” Kharel says. Kharel has been fighting the case on behalf of the families of the US-Bangla Airlines Flight 211 that crashed in Kathmandu in March 2018, killing 51 of the 71 people aboard. Victims have demanded a total compensation worth Rs2.10 billion after the Bangladesh airlines and its insurers and reinsurers failed to provide appropriate compensation.“The case of Yeti Airlines is also gross negligence by the company and the regulator. A criminal investigation is necessary as negligence is growing in Nepal and innocent people are dying as a result,” Kharel adds. He said that if the court finds a person or company guilty of a crime, it’s the state’s responsibility to prosecute them. “No separate aviation law is needed to prosecute the guilty.”On January 15 last year, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed while approaching the new Pokhara airport. The Post also reported that flight calibration, which tests all equipment at the new airport, had yet to recommend landing from the west, the path followed by the Yeti flight.Experts at the time pointed out that the flight procedure was not published, and the airline had very little information on airport procedures and data.No evaluation as required by the ‘safety management system’ carried out, either by the civil aviation regulator, as an airport service provider, or by the airline.“The civil aviation body misused its regulator role to run the airport, neglecting safety requirements. It was a serious crime and mass murder, and subject to criminal investigation,” one aviation expert had said at the time.Speaking in the House on Thursday, Lawmaker Prabhu Sah said frequent crashes have sent the message that Nepal’s air safety is poor. “Relevant agencies should be held responsible and accountable for this. We cannot tolerate this any more. Officials take bribes and people die. The government that only takes the onus for positive things should also take responsibility for the growing corruption.” Though lawmakers who make laws have ordered a separate independent investigation commission to probe the frequent crashes, even if the commision produces the report, experts say, it’s unclear who will implement it.“Legal proceedings are indeed one of the effective measures to overhaul Nepal’s civil aviation,” said Sanjiv Gautam, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. “There are few instances in which courts have prosecuted even the dead pilots for gross negligence.”In a recent example, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a US criminal fraud charge stemming from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners, angering the families of the hundreds of passengers killed who had wanted the case to go to trial.In October 2018, 189 people were killed when Lion Air Flight 610 fell into the Java Sea off Indonesia. In March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa airport, claiming 157 lives.Nepal’s civil aviation service started in 1953 with three old American-made DC-3 Dakotas belonging to an Indian company. After five years, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation was established.Nepal’s aviation sector has grown faster than expected, with passenger traffic climbing from one million to 10 million in just over two decades. \nNearly 60 percent of drinking water samples collected from various places of Lalitpur district—Lalitpur Metropolitan City, Godawari and Mahalaxmi municipalities—are found to be contaminated with faecal coliform.Officials at the Health Office, Lalitpur said that drinking water samples were collected from the local units following an outbreak of cholera in recent weeks.“Out of 12 samples of drinking water collected for quality checks, faecal coliform was found in seven,” said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Lalitpur health office. “We have started chlorinating drinking water at the sources and have taken other measures to prevent further spread of waterborne diseases, including cholera.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or in their faeces. The presence of faecal coliform indicates that the drinking water being used by the residents of Thaiba in Godawari Municipality in Lalitpur is contaminated with sewage, according to doctors.Of the 30 cholera cases reported from across the country, 19 were from various areas of Lalitpur and the remaining from Kailali (8), Kathmandu (1) and Pyuthan (2).Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and or even death within a few hours if untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Faecal coliform had also been detected in the study carried out on water samples collected from Godawari Municipality before the onset of monsoon.As the monsoon is an epidemic season, when most drinking water sources become contaminated due to flooding, presence of deadly microbes—E coli and faecal coliform—in drinking water is not unusual, health officials say. Even jar water, which is generally considered safer compared to water from other sources, often gets contaminated during the monsoon season.What concerns officials most is the apathy of the responsible agencies in launching awareness drives about the risks and other preventive measures. Most local authorities across the country halted testing of drinking water just before the start of monsoon citing budget constraints.Officials at the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL) said that it is the responsibility of consumers themselves to ensure that water is safe before drinking, as the utility cannot guarantee the safety of drinking from every tap.“We request consumers to boil water properly before drinking, as water gets contaminated during the monsoon season due to leakage in pipes and mixing of drainage and rainwater,” said Sailaja Acharya, assistant manager of the KUKL. “We have increased the level of chlorine at the treatment plant and in reservoirs, but water could get contaminated when it reaches household taps.”The KUKL has started supplying water from the Bagmati river to household taps after supply from the Melamchi River was halted. Officials said that water from the Bagmati River gets chlorinated before being supplied to household taps. Doctors say consumption of contaminated water not only can cause diarrhoeal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the risk of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.They stress that awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to protect people from water-borne diseases. A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment is required to contain the spread of infection, according to doctors. \nThe Health Department under the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) is working to issue a tender to buy medicines in bulk for its planned fair-price pharmacies, which will be set up in various locations.KMC officials hope that pharmaceutical companies will offer hefty discounts on bulk purchases, allowing these pharmacies to sell medicines to patients at reduced prices.“It will take a few more months to start the fair-price pharmacies as we are finalising the tender process for buying medicines,” said Sajina Maharjan, an official at the department. “Patients will get medicines at lower prices at our pharmacies, as we will keep only a 20 percent margin on the cost of the medicines.”The KMC plans to set up altogether five fair-price pharmacies across the city. Officials said these pharmacies are part of the KMC’s efforts to provide relief to the metropolis residents. Officials said that the pharmacy will operate independently, but will charge lower prices to patients from the discounts provided by drug companies. According to them, these pharmacies will sell medicines at rates below the maximum retail price.Pharmacies of some state-run hospitals, like the Manmohan Cardiothoracic Vascular and Transplant Centre and the Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, have been running fair-price pharmacies for years.Those pharmacies sell medicines for up to five times less than the maximum retail price.Even after selling medicines for heavily subsidised prices, those hospitals are not incurring losses. In fact, even at these discounted rates, the hospitals’ doctors admit the pharmacies still make a profit of around 20 percent.This is mainly because pharmaceutical companies, like most other companies, set their own MRPs, leading to exorbitant markups. They supply medicines to hospitals and pharmacies at a fraction of the listed price, while most hospitals and pharmacies sell drugs at the inflated MRP.This kind of fraudulent practice is just one example of the deep-seated collusion among drug manufacturing companies, hospitals and pharmacies, and even doctors. Whether it has to do with pricing or prescribing medicines, officials at the Department of Drug Administration said the patients are the only ones at a disadvantage.According to officials, when a drug manufacturer comes up with a new drug, they are legally required to register the product with the Department of Drug Administration. The manufacturer proposes its own MRP, which the department then endorses. Since there are no rules in the Drug Act regarding the pricing of medicines, companies base their prices on those of similar medicines produced by other national and international companies. They can either inflate the prices or keep them lower. But most companies sell their medicines through promotional activities—either by offering incentives to doctors or by providing big margins to wholesalers and retailers. \nIn a bid to address growing mental health problems in children and adolescents, the Ministry of Health and Population has decided to train health workers to examine their mental health conditions.Officials said that as many as 150 health workers, including medical officers, nurses and paramedics, will be trained to screen the mental health conditions of this age group within the current fiscal year.“We hope that the health worker training programme will help lessen existing mental health problems in children and adolescents,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Those serving in primary health care centres will be trained first so that children and adolescents from villages will get access to the services easily.”A report of the National Mental Health Survey Nepal-2020 shows that the prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents was 5.2 percent that year, and the neurotic and stress-related disorders were the most prevalent at 2.8 percent.Likewise, the prevalence of current suicidal thoughts among adolescents was around four percent, while suicidal attempt in the same age group was 0.7 percent. The same report also shows that 0.6 percent of children and adolescents were found to have been suffering from depression.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, lifetime suicidal attempts and future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.Experts say that mental health problems in children and adolescents could be several times more than what the survey portrays. They say that around 10 to 15 percent of the total children and adolescent population could have been suffering from various types of mental health issues, and due to methodological problems, the survey could not portray actual problems.“Children and adolescents could suffer from various types of mental health problems, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, conduct disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder,” said Dr Arun Kunwar, child and adolescent psychiatrist. “But very few parents and teachers realise the problems and seek medical attention. Children get scolded and beaten both at schools and at home.”A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis have mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Health officials said that there are only around half a dozen child and adolescent psychiatric doctors in the country, and only a few are serving in state-run health facilities. Similarly, the major contributors to the treatment gap are societal beliefs, traditions and stigma associated with mental disorders, according to experts.“This training will help health workers notice problems and refer patients to health facilities with child psychiatrists and psychologists,” said Thapa.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nA bi-weekly situation update published by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division on Monday shows one death from the dengue disease and over 300 positive cases. Since the start of this year, the number of people infected with the virus has reached 2,365.Public health experts warn that the death toll and case numbers could go up further in the coming days. They criticise the authorities for their narrow approach—focussing solely on counting cases and deaths, which does little to control the outbreak of the deadly disease.“The authorities have neither conducted risk mapping nor taken measures to lessen the spread of the deadly virus,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Counting cases and deaths is not enough. Even the reported figures are far from reflecting the actual scale of the outbreak.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.“Dengue virus is not like the coronavirus, which spread all over the world suddenly,” said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, an infectious disease expert who is also the administrative head of Dhulikhel Hospital. “We can use the existing data for risk mapping, step up surveillance, and predict disease outbreaks accordingly.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. They say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Even symptomatic patients do not seek treatment at the hospital unless their symptoms get severe. What concerns them much is that many patients take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs—Flexon tablets, Nims, and Rynex, among others—to cure body aches caused by the dengue infection. Using such drugs is very risky during dengue infection.Doctors warn that using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat dengue can increase the risk of internal bleeding, including in the eyes, elevate enzyme levels and damage the liver.Some patients who use NSAIDs in excess also suffer internal bleeding. Such patients need to transfuse platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate, according to them.Health agencies concerned have been shifting responsibilities to other agencies that are ill-equipped and lacking in both financial and human resources.“Every day, 16 to 17 people in our district get infected with the dengue virus,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. Health agencies at the local level have been asked to launch a dengue search and destroy campaign and ramp up awareness about the risks.”Experts say most local units lack the budget and human resources to launch preventive measures. They say that a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nMartyrs Memorial A-Division League champions Church Boys United are ready to face Bhutan’s Paro FC in the qualification playoff of the AFC Challenge League, head coach Bal Gopal Maharjan said on Friday.Church Boys will host Paro at the Dasharath Stadium on August 13. The winners will secure one of the two berths in the group stage of the new third-tier Continental men’s competition.Abdysh-Ata of the Krygyz Republic and Afghanistan’s Attack FC are battling in the other preliminary stage ties for the other remaining spot.The group stage of the Challenge League consists of 18 teams—16 of them qualified directly for the group stage based on their AFC Member Association Rankings.Church Boys are ranked 20 in the Member Association rankings, while Paro are in the 22nd position. The higher ranked team in the tie host the match.Church Boys enjoyed a meteoric rise last season when they won the A-Division League title in their debut season in 2023, also becoming the only second team to win C, B and A division leagues in consecutive seasons after Manang Marshyangdi Club in 1986.Paro’s tale in the Bhutan Premier League is equally inspiring. They were the runners-up in Bhutan’s top tier league in their debut season in 2018 and capped off their impressive arrival with their first league title the next season in 2019. After finishing third in the 2020 season, they won the league for three successive seasons in 2021, 2022 and 2023/24.Maharjan said his men have no problem in facing the Bhutanese. “We have been training for almost a month now. Although our preparations have been short, our team has players who have regularly played for the national team,” said the former national coach Maharjan, who led Nepal to Bangabandhu Cup title in 2016 in Bangladesh and Three Nations Cup trophy in 2021 in Kathmandu. Maharjan also led Nepal’s U-23 team to South Asian Games gold in 2019.“I believe the team will play good football,” Maharjan added.But Paro will be determined to pull off their first ever victory in the continental competition. They were eliminated in the preliminary rounds of the AFC Cup three times (in 2020, 2022, 2023/24).They had lost to Machhindra Club in the Preliminary Round 1 of the AFC Cup at the Dasharath Stadium last year.Church Boys have already announced their 23-member squad for the Paro clash.The draw for the group stage will take place on August 22.Church Boys SquadGoalkeepers: Deep Karki, Tikendra Thapa, Rembo ChaudharyDefenders: Chhiring Lama, Ekraj Budhathoki, Omolaja Kareem, Saubhagya Rai, Ananta Tamang, Yogesh Gurung, Sanish ShresthaMidfielders: Arik Bista, Peter Banda, Santosh Khatri, Bibek Paudel, Rohan Karki, Laken Limbu, Manish JhargaForwards: Anjan Bista, Moses Gyabaah Twum, Niraj Chaudhary, Ayush Ghalan, Sanjeeb Bista, Aditya Shakya \nIn what is being called in Indian media to be her first statement since resigning and fleeing the country on August 5, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina has accused foreign powers like the US of playing a hand in her ouster.Indian news outlet The Print in an article today said it had seen the message conveyed to Hasina's Awami League supporters. India's Economic Times also carried an article about the message, which The Daily Star has not been able to independently verify.“I could have remained in power if I had left St Martin and the Bay of Bengal to America,” she said in the message.According to The Print, the Hasina government saw strained relations with the US for many years. Ahead of January's elections this year, she said “a white man” had offered her a smooth return to power in exchange for an airbase.Hasina also warned the new interim government not to be “used” by such foreign powers.Led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, the new interim government was sworn in on Thursday night, three days after Hasina's ouster.“I resigned so that I did not have to see the procession of dead bodies. They wanted to come to power over your [students'] bodies, I did not allow it. I came with power,” read Hasina's statement.“Maybe if I was in the country today, more lives would have been lost, more wealth would have been destroyed,” she added.She is also expected to address the media while in India next week, The Print article said.Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled Bangladesh on August 5, when a student-led protest culminated in a mass uprising against her Awami League government.More than 400 people were killed in the preceding three weeks, a majority of them in police firing and firing by Awami League activists.The US is Bangladesh's largest foreign direct investor.In her message to supporters and party cadres, she vowed to return to the country, though accepting her defeat.“I will return soon inshAllah. The defeat is mine but the victory is [that of] the people of Bangladesh,” she stated.“I removed myself, I came with your victory, you were my strength, you did not want me, I myself then left, resigned. My workers who are there, no one will lose morale. Awami League has stood up again and again,” she added, according to The Print.The former prime minister also accused people of distorting her words.“I want to repeat to my young students, I never called you Razakars … My words have been distorted. A group has taken advantage of your danger,” she said in the message.The term “Razakar” is considered to be derogatory in Bangladesh as it refers to 'volunteers' who collaborated with the Pakistan Army during Bangladesh's 1971 war for independence. \nA landslide at a landfill in Uganda’s capital Kampala has killed eight people, the city's authorities said on Saturday.The incident happened late Friday after heavy rainfall when sections of the landfill collapsed, covering some nearby houses, Ugandan media reported.Kampala Capital City Authority said government and Red Cross personnel were searching the site and had rescued 14 people.“On a very sad note, eight people have so far been found dead, six adults and two children. The rescue operation is still ongoing ...,” the authority said on its X account.The landfill, known as Kiteezi, has served as Kampala’s sole garbage dump for decades and has turned into a big hill. Residents have long complained of hazardous waste from the site polluting the environment and posing a danger to people.Footage from NTV Uganda television showed people walking on a section of the landfill that had crushed parts of a house, while pictures from UBC Uganda showed an excavator attempting to dig up garbage.Parts of Uganda have been experiencing heavy rains in recent weeks causing flooding and landslides, though no fatalities had previously been reported. \nJuddha Shumsher's zoo in 1932 featured an array of animals including elephants, horses, deer, monkeys, tigers, rhinos, clouded leopards, red pandas, bears, Himalayan gorals, pheasants, Himalayan monals, gharial crocodiles, porcupines, and a lion, among others.\nBangladesh-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin reveled that almost all of her books translated into Nepali are unauthorized, leading to the prevalence of pirated translations and prints of international literature in Nepal's book market, raising concerns about poor quality and moral and legal violations.\nIn 1998, the tragic and sensationalised suicide of Kani Sherpa, a Nepali domestic worker in Kuwait, ignited outrage and cast a shadow over domestic work migration from Nepal. In response, the Government of Nepal enacted various forms of bans on migration to protect its citizens abroad, culminating in an umbrella ban on domestic work migration in 2017. Yet, the demand for Nepali domestic workers remains high, as evidenced by the visas issued by employers abroad. As a result, many poor Nepali citizens, predominantly lower caste women, continue to seek work abroad without proper labour permits, facing increased vulnerability to exploitation. The government refuses to acknowledge that domestic workers could achieve better migration outcomes and ignores the actors benefiting from these restrictions. Unlicensed agents, licensed recruitment agencies, employers, politicians, government agencies, civil society organisations, insurance agencies, travel agents and research consultancies recognise that lifting the ban would empower Nepal’s poorest women but disrupt their businesses. The fact that this ban has endured for eight years—solidified by the government's imposition of seven pre-conditions in 2020 with no clear timeline—reveals a disturbing truth: These actors prioritise their interests over the well-being of Nepal’s most vulnerable.In this article, drawing on research conducted in Sindhupalchowk and Jhapa, we invert the dominant narrative by exploring: If migrant domestic workers aren’t benefiting from Nepal's migration ban on domestic work migration, who is reaping the benefits at the expense of thousands of Nepali domestic workers? The recruitment industryThe actual beneficiaries of the migration ban are recruitment industry actors, primarily unlicensed agents (or brokers), licensed recruitment agencies and employers. With estimates of 50,000 to 100,000 active agents in Nepal, this business thrives as Nepalis seek domestic work abroad. Nepalis rely on trusted individuals—relatives, teachers, former ward presidents, politically connected persons—as their \"agents\". Women seeking domestic work either contact these agents or are targeted through house-to-house recruitment drives, with agents focusing on households facing vulnerabilities like debt, illness, or domestic violence. These agents receive a portion of the recruitment fees paid by employers. For example, a Kuwaiti employer might pay over 1,200 Kuwaiti Dinars (about Rs525,000) to Kuwait agencies to recruit a Nepali domestic worker, with more than 50 percent returning to Nepal and sharing among various actors. Agents sometimes offer women’s families lump sums (from Rs10,000 to Rs70,000) for selecting them. In other cases, women pay to migrate via tourist visas from Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu.This illicit migration increases vulnerability to strandedness in transit spaces and weakens Nepali domestic workers' bargaining power in the international labour market. The perception of 'illegal' slapped on Nepali domestic workers by their own government and embassies invites abuse and exploitation by agents and employers, even though most legally enter foreign countries. While some employers and agents act fairly, the migration ban grants others the impunity to control, discipline, and even punish Nepali domestic workers as they see fit. Many of these agents work for 971 registered recruitment agencies in Nepal. According to one ‘ethical agency’ representative, recruitment agencies must deposit a hefty ‘guarantee money’ into state coffers, which the government sometimes use to compensate the exploited labour. As a result, they fear that lifting the ban on domestic work will thrust the burden of ensuring labour rights onto them—a burden they feel ill-equipped to handle. They dread that allowing migration for domestic work could drive many licensed recruitment agencies to bankruptcy or, at worst, result in blacklisting.Civil society organisations Civil society organisations amplify the fear of domestic worker exploitation by spotlighting selective cases of exploitation and abuse. This outcry, often sensationalised with terms like ‘modern slaves’ imposed by Western funders, is fuelled under the guise of anti-trafficking and domestic work advocacy. This allows them to showcase (if not sell) women's suffering and leverage selective cases to further their agendas.A pressing question raised by research participants is: Why do these organisations, which run anti-migration campaigns and block mobility at the Indo-Nepal borders often fail to provide essential alternative employment opportunities? We found significant distrust in these organisations, which receive substantial funding from sources with political agendas—ranging from anti-immigration to anti-sex work, and religious perpetuation—while discouraging or denying women's mobility and rights.At least two types of organisations benefit from the ban. First, anti-trafficking NGOs, which employ fear-based awareness campaigns, discipline rescued women in their rehabilitation centres, detain and deport (intercept) aspiring women from Indo-Nepal borders to the very communities and families they try to escape. Whilst many women resist these anti-trafficking measures, some efforts often decay, threatening to tear apart the fabric of their communities. The second group comprises organisations that advocate for domestic workers, often referring to vulnerable Nepali returnees as their ‘clients’. Some of these organisations’ staff go to the airport at night to ‘rescue’ poor-looking returnee women. They take these women to their shelter homes, subject them to questioning and profiling, and send them back to their communities. Many women interviewed express fear of people they meet at the airport, noting that avoiding them is crucial to protect themselves and their agents from potential trouble. While many returnee migrant domestic workers need support, it should come from the government, with proper ethical considerations that do not exploit their vulnerability by treating them as 'clients'. The fierce competition for funding leads to a lack of cooperation and coordination, producing repetitive 'rescue' and ‘interception’ data shown only to donors. This data, fixated on negative migration outcomes, overlooks the countless domestic workers who have had positive migration experiences.From restrictions to rightsThe Government of Nepal often bases its restrictive policies on sensationalised news, diplomatic consultations, and skewed data that depict domestic work negatively. This approach allows the government to absolve itself of responsibility for its most vulnerable citizens, disregarding their rights while punishing them.Many returnee domestic workers report that seeking help from the Nepali embassy for labour exploitation is almost impossible, forcing them to arrange their own rescue. Some pay local agents (sometimes their elected representatives), while others pay recruitment agencies abroad, which can lead to raids and prolonged jail terms. When domestic workers die, their body repatriation often relies on the Nepali diaspora or NGO funding in Nepal. If these women return alive, they do not find any sustainable reintegration infrastructure developed by the government that specifically addresses their needs.Hence, the migration ban shifts the burden away from the government of Nepal, allowing it to abandon the rights of its poorest female citizens. Whilst other countries are willing to negotiate the rights of Nepali domestic workers, the government’s lack of political will betrays Nepal’s most vulnerable, prioritising the interests of benefiting actors over the rights of its people. Hence, it is time to immediately lift the migration ban on domestic work, strictly regulate the actors benefiting from these restrictive policies, and urgently begin negotiations with receiving countries to ensure the rights of hundreds of thousands of Nepali citizens. \nOli and Deuba formed a secret midnight deal to oust Prachanda as Prime Minister, driven by Oli's ambition, Deuba's strategy, and a lack of democratic control in the major political parties.\nNepal's women's volleyball team defeated India, reached the finals, despite societal barriers, highlighting their success in sports, particularly in football and volleyball, despite gender disparities in pay and infrastructure.\nThe taskforce of the three major political parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre—formed to find meeting points on the contentious provisions of the bill to amend the transitional justice-related law has submitted its report to the chiefs of three parties. The points of the agreement forged by the three-member panel were informally made public last week. Again, most notably, on Wednesday the chiefs of all three parties jointly accepted the report and unequivocally committed to resolving the remaining task of the peace process. After getting the report, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli vowed to expedite the bill and endorse it from Parliament without any further ado and then to swiftly implement it. In the prime minister’s words, this time, the amendment to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act would be meaningful and the ‘remnants of the conflict’ will be dealt with once and for all. Chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who led the decade-long Maoist insurgency, and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, sounded as committed to finding closure. Much optimism based just on Nepali leaders’ words may not be warranted. But, at times, important political achievements have been possible when leaders of these three parties have joined hands. Signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, management of arms and army of the Maoist party, constitution promulgation in 2015, among other knotty issues related to the peace process, took place based on such understanding among these forces. A major but crucial task that remains pending is delivery of justice to the victims, as envisioned in the CPA all those years ago. Of the three parties, Dahal of the Maoist Centre and Nepali Congress’ Deuba often felt put under pressure to swiftly conclude the peace process, as these parties were directly engaged in the insurgency from opposite sides—much more than the UML. In the past when Deuba and Dahal tried to push the process, UML leaders appeared intent on hindering its progress, sometimes out of conviction and sometimes for purely political reasons. With Prime Minister Oli keen to conclude the process at a time of his government leadership, and Deuba and Dahal ready to capitalise on the rare opportunity, there could perhaps be no better time to take the peace process to its conclusion. That said, the agreement among the leaders of the three parties is not sufficient. They must not forget that all they are doing is ultimately aimed at the victims. If the victims feel they are not getting justice, completing the process would be meaningless. Many have found the provisions proposed by the three-member panel largely progressive and fair, but a section of victims are still dissatisfied with a few conditions. We urge the major politicians to strive to address the concerns of these holdout victims while giving final touches to the amendment bill. Trying to ram the bill through Parliament without such effort would be ill-advised. Addressing the concerns raised by the Supreme Court in its past decisions and winning the trust of the international community is as important. On the other hand, those advocating on the victims’ behalf would also do well not to seek a perfect solution to what is an inherently complex problem.  \nCPN-UML Chair and current Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is instinctively combative against anyone he sees as even remotely challenging his authority. Using his unmatched flair for Nepali idioms, he is a past master at verbally taking down the credibility of his political opponents. The good news for him is that after the exit from the UML of senior leaders like Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal in early 2021, Oli has near complete control over the party machinery. Yet the insecurity over the possible emergence of rival leaders apparently continues to gnaw at the septuagenarian leader. The much-discussed reentry of ex-Nepali President Bidya Devi Bhandari into the UML fold may have given Oli many sleepless nights. Bhandari is not his only headache. Speaking at a party meeting on Sunday, Oli warned the UML rank and file that no kind of factionalism would be tolerated in the party. He added, for good measure, that even though such diktats had been issued in the past, this time he was dead serious. But then the chairperson is himself being accused of promoting factionalism. For instance, Bishnu Paudel, a trusted lieutenant of Oli, was made the finance minister on top of his responsibility of monitoring the party’s organisational activities. But Prithivi Subba Gurung, the new minister of information and communication, who has often had testy ties with Oli, is now without any responsibility in the party. (Earlier, he used to lead the UML’s parliamentary affairs department.) The ‘burden’ of dual responsibilities is apparently fine for a leader close to the party chair, someone more distant cannot be similarly overburdened. While Oli spoke on Sunday, he was also hinting at the undesirability of other possible factions in his party. There seems to be great tussle between Pokharel and Paudel, two Oli stalwarts, for influence. Most recently, this was seen during the appointment of the chief minister of Lumbini Province, with Chet Nath Acharya (who is close to Pokharel) and Leela Giri (close to Paudel) duelling it out for the top job, with Acharya eventually coming out on top. This tussle seems to have displeased Oli, perhaps because it suggests even his close acolytes might not be under his total control.A degree of competition is not just desirable but healthy for political parties. Yet Oli is having none of it. He warned his party that the promotion of factional politics in the name of internal democracy is unacceptable. Factionalism and internal democracy are both anathema to Oli. Even while he may boast that he will run the party for another two decades, it is only natural for those in and outside the UML to think of his eventual successor as party chair. Only with the right kind of debate will the right candidate emerge. Trying to maintain complete control is one sure way to break the party, as Oli found out in 2021. It might have worked to his advantage back then, yet if something like that happens again, Oli’s political stature is sure to be diminished. Oli as the party’s custodian should be promoting healthy debates and discussions instead of trying to stifle dissent. As the undisputed leader of the UML, he has everything to gain by adopting this more democratic approach to governance.    \nThe ripples of Nepal’s political instability are far-reaching, extending beyond its border. Soon after a government falls and a new prime minister assumes office, provincial leaders are toppled, senior bureaucrats are transferred, and ministers are changed—and so are the ambassadors. Little do our leaders seem to care how detrimental the coming and going of envoys is for the country’s image. The new coalition government headed by KP Oli has recently finalised the names of 19 envoys to serve in different capitals. The ambassadors appointed by the previous coalition under Pushpa Kamal Dahal were recalled. Only time will tell the fate of the new appointees, as we cannot say how long the incumbent government will last. Recalling envoys en masse every time there is a government change is not conducive for a country like Nepal that is having to maintain an increasingly difficult balance between major powers like India, China and the US. Ambassadors, when appointed to a new place, need some time to familiarise themselves with their new environment. But if they are replaced no sooner than they are appointed, the very purpose of diplomacy is lost. Half of Nepal’s ambassadors are political appointees and the rest are career diplomats. The political appointments in particular are problematic. Krishna Prasad Oli, a close associate of the prime minister, has been picked as the ambassador to China. (His main coalition partner, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Nepali Congress chief, also undoubtedly got to have his say in other picks.) Oli’s envoys are predominantly so-called upper-caste men, with only four women and not a single Dalit ambassador nominee. There also seems to be little forethought on when and when not to recall ambassadors. Take the case of Shankar Sharma, Nepal’s former ambassador to India. Appointed by Deuba in March 2022 when he was in a coalition with Dahal, Sharma was recalled when Dahal allied with Oli to form a new government back in March this year. He has been reappointed after coming to power of the UML-Congress coalition. This kind of immature diplomacy with a country as important as India will do great harm to Nepal’s interests. Experts have suggested increasing the proportion of career diplomats as ambassadors from the current 50 percent to 80 or 90 percent. That will apparently decrease political meddling in the process. Perhaps an even better idea is to pick ambassadors, at least to important capitals like New Delhi, Beijing and Washington DC, on the basis of broad political understanding. After all, even if there is a change in government, a combination of the same two or three parties will come to power. If that is the case, why not make these picks judiciously through political consultations and let the ambassadors work for their full four-year term? That would also be in keeping with our national interest. One thing that can be done to ensure that the right people are picked is to make the nominees undergo a rigorous parliamentary vetting process. Up until now, such hearings for ambassador picks have been no more than rituals. But as we recently saw in the case of Krishna Man Pradhan, someone charged with sexual exploitation who was nominated as election commissioner, the parliamentary hearing process can be quite effective in keeping out the bad eggs. Again, in these testing times around the world for international relations and diplomacy, Nepal cannot afford to continue with its current ad hoc approach. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nMonsoon-induced disasters in Nepal have killed many despite advancements in forecasting technology due to insufficient stations, lack of expertise, and the rapid pace of climate change, necessitating organizational restructuring and updated policies to protect lives.\nNepali Congress and CPN-UML formed a government, ousting Pushpa Kamal Dahal as PM, raising concerns about the weakening of progressive agendas.
