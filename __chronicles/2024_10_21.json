Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nTwo months after the amendment of the transitional justice law, the committee tasked with nominating candidates for two truth and reconciliation commissions commences its work, aiming to select ten office bearers within two months.\nRabi Lamichhane, head of RSP, was detained for six days over embezzlement charges against Suryadarshan Cooperative, sparking protests both for and against his detention, and a prohibited order was issued in Pokhara due to unrest.\nA pregnant woman hospitalized with dengue showcases a concerning surge in infections among this vulnerable population, raising maternal and newborn health risks and potentially hampering progress towards reducing Nepal's maternal mortality rate.\nFormer home minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha discusses the performance of Nepal's government, highlighting concerns over corruption, disaster relief shortcomings, and the arrest of Rabi Lamichhane, while also emphasizing the need for a united opposition to challenge the government's alleged wrongdoings, including the possible amendment of the Political Parties Act.\nFloods damaged tomato farms in Nepal, leading to a fourfold increase in prices due to short supply, with further price hikes expected due to upcoming festivals and delayed arrival of new production.\nRabi Lamichhane, former deputy PM and RSP chief, was arrested for misappropriating cooperative funds; investigations into similar allegations against Congress and UML leaders are demanded for credibility.\nThe present-day China seems interested in reaching out to as many countries as possible because it aspires to be recognised and felt as a global power. Its endeavour to rediscover South Asian culture and heritage as part of its extending connectivity mission is quite natural. Indeed, President Xi Jinping’s China has tried to hone both hard and soft power capabilities by adopting a dualistic approach to upgrading its foreign policy objectives. Since China’s soft power competitive smartness is comparatively weaker than that of the Western powers, especially its fierce competitor, the United States of America, it seems to develop a level of connectivity in multiple areas—culture, history, infrastructure building and even political influence. Thus, this article captures such aspects that not only try to revisit the old links but also to rekindle the hope of bringing South Asians closer to the people of China. Language, civilisational commonalities and trade prospects are essential for promoting such cultural and other connectivity linkages.China is a “civilisation state” with a strong imperial political tradition. The present view of the nation-state, which is very much tempered by its cultural heritage, took its form only in the 19th century. Confucian and Lao Tzu’s thoughts, believed to have maintained harmony and peace within the broad Chinese society, still prevail. “Confucian world”, to quote Martin Jacques, “is a world without border” urging the Chinese people to “reconstruct Confucian orthodoxy and Confucian view of the world that all Under-Heavan is one family”. In the past, all imperial dynasties in China upheld the idea of “Under-Heavan”, which has, as of today, given rise to maintaining harmony among the various nations (Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan and Han). The Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities of Xinjiang Province sometimes show their separate identity, but China is more or less a homogenous country despite more than 92 percent domination of Han people. As a result of such a long cultural heritage, the process of political acculturation is accordingly shaped, given the one-party rule seldom brings forth discordant views of people. The increasing acceptability of Buddhism in China has also made the connectivity agenda easier, as it is said that about 25 percent of Chinese embrace Buddhism. Taking it as a significant area for expanding Chinese soft power, the Communist regime has made it a component of Chinese foreign policy, contrary to the communist formulation of religion as the opium of people. South Asia, by contrast, is hierarchical due to its dominant caste stratification system, which has prevailed for over four thousand years. The dominant Hindu religion, accompanied by caste hierarchy, continues. However, Buddhism, which does not accept many Hindu rituals and customs features, is the most important connecting factor. Today, the doctrine of peaceful co-existence, peace as a component of foreign policies of all, has further reinforced this connectivity. The Trans Himalayan cultural, political and economic links were established between the Nepal valley and China. The Jokhang temple was constructed 1,400 years ago by the artists of Kathmandu Valley. During the Lichhavi period in the Valley, Bhrikuti, the princess, was married to the King of Tibet. Similarly, Araniko is regarded as the best connecting factor between Nepal and China. In addition, many explorers actively discovered various cultural and religious places in India and Nepal. India, a major part of South Asia, was connected first in 67 AD by an Indian scholar, Kashayapa Matanga. Jawaharlal Nehru writes in The Discovery of India that “there was two-way traffic between India and China and many Chinese scholars came here”. Among them, Fa Hien, Sung Yun and Hsuan Tsang were prominent. Many Chinese scholars spent years at Nalanda University learning Buddhism.Such rich cultural links between South Asian countries and China were almost broken following the emergence of nation-states and the politicisation of borders, trade, tourism and pilgrimages. Although avenues of contact have been made easy, the “primacy of politics” has forestalled cooperation and peace. At a time when greater connectivity between the peoples of China and South Asia needs to be promoted, competitive power politics have created political barriers. A cultural forum held in Malaysia in September 2024 has emphasised the need for cooperation and understanding to establish civilisational links. It is stated that “Asian countries should make full use of the power of culture and civilization to support regional unity, openness and progress for a shared future”. Given the divergent political approaches to foreign and strategic policies of South Asian nations and the increasing impetus given to ultra-nationalism trends based on political bigotries, it would be difficult for China to navigate its overall relations with South Asia as a region. Since the very concept and practice of regionalism seems to be declining due to rivalries of big powers in the region, China's aspiration of upgrading cultural connectivity is likely to suffer a setback. Unless India, China and Pakistan achieve a certain level of political understanding, the prospects of cooperation, stability, unity and partnership will not be bright. Yet, amid conflict and cooperation, some of the mechanisms can be put in place for upgrading the level of connectivity. Culturally, South Asian people were/are exposed more to the West than to oriental culture because of colonialism. Western education and language promoted under the patronage of British colonial power could influence South Asian culture by mixing Western and Eastern cultures. Language, education, lifestyle, etc., have been tremendously shaped by the West. Moreover, Western political ideology was formed to such a great degree that the new elites of South Asia were/are more anglicised than the Westerners themselves. Historically, South Asia is an amalgam of different cultural traits, making a mixture of them all. To cite Nehru again, “A synthesis worked itself out: new styles of architecture arose, food and clothing changed, and life was affected and varied in many others”. Islam enriched the culture much earlier than the coming of the Muslim rulers in India. Such rich synthesis that exists even today can be useful for connecting it to the Chinese cultural tradition formed in the same manner as in South Asia.  \nNepal's community forestry (CF) initiative, once celebrated globally as a model for sustainable forest management, is now at a critical turning point. Launched in the early 1990s, CF aimed to conserve forests and improve local livelihoods. For many rural families, forests provided fuel, fodder and timber. Over the past 30 years, CF has evolved from small-scale, subsistence-focused practices into more diverse management approaches, reflecting changing local needs and broader policy agendas. Yet, increasing dissatisfaction among local politicians, forestry authorities and community members has emerged due to the programme's declining effectiveness. While CF was successful in the past, its impact on livelihoods has not reached its full potential, and once-active forest user groups have become passive with the changes in socioeconomic conditions.This does not mean the community-based approach is outdated. Core principles, such as devolving forest rights and community-based forest management, remain relevant. However, the current challenge is whether CF can adapt to become more market-oriented and climate-resilient while maintaining equity and sustainability. Urgent reforms are needed, as CF in Nepal faces significant obstacles due to major changes in rural dynamics. Without timely recognition of these issues and appropriate interventions, CF risks failure. Rather than focusing solely on subsistence, CF must tap into its economic potential in two key areas.Sustainable forest resource harvestCF can realise its economic potential through sustainable timber and forest resource harvesting. Over the past decade, Nepal’s involvement in global climate agreements, such as the UNFCCC, has increased the importance of forest management in national climate mitigation strategies. Despite this, the declining contribution of forests to household economies has weakened community members’ incentives to invest in forest management. Sustainable timber harvesting could generate much-needed revenue to reinvest in community and forest development projects.However, several challenges have slowed progress in sustainable timber harvesting. The government introduced scientific forest management to generate revenue through sustainable practices by boosting timber production and employment. Yet, this initiative was criticised for forest exploitation, governance concerns and a \"one-size-fits-all\" strategy that ignored local conditions. Eventually, stakeholder opposition and a lack of scientific evidence led to its failure.A more effective strategy would be categorising community forests based on specific objectives. For example, forests in the productive Terai region could focus on timber production, while those in more inaccessible hill and mountain regions could prioritise conservation, ecotourism, non-timber forest products, high-value medicinal herbs and even Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation ( REDD+) initiatives. The CF has successfully restored degraded forests but has struggled with governance and institutional capacity. The dissolution of scientific forest management guidelines further complicates matters, as the absence of national standards has hindered tree harvesting. Additionally, the high costs of harvesting in challenging terrain, combined with poor forest management practices such as improper tending, frequent forest fires, insect infestations and old tree retention, have degraded the quality of local timber, making it difficult to compete with imports like Malaysian wood.To address these challenges, Nepal’s forest management must blend art and science to maximise economic benefits. Managing forests as enterprises, establishing wood treatment centres to enhance timber durability, setting up softwood processing units and creating small-scale plywood and veneer mills are essential steps toward revitalising community forestry and making it economically viable.REDD+ and carbon creditsWhen protection-oriented policies limit revenue generation from forest products, alternative funding mechanisms like payments for ecosystem services through REDD+ should be explored. REDD+ compensates countries for verified emission reductions, typically through carbon credits. Nepal has made notable progress with the development of the National REDD+ Strategy, the Benefit Sharing Plan and the establishment of the REDD Implementation Centre. However, these efforts alone are not enough to position Nepal as a reliable supplier of carbon credits in the global market. To remain competitive, Nepal must address both internal and external factors limiting its ability to fully benefit from these markets.Internally, Nepal faces challenges such as unstable leadership within institutions managing REDD+ and a lack of adaptability in governance. Consistent leadership is crucial for continuity, efficient decision-making, resource allocation, and effective utilisation of REDD+ revenue. Equally important for Nepal is transitioning from grants to developing strategies that attract private-sector investment. With the voluntary carbon market projected to grow from $2 billion to $50 billion by 2030, the country must set long-term goals to ensure its forest-dependent communities can tap into this form of growth led by the private sector.Externally, Nepal’s unique circumstances make it difficult to generate substantial carbon credits. The country does not qualify as a High Forest, Low Deforestation (HFLD) country and lacks the high deforestation rates needed to produce significant emission reduction credits under REDD+. Global carbon markets tend to favour tropical countries like Brazil and Indonesia, with higher deforestation rates.Three primary standards govern jurisdictional-level carbon credits: ART’s TREES, Verra’s VCS JNR and the FCPF Carbon Fund. With the FCPF Carbon Fund ending in 2025 and Verra’s VCS JNR focusing solely on emission reductions, ART’s TREES will be the only standard permitting removal credits at the jurisdictional level. Nepal is part of the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance (LEAF) coalition, which follows the REDD+ Environmental Excellence Standard TREES standard. Under this standard, countries can generate removal credits only if their emissions during the crediting period are lower than the average emissions from deforestation and degradation over the previous five years.Although Nepal has made significant progress in forest restoration, it may face challenges in claiming removal credits. Since emissions from deforestation and degradation are already low, even a small change in forest activity could cause emissions to exceed the historical baseline, resulting in the loss of removal credits. This situation might unintentionally penalise Nepal for its forest conservation efforts and make it harder to benefit from the global REDD+ programme.Nepal must reform its policies, restructure community-level governance, practice active forest management, build capacity, strengthen leadership and adopt a forward-looking approach that embraces its forests’ economic and environmental potential. By doing so, the country can ensure that its forests continue providing economic and environmental benefits while maintaining core principles of sustainability and equity. Without these reforms, Nepal risks missing out on the significant benefits that community forestry can offer in the years ahead. \nIs Nepal on the verge of becoming another Sri Lanka? Questions of these motifs were common in Nepal’s public debate sphere after Sri Lanka defaulted on its sovereign debt in April 2022. Around the same period, another South Asian nation—Pakistan—had difficulty servicing its foreign debt. While the doomsday predictions of Nepal becoming another Sri Lanka turned out far-fetched, can the debt distress experienced by Sri Lanka and Pakistan offer lessons for Nepal’s public finances? A closer investigation of public debt in three countries—Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka—offers some answers. First, these three South Asian nations differ markedly in their public debt levels and other public finance characteristics. While assessed as having a low risk of debt distress, Nepal has witnessed a surge in its public debt holding, from about 25 percent of GDP in the fiscal year 2014-15 to 42.7 percent in 2023-24. However, despite the peculiarities of every nation, some common patterns let us draw a few lessons.Fiscal profligacy to serve short-term political gains is at the heart of the public debt woes. For instance, Sri Lanka aggressively used foreign loans obtained at a high cost to finance development projects and social welfare to fulfil election pledges and appease the voters. Even when the debt accumulation was spiralling out of control, the government failed to make timely adjustments and instead opted for counter-intuitive tax cuts in 2019. Covid-19 halted Pakistan’s tourism, a critical foreign reserve source. Moreover, policies such as a ban on imports of chemical fertilisers caused a decline in agricultural production and exports, hastening the debt crisis. However, the crucial factor was a long history of fiscal indiscipline, resulting in chronic budget deficits. Likewise, Pakistan also opted for persistent budget deficits to finance development projects, often without adequate preparation and evaluation, and other politically convenient measures, such as untargeted energy subsidies and significant fiscal support to large but inefficient state-owned enterprises. The rapid accumulation of public debt in Nepal is partly due to fiscal profligacy—running persistent budget deficits to finance government expenditures, including wasteful recurrent expenditures and investments in development projects that have not undergone adequate preparations. Similarly, untargeted social security expenditures motivated by electoral considerations rather than sound assessments are rampant in the country.Another important lesson is that the external finance landscape changes as the country climbs the income ladder. There is a gradual increase in the cost of external borrowing as the sources of concessional financing dry up or are inadequate to fuel higher development aspirations. For instance, when Sri Lanka upgraded to a middle-income country and entered the international capital market in 2007, its share of non-concessional loans was less than 20 percent. However, as its income increased, so did its borrowings from high-interest foreign sources, also called international sovereign bonds. The share of non-concessional loans increased to more than 50 percent of its total loans. Pakistan has also seen a declining share of multilateral creditors in its external loan portfolio and an increasing concentration of bilateral creditors (primarily Chinese loans) and commercial creditors. Until now, Nepal has relied exclusively on concessional loans for external finance. It would be wise to tread a cautious path, as the country has recently graduated to a lower-middle-income category in the World Bank’s classification and is poised to graduate from the least-developed country category in 2026.A closer investigation into the public debt of these nations also indicates that the Chinese debt-trap narrative—observations that China burdens developing countries with unsustainable debt—is perhaps overblown. The experience of Pakistan and Sri Lanka suggests that loans from China did add to the debt burden—as the interest rates are higher than that of concessional loans obtained from multilateral sources—evidence suggests that Chinese loans were obtained at interest rates lower than that of international capital markets. In Sri Lanka’s case, Chinese loans constituted a lower share of the external debt and debt servicing than what was owed to other sources, such as international capital markets. The biggest issue with loans from China seems to be non-transparency rather than its volumes and servicing costs. Debt crises can occur at different levels of public debt. In the case of Sri Lanka, the crisis occurred when its debt to GDP was higher than 100 percent of GDP, but regarding Pakistan, debt financing difficulties were seen at a much lower level—at around 75 percent of GDP. A literature survey on public debt sustainability also shows no agreed-upon debt sustainability threshold. Moreover, the critically acclaimed book This Time is Different, written by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, points out that debt defaults have occurred at levels below 40 percent of the Gross National Product. Hence, the current debt levels should not create complacency that stalls public finance reforms. Public debt, in certain instances, is indispensable, and its just use can be instrumental in the development of a country and the welfare of its citizens. However, considering Sri Lanka and Pakistan’s experiences, it is also true that mismanagement of public finances can inflict significant pain on ordinary citizens and lead the economy down a path below its potential for a long time. Hence, it is imperative that Nepal put its public finances in order. The right time to do that is now when the crisis is not imminent.  \nCuba’s electrical grid collapsed again on Sunday, the fourth such failure in 48 hours, with a hurricane making landfall to compound the island’s misery and threaten further havoc on its decrepit infrastructure.Cuba earlier on Sunday had said it was making headway restoring service after multiple false starts, though millions of people remained without electricity more than two days after the grid’s initial collapse.“Restoration work began immediately,” the country’s energy and mines ministry said on X.Hurricane Oscarmade landfall on the Caribbean island on Sunday, bringing strong winds, a powerful storm surge and rain to parts of eastern Cuba and threatening to further complicate the government’s efforts to reestablish service.Cuba’s meteorological survey warned of “an extremely dangerous situation” in eastern Cuba, while the US National Hurricane Center reported winds of 75 miles per hour (120 kph) as the storm made its way across the island.“On the forecast track, the centre of Oscar is expected to continue moving across eastern Cuba tonight and Monday, then emerge off the northern coast of Cuba late Monday and cross the central Bahamas on Tuesday,” the Hurricane Center said.The Communist-run government cancelled school through Wednesday - a near unprecedented move in Cuba - citing the hurricane and the ongoing energy crisis. Officials said only essential workers should report to work on Monday.The repeated grid collapses marked a major setback in the government’s efforts to quickly restore power to exhausted residents already suffering from severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.The multiple setbacks in the first 48 hours also underscored the complexity of the work and the still precarious state of the country’s grid.Cuba had restored power to 160,000 clients in Havana just prior to the grid’s Sunday collapse, giving some residents a glimmer of hope.But housewife Anabel Gonzalez, of old Havana, a neighbourhood popular with tourists, said she was growing desperate after three days without power.“My cell phone is dead and look at my refrigerator. The little that I had has all gone to waste,” she said, pointing to bare shelves in her two-room home.Energy and mines minister Vicente de la O Levy told reporters earlier on Sunday he expected the grid to be fully functional by Monday or Tuesday but warned residents not to expect dramatic improvements.It was not immediately clear how much the latest setback would delay the government’s efforts.Cuba’s national electrical grid first crashed around midday on Friday after the island's largest power plant shut down, sowing chaos. The grid collapsed again on Saturday morning, state-run media reported.By early evening on Saturday, authorities reported some progress restoring power before announcing another partial grid collapse.RISING TENSIONSReuters reporters witnessed two small protests overnight after a grid failure left Havana in the dark late Saturday, one on the outskirts of the capital in Marianao and the other in the more central Cuatro Caminos. Various videos of protests elsewhere in the capital began to crop up on social media late on Saturday, though Reuters was not able to verify their authenticity.Energy Minister O Levy said the blackouts were bothersome to residents, but he said most Cubans understood and supported government efforts to restore power.“It is Cuban culture to cooperate,”O Levy told reporters on Sunday. “Those isolated and minimal incidents that do exist, we catalog them as incorrect, as indecent.”Internet traffic dropped off sharply in Cuba over the weekend, according to data from internet monitoring group NetBlocks, as vast power outages made it all but impossible for most island residents to charge phones and get online.“Network data show that Cuba remains largely offline as the island experiences a second nationwide power outage,” Netblocks said on Saturday.The government has blamed weeks of worsening blackouts - as long as 10 to 20 hours a day across much of the island - on deteriorating infrastructure, fuel shortages and rising demand.Cuba also blames the US trade embargo, as well as sanctions instituted by then-President Donald Trump, for ongoing difficulties in acquiring fuel and spare parts to operate and maintain its oil-fired plants.The US has denied any role in the grid failures.Cuba depends on imports to feed its largely obsolete, oil-fired power plants. Fuel deliveries to the island have dropped significantly this year as Venezuela, Russia and Mexico, once important suppliers, have slashed their exports to Cuba.Ally Venezuela - struggling to supply its own market - cut by half its deliveries of subsidized fuel to Cuba this year, forcing the island to search for more costly oil on the spot market.Mexico, another frequent supplier, appeared also to have cut fuel flows to Cuba during a presidential election year.Recently elected President Claudia Sheinbaum has not said if the state-supported supply to Cuba will continue under same terms under her administration. \nToday the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in Lumbini Province and the hilly regions of the country and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at one or two places of Lumbini Province and hilly regions of the country.The Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast chances of light snowfall at one or two places of the high hilly and mountainous region of the country.Tonight the weather will be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country. Light rain or thunder and lightning is likely to occur at one or two places of the hilly region of the country.According to the Meteorological Analysis, the current weather conditions are primarily influenced by the westerly wind system, which has an effect across the country, along with some impact from local winds.On Sunday, Dhangadhi recorded the highest maximum temperature at 34°C, while Jumla experienced the lowest minimum temperature at 7.5°C. \nThe torment began when she started Primary 1, and ended only when she left the school two years later.New to a popular all-girls school, a seven-year-old quickly became a target of bullying by more than one group of her peers. A few pupils spread rumours that she had cheated in her exams, while another threw rubbish into her school bag, crushed her homework, licked her snacks and hid her stationery.A teacher took away an award she had earned for doing well in an assignment because of remarks that other girls had made, and she had to put a padlock on her bag to protect her belongings.“I noticed something was wrong when my daughter was crying more often,” said her mother, Mrs Rachel Tan (not her real name), a housewife in her early 50s.Mrs Tan and her daughter both struggled to raise these encounters to teachers or the school, as there was no hard evidence. And when Mrs Tan tried to talk to a teacher about the rumours other girls had spread, nothing came of it.At one point, Mrs Tan had to help her daughter practise how to defend herself in school. “I imagined helping her practise for oral exams, but not to stand up to her bullies.”Her daughter escaped her bullies after moving to a new school in 2024, where she is doing better and has made new friends, Mrs Tan said. But she worries that the experience has left her child emotionally scarred and that she may not easily trust people or form friendships.While the number of bullying incidents reported to the Ministry of Education (MOE) has been stable in the past decade, observers say teenage bullying is a growing concern, especially with new tools of social media and texting that have opened up ways for bullies to hurt people.Technology has also drawn attention to cases of physical bullying that emerge online. Most recently in 2024, videos of at least three cases were widely circulated online and in chat groups.One video uploaded in September shows a boy punching a smaller Qihua Primary Schoolboy.Another video, which surfaced in September, shows a group of Bukit View Secondary School boys taunting a fellow student at the void deck of a Housing Board flat. During the incident, which happened in 2023, one of the boys grabbed the student’s backpack before kicking him and sending him flying.In August, videos posted on Facebook show people being slapped, punched and kicked at ITE College Central.In October, Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Zaobao reported that a Secondary 1 student from Meridian Secondary School suffered a rupture in her right eardrum after her schoolmates allegedly slapped and hit her for 20 minutes. About two in every 1,000 primary school pupils report bullying incidents each year, and the figure for secondary school students is five in every 1,000, said MOE, without disclosing exact figures. But observers told The Straits Times that these statistics may not fully reflect the extent of the problem, because children fear the possibility of retaliation from bullies and may not fully understand what they are going through.Physical bullying incidents are the tip of the iceberg, they said. Other forms of aggression like psychological or verbal bullying – offline and online – often go undetected, as these are less obvious, and children feel they may not warrant the same level of attention.“Children can worry about appearing petty to their teachers and classmates,” said Ms Sandy Ho, a counsellor from MindfulBear, a private centre that specialises in counselling for children and teenagers. This often results in them choosing to keep quiet and ignoring the issue, she added.Hidden violence, but harmfulAnother parent, who wanted to be known only as Madam M, said her 10-year-old child tolerated her schoolmates’ taunting for almost a year.She said they said words like “oh sh*t” when her daughter walked past them, whispered and pointed at her, and bad-mouthed her to others in front of her. One girl also kicked her daughter in the shin.Madam M, who is in her 40s, said she did not report the psychological bullying as her daughter had pleaded with her not to, citing reasons like fear of retaliation.The bullies continued ganging up on her daughter and gave her phone number to strangers, getting them to send vulgar and harassing messages to her.It was only when Madam M said she would make a police report that teachers took action. In the meantime, her child was told to be gracious and take different routes in school to avoid the other girls.The bullies were told to write apology letters, which her daughter accepted.“Psychological bullying is very easily deniable and there are no bruises as proof,” said Madam M. “But it should be taken as seriously as physical bullying.”Ms Jane Lim, lead school counsellor from MOE’s guidance branch, Student Development Curriculum Division 1, said that students are taught the channels for reporting bullying incidents.But some may feel unsafe reporting these incidents as they worry about retaliation, she added. “Older students may choose not to report incidents to teachers, and instead seek help from their peers or attempt to resolve the situations on their own,” Ms Lim said.“We frequently remind our students that it is okay to notify teachers and seek help if they are being bullied, or have noticed their friends being bullied.”She added that teachers are trained to identify signs of distress and can support students, some of whom may be referred to a school counsellor.In Secondary 1 and 2, Ms Laurene Chung endured verbal bullying in school that followed her home, in the form of hateful anonymous comments on Ask.fm, a question and answer network, and on social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.Ms Chung, now 25, said: “I had no escape. They told me I was ugly, and started nitpicking parts of my face, like my eyebrows.”A group of five or six female students would pick on her and corner her after morning assembly, not allowing her to go to class. This happened a few times a week.“I feared going to school,” she said. “Until now, I’m not sure what motivated them to pick on me.”In her darkest moments, her confidant was her younger brother, who held her hand as she cried in bed at night.Ms Chung said she did not want her parents to know she was being bullied so as not to worry them. She also did not tell her teachers, for fear that the bullying would worsen or that word would get back to her parents.“Most of my recovery was me reminding myself that it will get better,” she said, and the bullying stopped in Secondary 3 after some girls transferred out of the school.What drives bullies?The causes of bullying are complex but connected, said Ms Ho, the counsellor.Social factors like peer pressure may push people to bully others to gain acceptance or show dominance, while cultural influences – such as aggression depicted in the media – result in children being less aware of the harm they cause, she said.Some who have self-esteem or emotional issues use bullying to feel “in control”, Ms Ho added. Others may have grown up in a violent household, and are more likely to mimic such behaviours. Children in a school environment with “poor supervision and weak anti-bullying measures” may also not understand how their actions hurt others, she said.“Addressing these causes needs a joint effort from families, schools and communities to create a supportive environment that discourages bullying and promotes empathy,” she added.Associate Professor of Psychology (Education) Andree Hartanto from the School of Social Sciences at Singapore Management University said research has shown that cyber-bullying victims are likely to become cyber-bullying perpetrators in the future.“Unlike traditional bullying, which often involves physical disparities – where stronger children or adolescents target physically weaker ones – cyberbullying occurs in the digital realm. This lack of physical confrontation allows victims to become bullies more easily themselves, as they are no longer hindered by physical disadvantage.”Bullying can leave lasting emotional scars, he said.“These emotional traumas can escalate into ongoing issues with self-worth and more serious mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.“Tackling the root causes of bullying requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses both the individual needs of the bully and the broader social context in which bullying occurs,” he added.-In association with the Asia News Network \nAfter the Nepal Police arrested Rabi Lamichhane, the president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the former deputy prime minister, on Friday for his alleged involvement in the misuse of cooperative funds, people are now asking what will happen to Nepali Congress Vice President Dhanaraj Gurung and CPN-UML lawmaker Rishikesh Pokharel, who are also accused in similar offences.Supporters of Lamichhane took to the streets in Kathmandu and Pokhara, calling for the arrest of Gurung and Pokharel. They held placards with the names of Lamichhane, Gurung and Pokharel, questioning whether the ruling party lawmakers would also be arrested. Lamichhane is currently in the custody of the District Police Office, Kaski after a complaint was lodged against him for allegedly misusing funds from the Suryadarshan Cooperative in Pokhara. He is also being investigated for organised crime.However, the Department of Cooperatives has said no complaints have been filed regarding the alleged misuse of cooperative funds by Gurung and Pokharel. “Our department has not received any complaints against the cooperatives involving Gurung and Pokharel,” Tol Raj Upadhyaya, the spokesperson of the Department of Cooperatives, told the Post. “Complaints related to cooperatives are reported at the provincial or local level as well, so if there are complaints against them, they may have been filed there.” The information officer of the Ministry of Industry, Agriculture, and Cooperative of Koshi Province, Lila Ballav Chapagain, said no complaints have been registered against Pokharel and his wife, Anjala Koirala, at the provincial level. Chapagain also said that the cooperative organisation concerned is currently not functional.UML leader Pokharel, who chairs the Federal Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, has also been accused of embezzling cooperative funds. His wife, Anjala, previously served on the board of Umagauri Agricultural Cooperative as a director. She is accused of embezzling Rs140 million from the organisation located at Karsiya Baza in ward 4 of Dhanpal Nath Rural Municipality in Morang. The cooperative is now defunct.Pokharel has been denying any wrongdoing by himself or his wife. “My wife was merely a witness when some other people from the cooperative took out loans, but this fact has been distorted to cover up the wrongdoings of others,” Pokharel claimed.“I will defend myself when the new session of the Parliament starts. However, I am also open to an investigation if the state agency wants.” Pokharel said that he, as the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, raised concerns about corruption in various sectors and claimed that those under investigation have orchestrated a false narrative against him and his wife. He claimed that the CPN (Maoist Centre) was orchestrating the schemes against him and his wife. Pokharel’s claim holds some water, as he was targeted by the CPN (Maoist Centre) amid escalating tensions within the government. In July, the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) cut off power to six industrial firms that failed to pay the tariff for using a specialised feeder and trunk line for electricity. For days, despite a written order from the Electricity Regulatory Commission and the verbal instructions from Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, NEA chief Kulman Ghising refused to restore power to the six firms. After a conflict arose between NEA chief Ghising and Prime Minister Oli, the Public Accounts Committee, headed by Pokharel, raised the issue of corruption at the NEA. In response, leaders of the Maoist Centre leaders brought up allegations of cooperative fraud, suggesting that Pokharel was attempting to deflect attention away from him.However, Maoist Centre chief whip Hitraj Pandey says that Pokharel and his wife's involvement in cooperative fraud did not come out of nowhere in the media.“But we fear that as the current government intends to take action against those not in its favour, it might protect those close to it,” Pandey told the Post. “Regarding Pokharel and his wife’s involvement in the cooperative fraud case, the parliamentary special probe committee, which submitted its report last month, also mentions them.”However, the report does not explicitly name Pokharel and his wife. “Since there were no complaints against them, our committee did not investigate Pokharel and his wife,” UML lawmaker Sarita Bhusal, who served as a member of the parliamentary special probe committee on cooperatives scam, told the Post.With no complaint lodged against UML lawmaker Pokharel and his wife, the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police has began investigating the alleged fraud involving the Miteri Savings and Credit Cooperative, which is connected to Congress Vice President Dhan Raj Gurung and his former wife, Jyoti Gurung. CIB spokesperson Hobindra Bogati said they are thoroughly reviewing the complaint against the Miteri Cooperatives. “We are investigating the complaint against Miteri Cooperative, where Dhanraj Gurung and his former wife are allegedly involved,” Bogati told the Post.After the cooperative’s chairman, Kumbharaj Gurung, filed a complaint with the Department of Cooperatives in August, alleging that Jyoti Gurung, the general manager, embezzled Rs12.5 million, Congress Vice-President Gurung also came under scrutiny. Jyoti Gurung is Dhanaraj Gurung's former wife.Gurung has denied his involvement in the scam, arguing that his former wife, with whom he no longer has a relationship, misappropriated the money, so he cannot be held accountable. Despite Gurung’s claim that he separated from his wife in 2019, Miteri Cooperative chair Kumbharaj reported he had registered a complaint against the Gurung duo and informed law enforcement agencies that the lawmaker continued to pay off the debts in his wife’s name until last year. Various copies of the vouchers Dhan Raj Gurung reportedly used to deposit money into the cooperative’s account have surfaced in various media outlets.After being charged with embezzling the cooperative's funds, Dhan Raj Gurung, speaking in Parliament on September 10, called for a proper investigation to clear his name. A parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives submitted its report last month. The committee also recommended investigating Gurung and his former wife for misusing the cooperative’s funds.  \nThe government has formed a high-level study and recommendation committee to develop a safe, reliable, and trustworthy civil aviation system in Nepal.According to Minister for Communication and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Cabinet, on Friday, decided to establish a five-member committee headed by former Supreme Court Justice Anil Kumar Sinha. “The committee is tasked with conducting a comprehensive study and analysis of Nepal’s civil aviation sector and providing recommendations to improve safety, reliability, and credibility,” he said.The Council of Ministers also approved the terms of reference of the committee. Other members of the committee include air traffic management expert Rajendra Bahadur Singh, aviation safety expert Bhesh Raj Subedi, air service operations and quality management expert Captain Riwaj Prasad Pradhan, and a Joint Secretary from the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation. \nThe Kaski District Court on Sunday remanded Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane into custody for six days for further investigation on charges of cooperative fund embezzlement and organised crime.Lamichhane was arrested by a team of the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) from his party office in Kathmandu on Friday. He was subsequently brought to Pokhara, where he was presented before the court on Sunday. The court, led by Judge Navaraj Dahal, granted permission for the six-day remand following a request from the police.Lamichhane, along with several other individuals, is accused of being involved in misappropriating funds from the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Savings and Credit Cooperative. The arrest followed a parliamentary probe which linked him and others to the embezzlement of millions of rupees from the cooperative.The court had previously issued arrest warrants against 14 individuals, with investigations being conducted into their involvement. So far, over 60 people have been implicated in the cooperative’s financial irregularities, with seven, including Gorkha Media Network’s director Chhabilal Joshi, held in custody pending trial.Meanwhile, protests have been staged both in favour of and against Lamichhane in Pokhara, with RSP supporters rallying for his release and cooperative victims demanding his detention for further investigation into the fraud allegations.The police remain on alert to prevent any escalation as parallel demonstrations continue.Earlier, District Administration Office, Kaski had issued a prohibitory order on Sunday afternoon to avoid a possible clash between the protesting parties. \nBillionaire Elon Musk promised on Saturday to give away $1 million each day until November’s election to someone who signs his online petition supporting the US Constitution.And he wasted no time, awarding a $1 million check to an attendee of his event in Pennsylvania aimed at rallying supporters behind Republican Donald Trump. The winner was a man named John Dreher, according to event staff.“By the way, John had no idea. So anyway, you’re welcome,” the Tesla founder said as he handed Dreher the check.The money is the latest example of Musk using his extraordinary wealth to influence the tightly contested presidential race between Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris.Musk started America PAC, a political action organization he founded in support of Trump’s presidential campaign. The group is helping mobilize and register voters in battleground states, but there are signs it is having trouble meeting its goals.The Harrisburg event is the third in as many days in Pennsylvania, where Musk is painting November’s election in stark terms and encouraging supporters to vote early and get others to do the same.He said on Saturday that if Harris wins, it will be “the last election,” suggesting the US will no longer exist.He also said the two assassination attempts against Trump prove he is ruffling feathers and upending the status quo in ways Harris won’t. He said that’s why no one is trying to kill Harris.“Assassinating a puppet is worthless, Musk,” said, reiterating an argument he has made in a social media post.The petition Musk is asking people to sign reads: “The First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below, I am pledging my support for the First and Second Amendments.”Attendees of Saturday’s event had to sign the petition, which allows America PAC to garner contact details for more potential voters that it can work to get to the polls for Trump.Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world's richest person, so far has supplied at least $75 million to America PAC, according to federal disclosures, making the group a crucial part of Trump’s bid to regain the White House.The entrepreneur behind carmaker Tesla and rocket and satellite venture SpaceX has increasingly supported Republican causes and this year became an outspoken Trump supporter.Trump in turn has said if elected he would appoint Musk to head a government efficiency commission. \nAmid widespread deaths and devastation caused by monsoon across various districts, Nepal is at a heightened risk for water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne disease outbreaks.With most water sources contaminated by rain and floodwater, and thousands of displaced people living in makeshift shelters, experts have warned of a potential surge in infections in the coming days.“People are already getting infected with water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “These problems could worsen in the coming days.” At least 209 people have been confirmed dead, while 29 others are still missing due to the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking torrential rainfall that started Thursday evening. Additionally, 142 people have sustained various degrees of injury, and more than 4,222 others have been taken to safe places, the Home Ministry said on Monday evening. Doctors warn that the risk of water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne disease outbreaks increases in the aftermath of disasters. Nepal’s past experiences suggest the same.“People are already contracting cholera and other water-borne diseases,” said Dr Pun. “As displaced people mostly live in temporary shelters, the chances of spread of air-borne and vector-borne diseases remain high.”At least 95 people from various districts, including from Kathmandu and Lalitpur, have tested positive for cholera since the start of the monsoon in June. The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Thousands of others were also infected with diarrheal infections after the start of the monsoon season. Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue, usually triggered by unsafe food and water or hygiene issues. Likewise, six people died, and 12,644 others were hospitalised this year due to dengue, which has spread to 76 out of 77 districts across the country. Hundreds of people are contracting seasonal flu, but health authorities have no records of these cases.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are bracing for tough days ahead, as the floodwaters not only contaminate drinking water sources but also create breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“We expect a surge in water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases in the coming days, as it takes a few days for these illnesses to incubate,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have alerted all agencies concerned to step up vigilance and prepare to deal with any adverse situations.”Public health experts have warned that healthcare facilities in the disaster-hit districts could witness an uptick in cases of viral fever cases and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning—and snakebites.Health Ministry officials say that they are aware of the risks and have directed agencies concerned to prepare accordingly.“We have stockpiled essential medicines in districts, provinces and at the central level,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, the secretary at the ministry. “Responding to the looming outbreaks is not only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but also of other ministries and agencies, and we have been coordinating with them as well.”In addition to stepping up surveillance measures, stockpiling medicines, and deploying medics at the health facilities in disaster-hit areas, public health experts emphasise the importance of health awareness in reducing infections.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the possible outbreaks of various ailments.The monsoon in Nepal is itself a season of epidemics with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.In recent years, scientists have gathered credible evidence linking the climate crisis to adverse health effects that impact the quality of life and kill people. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nThe government has reformed the recommendation committee tasked with nominating officials for two key transitional justice bodies: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. The decision was finalised during a Cabinet meeting held on Friday.According to Prithvi Subba Gurung, minister for communication and information technology, the restructured committee will be headed by former Chief Justice Om Prakash Mishra, and its members include former Attorney General Khamba Bahadur Khati, Arjun Kumar Karki, and Stella Tamang. Earlier, top leaders of major political parties including Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chair KP Oli, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Centre) Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal agreed to expedite the remaining tasks related to transitional justice.\"The restructuring aligns with agreements reached among senior political leaders, including Prime Minister Oli, to conclude long-standing transitional justice issues,\" Gurung said.Previously, a similar committee was formed in April but failed to function due to a lack of representation from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). This initiative comes as the two commissions face mounting pressure, with the TRC holding over 63,000 complaints and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons handling around 2,400 cases. Both commissions have been criticised for their inactivity since their inception in 2015. \nThe arrest of former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the chairman of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), has triggered widespread concerns and reactions from different political party leaders. A team of Nepal Police’s Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) arrested Lamichhane from the RSP’s headquarters in Banasthali, Kathmandu on Friday evening.Lamichhane was apprehended to investigate his alleged involvement in cooperative fraud and organised crime. He was subsequently taken by road to the District Police Office in Kaski.A seven-member parliamentary special committee formed in May to investigate the cooperatives scam recommended legal actions against Lamichhane and three other individuals for their involvement in cooperative frauds. He faces allegations of misappropriating funds from a cooperative while serving as the managing director of the Gorkha Media Network that ran now-defunct Galaxy 4k Television before joining politics in June 2022.While leaders of ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML have remained silent on his arrest, there has been a mixed reaction among other party leaders.Speaking with the Post, Nepali Congress spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat said that the investigation agencies arrested Lamichhane as per the finding and recommendation of the parliamentary probe committee.“The report is public now and it was signed by a member of the RSP too,” Mahat said. “Besides the report of the parliamentary committee, the investigating agencies might have collected additional evidence and that must have created a ground for the police to arrest Lamichhane.”Meanwhile, Surya Thapa, who led the parliamentary special committee to probe the crisis-ridden cooperatives, has criticised the RSP leadership for their reaction after Lamichhane’s arrest. RSP leaders have said that Lamichhane’s arrest was motivated by political vendetta. Likening their reaction to ‘an artless drama’, Thapa writes on Facebook, “After the ‘Clean Chit ra Safaai film’ flopped everywhere within a few days, a new artless drama is being staged—‘Vendetta!’”Thapa had earlier come down heavily on Lamichhane and other RSP leaders when they claimed that the committee’s probe could not establish his involvement in cooperative scams.After the Thapa-led committee submitted its report, Lamichhane and RSP leaders had claimed that the parliamentary committee had given a clean chit to him and his involvement in cooperatives fraud could not be established. But Thapa kept on challenging the claim.In the wake of Lamichhane’s arrest, RSP cadres staged protests in Kathmandu, Pokhara and other parts of the country on Saturday. Addressing the protests, the RSP leaders attacked the leadership of the present government. Some RSP leaders like vice-president Swarnim Wagle and acting spokesperson Manish Jha, among others, condemned Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, and Foreign Minister Arzu Rana, among others.Meanwhile, Deputy General Secretary of CPN (Maoist Centre) and former minister Barsha Man Pun has demanded the arrest of Nepali Congress vice-president Dhanraj Gurung and UML lawmaker Rishikesh Pokhrel, who is also the chair of Public Accounts Committee of the House of Representatives, two leaders who are also alleged to be involved in the cooperatives scam.Speaking with reporters in Rolpa, Pun said that Gurung and Pokhrel should not be exempted and there should not be double standards in arresting the alleged in the cooperatives scam. “Whatever is happening with Rabi Lamichhane should also happen with Gurung and Rishikesh,” Pun said, according to a statement issued by his private secretariat.Mahat, the Nepali Congress spokesperson, said that they are always open for any kind of investigation on Gurung. “Our party has never blocked any kind of investigation against him,” he said.Former Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai, who is also the chairman of Nepal Samajbadi Party, said that Lamichanne should cooperate in the police investigation but he has full sympathy for him.He said Lamichhane has to go through the investigation process even if there is no truth in the accusation he has faced. “I have my full sympathy for him as he himself has said that he would help in the investigation process,” Bhattarai said. “I think he has to help duly end the investigation process.” The former prime minister stated that because there is rule of law in a democracy, whoever is found guilty, big or small, should be punished.The Kaski district police will produce Lamichanne in court on Sunday. \nPolice on Friday evening arrested Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair and former deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane on the charges of cooperatives fraud and organised crime.If the investigating officers don’t add to the list of crimes, they need to complete the entire investigation within 60 days and then submit a report to the Kaski District Attorney’s Office. The attorney’s office will then lodge the case in the Kaski District Court. However, if the police probe him for money laundering, too, they will have an additional 30 days to wrap up the investigation.Based on complaints from depositors at the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, the police apprehended the journalist-turned-politician to probe his involvement in the embezzlement of millions of rupees of public money. The district court will decide whether he is guilty of the allegations.If found guilty on both counts, he can face a jail term of over a decade. But if convicted of money laundering, he will not be able to return to parliamentary politics, as per existing legal provisions. However, he can challenge the district court’s decision in a higher court. The Supreme Court’s ruling will be final.The Cooperatives Act defines cooperatives fraud and prescribes jail terms and penalties. Clause 50 of the Act prohibits lending—or investing—cooperatives’ deposits to those who are not members. Various studies, including by the Parliamentary Special Committee, have found that money from Suryadarshan Cooperative was channelled to the Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane was once the managing director.If his involvement is established in transferring the money, he can face a year in jail and Rs100,000 in fine, as per Clause 124 (a) of the Act. Similarly, the RSP supremo may be prosecuted for causing harm to the cooperative, which is a criminal offence, according to Clause 122 (k) of the Act.If found guilty, Lamichhane faces 8 to 10 years of prison, along with a fine equal to the amount the cooperative suffered in losses. In addition, property equal to the amount can be confiscated from him.Being convicted of cooperatives’ fraud will pause his parliamentary politics for six years. The Act Relating to the Election of the Member of House of Representatives says a person convicted of a crime with less than 20 years of jail term is ineligible to contest election for six years after the completion of the imprisonment. The same provision applies to other elections as well.“Lamichhane will not be eligible to contest at least one election if he gets convicted in cooperatives’ fraud,” said Mohan Lal Acharya, a constitutional lawyer.The penalty for organised crime is still higher. The Prevention of the Organised Crime Act 2013 says that if any crime is found to be conducted in an organised manner, imprisonment can increase by 50 percent. In that case, Lamichhane can face a maximum jail term of 12 to 15 years. Just as with cooperatives’ fraud, in this case too he would have to wait for six years after completing the sentence to make a comeback in parliamentary politics.Lamichhane, however, can never come back to politics if he gets convicted of money laundering. Along with money laundering, those convicted of corruption, rape, human trafficking, passport misuse and abduction are not allowed to contest elections.However, those who have already been elected as members of Parliament will not lose their positions. They only remain suspended. As per the House of Representatives regulations, no lawmaker is suspended until s/he faces judicial custody or is convicted. So, Lamichhane will remain a member of the lower house until he is sent to judicial custody.He will not lose the position even if he is convicted of the crimes he is charged with. “Any lawmaker convicted in any criminal offence will remain suspended during the period of his/her jail term,” reads section 248 (4) of the regulation. Even as such lawmakers do not lose their position, they don’t get any pay and perks during their suspension period. \nChairman of CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Netra Bikram Chand, general secretary of Nepal Community Party, shared a stage in Bharatpur, Chitwan on Saturday and underscored the need for party unification among all the Maoist outfits in the country. Attending a programme organised at Bharatpur Metropolitan City-13, Dahal and Chand jointly urged all the Maoist groups to make a stronger political force in the present context of Nepal.“I will move forward for party unity unequivocally,” said Dahal, the former prime minister and parliamentary party leader of the main opposition party in the House of Representatives. “We will have to regain the political strength the party had in 2008 [during the first election of Constituent Assembly].”The then CPN (Maoist) led by Dahal was the largest party in the first Constituent Assembly election held in 2008. The party later split into various outfits including the Chand-led Nepal Communist Party. Speaking at the programme, Dahal appealed to participants to make a united Maoist party by the upcoming general election of 2027.Similarly, Chand also emphasised for unity among the Maoist parties to resolve the current political problems in the country. “If all the Maoist parties come together and contest the upcoming general election, the united party will be as it was in the Constituent Assembly election in 2008,” Chand said. He urged all the Maoist breakaway factions not to criticise one another but to move forward united for the welfare of the country and people.In another context, Chand lambasted the Rastriya Swatantra Party led by Rabi Lamichhane, who is currently in police custody on charges of cooperative fraud and organised crime. He said the party “established overnight” has confused the people. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nUntil two years ago, growing crops was a big challenge for farmer Jit Bahadur Khamcha Magar of Palpa in western Nepal. He had been a victim of the monkey menace for years. But these days Magar of Phek Dangsinghdanda, Ribdikot rural municipality-8 is not much worried. He plans to earn Rs700,000 from the same land which until two years ago yielded nothing because monkeys, including other wild animals, ate up all the crops. Some farmers even left the village.Magar's life suddenly changed after he started growing chillies. Monkeys don’t like chillies and they don't even come close to the crop. Till October, he sold chillies worth Rs 350,000 and plans to double the income by the end of this year. He has cultivated round chillies on three ropanies of land.“Previously, the crops were destroyed by monkeys, porcupines, boars and other animals. My income was just zero two years back,” said Magar. “This year, I expect a good earning as the chilli variety I’ve grown is highly demanded in the market.”Bishnu Bahadur Karki from Bhairabstan, Ribdikot rural municipality-4 hopes to earn Rs800,000 this year from round chilies. He has already made nearly a half of that. He still plans to earn Rs450,000 from the sales of round chillies.Karki, who has cultivated round chillis on six ropanis, said that the price of round chillies has nearly doubled this year.“We have not only got the value for our products, but market access too,” said Karki. “As the price is fixed in advance, it is less risky for farmers.”Besides Magar and Karki, nearly 1,500 farmers from Ribdikot rural municipality-8 are making an income from the crop. Ribdikot, once known for ginger production, now sees a future in round chilli cultivation.Round chillies were primarily cultivated in Ilam, Panchthar, Dhakuta of the east. Four years ago, round chillies were planted in Ribdikot as a trial but later the rural municipality earned more than Rs60 million from the commodity, and encouraged more farmers to grow the crop in a commercial way.With the increase in the value of round chilli this year, farmers easily managed the expenses for their festivities.“We used to take loans to celebrate festivals. But with the round chilli farming boom, we need no loans from anyone,” said Sita Khamcha of Phake, Ribdikot rural municipality. She hopes to earn Rs500,000 from round chillies.Last year, round chillies fetched Rs150 per kg but this year the minimum price has been set at Rs220 per kg. The floor price was set in coordination with Ribdikot rural municipality, said Sita. Farmers are getting Rs260 per kg.Farmers said the market is no problem for round chillies—both red and green varieties. Narayan Bahadur GC, a former ward chairman, is the director of Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udyog. He introduced round chillies to local farmers with the support from the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation Project. “In Palpa, it is now grown commercially,” said GC. Initially, there was no certainty whether the output would be good, he added. Janak Acharya of Palungmainadi who cultivated round chillies on 200 ropanies as trial.Round chilli cultivation expanded after the local government encouraged farmers in every ward, providing them with training and subsidies in seed purchase.GC is working on the marketing of round chillies.The Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udyog collects round chillies from farmers, ensures its market and grades the output. Production of green chillies starts from May. This facilitation has encouraged farmers to engage in round chilli farming, said Ranjib Kunwar, manager of Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udhyog.Kunwar said that most of the farmers bring their chilies to the factory. The farmers who do not take round chillies to the factory also make transactions of Rs10.5 million separately by selling them in the market. Traders supply round chillies to Butwal, Bhairahawa, Tansen and Pokhara.Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udhyog sells red round chillies to noodle producers.Farmers of Ribdikot hope to earn Rs60 million from round chillies this year.So far, farmers have already sold round chillies for more than Rs30 million.Though the rural municipality supported round chilli cultivation in initial days, lately it has been providing subsidies in seeds only. \nA couple from Baglung has found their calling in baking bread and pastries.Deepak Gautam and his wife Sanam start early each day at 5 am. Deepak personally delivers bread, pastries, doughnuts, and puffs to grocery shops, hotels, and restaurants. Once he returns in the afternoon, he gets back to baking.Deepak supplies bread to 120 grocery stores daily. The secret to their success lies in their disciplined routine. He rarely gets a chance to rest because he works tirelessly throughout the day—rain or shine. For the past eight years, Gautam has operated a bread factory at Shivadhara Chowk in ward 2 of Baglung Municipality, while the couple lives in ward 7.In a time when many youths are migrating abroad and see no future in Nepal, the story of Deepak, 37, and Sanam, 30, stands out as exceptional.The couple has been making bread with 50 kg of refined flour daily. They have hired three workers in the factory. They also run a shop at the factory where customers frequently order birthday cakes. On some days, they receive as many as 20 birthday cake orders. They make around Rs24,000 daily from their ‘The Star Bakery’ and its popularity continues to grow.“People used to view tea and bread shops differently in the past. However, it’s changing now as bakeries have become commercial and an integral part of daily life and celebrations,” said Deepak. Deepak is proud of his work as he has set an example that hard work pays off.Recently, he has started baking Korean bread, a skill he picked while working as a migrant worker in Korea. After returning to Nepal, he opened a tea shop in partnership with his elder brother Tulasi.Named ‘Pragati Pratibha Chiya Pasal’, a tea shop is now run by his wife and his sister-in-law (Tulasi's wife) and has become quite popular. It serves hundreds of cups of tea daily.Deepak has been operating the bakery business for the past eight years.Although there are a few other bakeries in the district, and all have been doing well, The Star Bakery stands out, according to retailers.“There are many bakeries, but most consumers ask for products from The Star Bakery,” said Khagendra Poudel, a local retailer. Known for his gentle demeanour, Deepak personally delivers bakery items to shops and homes. He has earned respect for his integrity as he carefully keeps a record of goods delivered to shop and collects payments occasionally.“Deepak accepts payment only after the sale of bakery items and takes back unsold items,” said Tal Bahadur Kunwar, a local hotelier. “The bakery products are excellent. People love them.”Retailers and entrepreneurs appreciate Deepak's flexibility in allowing them to pay after the products are sold.Initially, Deepak faced struggles. He used to bake bread using a traditional fire oven called Bhatti, which caused smoke pollution in the neighbourhood. So using his savings from five years of work in South Korea, he invested in a modern factory and installed an electric oven.“I used to work in different sectors while in Korea, but volunteered at a nearby bakery shop and learned the skill.”He invested Rs1 million in an oven and another Rs1.5 million in flour-mixing machines. He also built a home and bought a motorbike for deliveries. Despite these investments, his funds were not enough. But he received support from his wife, and Deepak managed to increase his income and he also makes regular savings in a credit cooperative.However, when the directors of Shiva Shikhar Cooperatives fled last year, he lost all his savings.The cooperative's collapse ruined Deepak, including many entrepreneurs. But Deepak's hard work continues.Now, Deepak has abandoned any plans of going abroad again. He has started saving in a commercial bank and plans to upgrade his business.He has also requested the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control to conduct lab tests on his bakery products. But, expired bakery items present a new challenge, he said.“If I miss removing expired products daily, the government’s inspection team could punish me. So I am more worried than the customers,” Deepak said. His bakery items are good for five days after production. “But breads from other factories have an expiry date of 10 days,” said Poudel. “As The Star Bakery's bread is fresher and has a shorter shelf life, the demand for it is higher.”XXXXXXXXPhoto caption:Deepak Gautam (left) and his wife Sanam in this combination photo. \n\nFifty-three trekking trails were developed in Baglung in the last fiscal year to draw foreigners and local tourists, considering rural tourism's contribution to rural community development.A trekking route has been built to Teuwa, where a statue of Gautam Buddha has been constructed in the Open Sculpture Museum of Galkot Municipality.An hour-long hiking trail to Teuwa from Harichaur has been the latest draw for youth.Similarly, another trekking route has been developed to connect Kot Ghar, which once served as the fortress of the hilly kingdom ruled by the Mallas. The renovated historical palace offers a reason to visit Galkot. Kot Ghar, once considered the seat of powerful Malla kings of Galkot, a pretty kingdom in the confederation of 24 states known as Chaubise Rajya, has been restored and preserved to draw tourists. The Kot Ghar means a house where weapons are placed or stored.Mahadev Sapkota, a tourism entrepreneur, said that the construction of trekking trails in Baur, Kothekhola rural municipality-7 to Gumba has been attracting locals to the two-day hiking trail. In the last fiscal year, local governments constructed 53 trails in the district, spending Rs1 million to Rs2 million in each project.“We have been observing an influx of youth for trekking after the development of trekking trains,” said Prem Lamichhane, chairman of ward 9 of Kothekhola Rural Municipality. Bishnu Nath Sharma, information officer of the Tourism and Industry Office of the Galkot Municipality, said that the trekking routes with homestays have been attracting domestic tourists in the area. The Tourism and Industry Office of the Gandaki province in Baglung funded Rs66 million to construct the trails.Locals said that many infrastructure projects are unfinished, but the construction of trekking routes has become successful and meets the objective of community development.“For hiking of a day or two, the trail has become easy and attractive,” said Saurab Khatri, a youth of ward 9 of Baglung Municipality. “There is a need to promote these destinations to bring tourists.” Khatri prefers to hike rather than use the vehicle. “The trail has grabbed the attention of many youths like us.” In the last fiscal year, 73 tourism infrastructure projects were completed through the Tourism and Industry Office. With the expenditure under Rs500,000 to Rs2 million, most of the projects were trail construction. There are concerns that small projects are delayed and unfinished. Paar Singh Thapa, chief of the Tourism and Industry Office, said the tourism infrastructure project achieves 95 percent of physical progress. The trail has been constructed to connect the religious sites. Besides trekking trails and homestays, meditation centres have been constructed in two Buddhist sites. Thapa said the projects will increase economic activities by alluring tourists and conserving religious places. The office has also invested in developing Durleni, in Baglung, as a tourism destination.The Baglung municipality has allocated Rs25 million to develop the area as a tourism destination. Similarly, the tourism office has invested Rs1.5 million to construct a martyr's memorial park at Argal in ward 2 of Tarakhola Rural Municipality. “Investing in similar work can be repetitive. In such a situation, the office needs to be responsible,” said Amar Thapa, chief of the District Coordination Committee. “We have directed the authorities to prevent the duplication and implement such projects that yield results. The office has made investments to identify many places. A master plan has been formulated to develop tourism sites. Bharat Sharma, mayor of Galkot Municipality, said they had demanded a budget of Rs20 million to develop major sites as per the master plan. However, in some areas, the budget has been frozen as the project did not move ahead. The budget allocated under Ghumte Tourism Development in the last fiscal year was frozen. Rs1.5 million has been invested to maintain Udaya Righa Buddha Bihar, located in Righa Ward No.11 in Galkot, along with the trail. Rs1 million has been allocated for the construction of a tourism trail from Gaighat waterfall of the Tara River to Baraha Lake. Similarly, Rs1 million has been invested to construct tourism infrastructure in Soledada at Tamankhola rural municipality, Rs1 million for the construction of Jaimini Dham Meditation Center, and Rs2 million for tourism infrastructure in Kuduledham. Thapa said that tourism arrivals will rise as infrastructure has been built and renovated in the coming days. Thapa said a temporary assistant engineer from the Tourism and Industry Office is doing all the technical work on the projects. The local government has been trying to preserve the historical artefacts to showcase to visitors. The ancient palace of Galkot was in dire straits because of the lack of conservation.The Shreemeher Battalion barracks of the Nepal Army and Galkot Municipality have jointly renovated the almost-collapsed Kot Ghar. \nAround 2.1 million children between six and 59 months across the country are being administered vitamin A supplements in the two-day nationwide campaign that started on Friday.Of them, 1.9 million children between 12 months to 59 months are also being administered with deworming tablets, according to the Nutrition Section of the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services.“The vitamin A and deworming campaign has been running smoothly all over the country today (Friday),” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the section. “We will request all parents of eligible children to ensure that their children are administered with vitamin A supplements and deworming tablets.”Around 52,000 female community health volunteers have been deployed nationwide for the campaign. The health ministry has been conducting it twice a year—in April and October—since 2003.Officials say that vitamin A supplementation and a deworming tablet administration campaigns are crucial in preventing many childhood diseases and reducing mortality among children under five.It is because of supplementation campaigns like these that night blindness among children, which used to be very high until two decades ago, has been almost eliminated, according to Thapa.Vitamin A deficiency is estimated to contribute to nearly one-fourth of global child mortality from measles, diarrhoea and malaria.The campaign is a success story in Nepal, as it has helped tackle the issue of vitamin A deficiency among children, which used to be a major public health problem in the country. Regular supplementation campaigns are estimated to have reduced deaths among children under five by 23 percent.Deworming tablets are crucial to preventing many childhood diseases and reducing the mortality rate among children under five, according to child health experts.The vitamin A supplementations and the deworming campaign had coverage rates of over 94 percent, the highest among all health campaigns run in the country in the past. However, the coverage declined to just over 80 percent in recent years.Child health experts say that vitamin A supplementation campaigns are important for children's overall growth and for protecting them from various infectious diseases.According to the World Health Organization, vitamin A deficiency causes visual impairment (night blindness) and vulnerability to illnesses like measles and diarrhoea among children. The supplement boosts immunity and ensures children’s natural growth. \nOf six seriously ill patients receiving intensive care at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital on Friday, five are infected with the dengue virus.The hospital’s emergency department, which treated 35 patients within 24 hours on Friday, said that 23 of them (or 66 percent) were dengue cases.“Of late, the number of dengue cases has grown alarmingly in Kathmandu Valley,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director of the hospital. “Seventy to 80 dengue patients seek care at our hospital daily.”What concerns doctors is that the number of severe dengue cases is rising along with the number of mild cases. According to Basaula, the number of patients with severe stomach pain, vomiting, and bleeding from nose, gums, and stool is increasing.“We transfuse platelets to the patients whose platelets count is too low,” said Basaula. “We advise those suffering from severe dengue not to wait at home for too long and to seek hospital care as soon as possible.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.At least nine deaths and over 20,000 infections have been reported from all 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms.The post-monsoon period is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the beginning of the year and across the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons.“Hundreds of people in the Kathmandu Valley might have been infected with dengue virus in recent days,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “As post-monsoon is the peak dengue season, neither the general public nor the authorities concerned have taken the issue seriously, and the rise in infection rate was obvious.”Doctors at Patan Hospital have also reported a surge in dengue infections in recent days.“On Thursday, 38 patients with high fever tested positive for dengue,” said Dr Ravi Shakya, director at the hospital. “Along with a surge in new infections, the number of complicated cases has also been rising.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population also said the number of dengue infections has surged in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur—as well as in Tanahun and Kaski, among other districts.“It is true that the number of complicated dengue cases have risen,” Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, the federal epidemic control body, concedes. “Even though dengue infections and complications have risen, case fatality has not.”To make matters worse, the surge in dengue cases has, of late, caused a critical shortage of blood in the Kathmandu Valley. The Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank) said that hospitals in the Valley have been facing a surge in demand for platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate due to the spike in dengue cases.“The daily demand for blood and blood components is about 400 pints, but we have only been able to collect about 20 to 30 pints,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, senior technical officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service. “We urge everyone eligible to come forward and donate blood. We have been struggling to meet the demand, and families of critically ill patients are in a difficult situation as they can’t find blood.”Officials attributed the decline in blood collection to the Dashain holidays. They say the closure of colleges for the Dashain holidays and the suspension of blood donation campaigns by many offices and organisations during the festival have led to a sharp drop in donations.In a bid to manage the acute blood crisis in the Valley, the blood bank on Thursday brought blood from Simara in Bara district.“We brought 112 pints of blood from Simara on Thursday to address the shortfall in Kathmandu,” said Yadav. “But we have not been able to meet the growing demands. We have been requesting all eligible people and organisations to donate, but that too is not yielding desired results. Relatives of patients have been facing a tough time managing the blood needed for their dear ones.”As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms including transfusion of platelet-rich plasma.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nWith the federal government slashing the budget of the nutrition programme, the distribution of fortified flour has been halted in all five districts of Karnali Province since the start of the ongoing fiscal year.Officials admit that the progress in improving nutrition in Karnali Province, achieved through years of efforts and investment, may have been jeopardised due to the suspension of the programme.“Thousands of pregnant women, new mothers, and young children have been deprived of fortified flour, which was crucial in reducing severe malnutrition among these,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The provincial government has started providing Rs2,500 to new mothers, but there is no support for improving the nutrition of young children.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. Stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to a report of the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.Likewise, wasting declined to eight percent from 10 percent in 2016. Wasting or low weight for a particular height is an undernutrition condition, which is a strong predictor of mortality among children under five, according to the World Health Organisation. Wasting in children is associated with a higher risk of death if not treated properly, according to it.Even though the survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. The problem is more prevalent in the Karnali Province. According to the report, over 30 percent of children under five in the province are stunted, the highest in the country, which is an indicator of chronic undernutrition. The province is also the poorest and most food insecure compared to the national average.According to officials, as part of a super flour distribution programme launched in 2014, the government used to provide three kg of flour—fortified with all necessary micronutrients—to pregnant women, new mothers, and children aged six to 24 months every month to address chronic malnutrition problems in the province. For that, the Health Ministry used to allocate Rs 50 million. “This year, around Rs100 million has been cut from the nutrition programme budget and this is the main reason for the stoppage of the fortified flour distribution programme ” said Thapa. “Besides halting the flour distribution, the budget cut will also impact awareness programmes, which are crucial for reducing the burden of problems.”Nutrition experts warn that slashing Karnali Province's nutrition budget will have long-term consequences and could jeopardise the decades of progress in the sector.They say that authorities concerned should have promoted locally available foods, made people aware of the importance of nutritious foods and provided fortified flour to improve nutrition conditions and lessen dependency on freely distributed foods.They say that health authorities must continue awareness programmes to educate people about the importance of healthy food and what they have been providing.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity.Experts say that nutrition has a direct link with the overall development of the country.They add that malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, ultimately affecting the country’s economic health.The Health Ministry had sought help from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address the growing problems of malnutrition in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces in the past.According to Thapa, the federal government has not renewed its contract with the World Food Programme, which provided logistic support for the fortified flour distribution programme.“This year, the government neither has renewed its agreement with the WFP (World Food Programme) nor allocated a budget for continuing the fortified flour distribution programme,” said Thapa.  \nSave the Children Nepal has launched a pilot initiative of introducing ‘rainbow kits’ specifically designed for transgender individuals impacted by disasters.The initiative aims to ensure that transgender people have dignified access to essential hygiene materials during times of humanitarian crisis.The rainbow kits break traditional gender binary norms by addressing the specific needs of the transgender community during humanitarian disasters, such as the recent flood and landslides in Nepal.“The rainbow kits are a response to the limitations of conventional humanitarian dignity and hygiene kits, which often fail to meet the needs of the LGBTQI+ population,” said Tara Chettry, country director for Save the Children in Nepal and Bhutan. “As diversity and inclusivity remain at the heart of Save the Children’s organisational values, I believe this initiative broadens our approach to humanitarian response, encouraging us to view aid through a more targeted and inclusive lens rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.”The kits were officially handed over to the Blue Diamond Society (BDS), a pioneering organisation working for the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals in Nepal. The BDS will distribute these essential kits to those affected by recent floods and landslides, ensuring that the specific hygiene needs of the LGBTQI+ community are met.The rainbow kit includes a carefully curated selection of items designed by Save the Children and the BDS to support health, dignity, and comfort, including condoms and lubricants, sanitary pads/menstrual cups/tampons, wipes, dry tissues, V-wash, panty liners, hot water bags, menstrual panty (free size), towel, hand sanitiser, toothpaste and brush, soap, masks, and other essential items.Tailored kits promote inclusivity and ensure that all identities are recognised and respected, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics, said Manisha Dhakal, executive director of Blue Diamond Society. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal defeated the United States in the Super Over in their second match of the three-match T2oI series at Dallas, US on Sunday.The Rhinos chased the three-run target by the US in the one-over eliminator. With the win, Nepal have clinched the series with a match to spare.The match was pushed to the Super Over following a tie. After winning the toss and opting to bat first, Nepal posted a competitive total of 170-6.Kushal Bhurtel was the star of the innings, anchoring Nepal with an impressive unbeaten 92 from 54 deliveries. His innings featured seven boundaries and six maximums, ensuring Nepal set a challenging target. Anil Sah provided a steady start with 25, while quick cameos from Gulsan Jha (19) and Rohit Paudel (18) bolstered Nepal’s total.In response, the USA also reached 170-8 after 20 overs, leading to a rare and dramatic tie. Andries Gous led the chase for the home side, scoring 62 off 43 balls, while Saiteja Mukkamalla supported with 47 runs from 41 deliveries. However, crucial wickets at regular intervals slowed their momentum. Nepal’s Karan KC was pivotal in the bowling attack, claiming three wickets for 35 runs, while Sompal Kami took two wickets, including key scalps like Aaron Jones and Gous.Dipendra Singh Airee put up an all-round display as Nepal defeated the United States by 17 runs in the first T20I at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Friday.The final match of the series will be played on Monday. \nNepal were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Bhutan in their opening match of the Group B at the SAFF Women’s Championship 2024 at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Friday.This is the first time Nepal have gone winless against a Bhutanese side in SAFF women’s history.Nepal had found success each time in their previous four SAFF meetings, scoring a total of 23 goals and conceding none. In the 2022 edition, Nepal had thumped Bhutan 4-0.It is also the first time Nepal have failed to score against Bhutan in the SAFF Women’s Championship.For Bhutan, it was their historic draw against Nepal in their women’s football history.Nepal, who are bidding to win their maiden SAFF crown after falling agonisingly short in previous five finals, were clear favourites and put Bhutan under pressure throughout the game but could not pierce a solid Bhutanese defence.Sabitra Bhandari, who is in France with En Avant Guingamp, missed the match after her club refused to release her before the FIFA Women’s International window which begins on Monday. Bhandari alone had 10 goals against Bhutan.Her presence was sorely missed as Nepal found several chances in the first half but could not capitalise on them.Saru Limbu had a golden opportunity to give Nepal the lead from open chance in the 26th minute after Preeti Rai set her up with a clever through ball but Limbu flashed wide.Nepal also found a series of chances inside the opposition box in the 40th but the Bhutanese defence line was so stubborn to foil every Nepali attacking effort.Nepal coach Rajendra Tamang threw in Rekha Paudel and Dipa Shahi in place of Limbu and Renuka Nagarkoti in the second half to give Nepal more attacking dynamics.Paudel’s presence was immediately felt as she troubled Bhutan defence line and goalkeeper Sangita Monger with her smooth display. Paudel, who plays for Abu Dhabi Country Club, reached close to scoring quickly after the restart when she ran into a cross from Sabita Rana Magar inside the six-yard box.Paudel also threatened the Bhutan box in the 52nd minute with her incredible first-time shot off a corner but Bhutan captain and goalkeeper Monger denied Paudel’s effort with a brilliant save.Paudel also had a clean chance in the 59th minute when Dipa Shahi fed her just outside the six-yard box but the forward shot directly at the goalkeeper.However, Limbu’s substitution and substitution of Dipa Shahi after 71 minutes due to an injury left Nepali midfield clueless.Coach Tamang also brought in Anita Basnet and Anita KC in search of goals but Nepal could not break a disciplined Bhutan defence.Rana Magar had a last ditch effort in stoppage time but her long-range shot hit the post.Earlier, Sri Lanka defeated the Maldives 1-0 to collect three points, thanks to a 17th minute header from WMK Imesha.Nepal next play the Maldives on Monday. \nDipendra Singh Airee put up an all-round display as Nepal defeated the United States by 17 runs in the first T20I at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Friday.Invited to bat first after losing the toss, Nepal posted 164-9 from their 20 overs after openers Anil Sah and Aasif Sheikh, captain Rohit Paudel and Airee all shone with the bat.Sah and Sheikh added 48 runs for the opening wicket before skipper Paudel exploited a fine start to the innings by smashing 49 runs off 33 balls. He also shared a crucial 66-run stand with Airee, who made 28 runs off 17 balls, for the fifth wicket.Harmeet Singh, Saurabh Netravalkar and Jasdeep Singh picked two wickets each for the hosts.In reply, Karan KC and Rijan Dhakal struck early to dismiss both US openers Saiteja Mukkamalla (2) and captain Monank Patel (3). Andries Gous scored 30 off 25 balls and tried to rebuild the innings but the hosts found themselves in deep trouble at 56-4 half-way into the game when Gulsan Jha had Gous caught by Sah in the 10.1 overs.Airee then dispatched Milind Kumar for 22 to halt US progress.Shayen Jahangir resisted Nepali bowling attack and lifted the chase with a half-century but Airee hit back removing Harmeet Singh for a duck and Jasdeep Singh for 16 to restrict the hosts to 147-7.Jahangir was unconquered on 60 off 34 balls.Nepal lead the three-match T20I series 1-0.The two sides play the second T20I on Sunday. \nFive-time champions India launched their SAFF Women’s Championship campaign with a 5-2 victory over Pakistan at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Thursday.Grace Dangmei scored a brace for India, while Manisha Kalyan, Bala Devi Ngangom and Jyoti Chouhan were also on target.Suha Hirani and Kayla Siddiqi scored for Pakistan.India, who are looking to reclaim the SAFF throne after losing it to Bangladesh in 2022, made their intent clear with a powerful display.India took the lead in the 5th minute through Dangmei, who received a low cross from Ranjana Chanu at the edge of the area and rocketed a powerful shot into the back of the net.Kalyan doubled India’s lead in the 17th minute with a superb finish after running into a through pass from Bala Devi.Bala Devi then added India’s third in the 35th minute, smashing an indirect freekick into the top corner.Grace added her individual second seven minutes later with a tight-angled half-volley after Pakistan’s backline failed to clear a cross from Chanu.Pakistan went into the break reducing the deficit to 4-1 from a penalty kick, which was awarded to them after Ashalata Devi brought down Nadia Khan inside the box in the first half injury time. Hirani stepped up and gave India goalkeeper Elangbam Panthoi no chance.The Pakistani were a completely different side after the break and reduced India’s advantage quickly after the restart when Siddiqi found Rameen Fareed’s deflected attempt just outside the six yard box and sent it into the bottom corner.The second goal instilled a sense of an improbable fightback into Pakistan and went close to scoring twice after the hour mark, with Zahmena Malik finding an open chance from close range in the 60th and Amina reaching close to scoring from open play four minutes later. But Pakistan lacked clinical touch and missed both opportunities.Chouhan then punished Pakistan adding their winning goal in the 78th heading in a corner from Dalima Chhibber.India play Bangladesh in their next Group A game on Wednesday.

A 14-year long painful wait for a maiden SAFF trophy. Will Nepal be able to break the title jinx this time?“Our goal is the SAFF championship title,” Nepal captain Anjila Tumbapo Subba said on the eve of the tournament. “Our team is fit and balanced…we are ready.”Nepal begin their bid for a maiden SAFF Women’s Championship title and their first ever major international trophy against Bhutan on Friday.Nepal have played 11 finals in the last two and half decades and have won none.Nepal have been drawn alongside Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka in Group B. They take on the Maldives in their next group match on Monday before wrapping up the group stage by facing Sri Lanka on Thursday.Coach Rajendra Tamang’s side will be backed by home support once again—like the last two editions (2019 and 2022)—and will enter the competition as favourites.But the task will not be easy.Until 2019, India were the sole dominant force in South Asian women’s football, having won all the first five editions.However, their supremacy in the region came to a brutal end in 2022 when Bangladesh won the title for the first time. India were also beaten 3-0 by Bangladesh in the group stage.Nepal were the finalists and were largely tipped to win the championship after knocking out India in the semi-finals but their woes continued when they lost the final 3-1 to Bangladesh.On paper, these three sides (Nepal, India and Bangladesh) will be the top contenders again.India will look to reclaim the throne they lost two years ago, while Bangladesh will aim to assert themselves as the new powerhouse by winning a second straight title. For Nepal, the opportunity to win a first title is back at home again but they will first need to overcome the challenges of superpowers India and defending champions Bangladesh.“We have played a lot of finals but have not won any. It’s time for the players to step up and motivate themselves to break the jinx,” said coach Tamang, adding that they had been training with complete focus on the trophy despite a short preparation period.“We only had two weeks of training because of the ANFA Women’s League. It would have helped a lot if we were given the opportunity to play a number of international friendlies prior to the tournament.”“But, despite the setbacks, we have prepared well,” added Tamang.Nepal’s star forward Sabitra Bhandari is set to miss at least one match due to her engagement with French Club En Avant Guingamp. \nExpressing gratitude to the people who have congratulated her on her Nobel Prize, Han Kang, this year’s Nobel laureate in literature, spoke publicly for the first time in Korea Thursday at the 18th Pony Chung Innovation Award ceremony held at the Pony Chung Hall in Seoul.“The past week will be remembered as a deeply moving experience,” Han said, adding, “As always, I hope to continue meeting readers through my books.”Han was named the recipient of the Pony Chung Innovation Award before the Nobel announcement, in recognition of her profound exploration of the human psyche and evocative emotional expressions that have resonated with readers worldwide. She is the first Korean author to win both the British International Booker Prize, in 2016 for “Vegetarian,” and France’s Prix Medicis, in 2023 for “We Do Not Part.”Apart from a brief interview with the Swedish public broadcaster SVT and a short statement issued via her Korean publishers on Oct. 11, Han has largely avoided the media.HDC Group chairman and Pony Chung Foundation founder Chung Mong-gyu, as well as Park Young-ja, wife of the late Chung Se-yung, the second chairman of HDC Group, were among those attending the award ceremony.Reflecting on her Nobel win, Han said, “When I first received the call from the Nobel Committee, it didn’t feel real. I simply tried to remain calm. It wasn’t until I saw the news reports that the gravity of the moment sank in.”Han said she celebrated the evening privately.“The past week, with so many people celebrating as if it were their own achievement, will remain a particularly special memory for me,” she said.Han also extended thanks to those who have expressed concerns about quietude in her personal life after the Nobel prize.“I hope my life doesn’t change too drastically. I have always connected with the world through my writing, and I want to continue meeting readers in that way.”Han said that she is currently working on a novella she started earlier this year. While she hopes to publish it in the first half of next year, she admitted it’s hard to predict when she will finish.Looking back on her 30-year career, Han reflected on the simplicity of her daily life: “I don’t drink, and recently, I’ve even given up coffee for health reasons. I rarely travel. Sometimes, people ask me what I do for fun.”She said she enjoys walking, reading books she hasn’t yet gotten to and spending time with her family and close friends.“What I love the most is the time I spend turning over ideas for my next novel that I have in mind,” said Han. “I often lose my way while writing a novel, surprised by the unexpected turns. But the satisfaction of reaching the end after a long detour is immense.”Han, who will turn 54 next month, remarked on the conventional wisdom that an author’s golden years are between 50 and 60.“If that’s true, I have six years left,” she said.“Though some authors remain active into their 70s or 80s, it takes a good deal of luck. For now, I want to focus on completing the three books I have in mind, with patience and perseverance, while balancing the rest of my life.”Han thanked her readers, the literary community and those who have supported the publishing industry through difficult times.The Pony Chung Foundation, established in 2005 in memory of the late Chung Se-yung, former honorary chairman of HDC Group, supports a wide range of initiatives in the humanities.Past recipients include director Hwang Dong-hyuk of “Squid Game,” pianist Cho Seong-jin and former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The award carries a cash prize of 200 million won ($146,000).-In association with Asia News Network \nGunmen killed a Mozambique opposition lawyer and a party official after firing multiple rounds at a car in which they were travelling on Saturday, rights groups said, ratcheting up tensions ahead of protests against a disputed election result.New opposition party Podemos and its presidential aspirant Venancio Mondlane reject provisional results showing a likely win for Frelimo - the party that has ruled Mozambique for half a century - and its candidate Daniel Chapo.They have called for a nationwide strike on Monday.Mozambican civil society election observer group More Integrity said the attack happened in the Bairro Da Coop neighbourhood of the capital Maputo, killing Podemos lawyer Elvino Dias and party representative Paulo Guambe.Human Rights Watch and Mozambique’s Center for Democracy and Human Rights (CDD) also issued statements confirming the attack.“They were brutally assassinated (in a) cold-blooded murder,” Adriano Nuvunga, CDD director, told Reuters by telephone.“The indications that around 10 to 15 bullets were shot, and they died instantly,” he added, describing it as a “message” to opposition protesters planning to convene on Monday.The European Union and Mozambique’s former colonial ruler Portugal condemned the killing and called for an investigation.Later, in the evening, Frelimo’s candidate Chapo condemned the attack as an “affront to the principles of ...democracy that we must all defend”.Mondlane’s rise to become Mozambique’s main challenger was a threat to Frelimo, but also to the former official opposition party Renamo - once a rebel outfit backed by racist white regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) during the Cold War.Alex Vines, Africa programme director at London-based international affairs think tank Chatham House, called the killing a “serious escalation” that raised tensions ahead of Monday’s strike.Western observers have cast doubt on the credibility of the poll, noting reports of vote buying, intimidation, inflated voter rolls and poor transparency in collation - problems that have marred most polls since Frelimo introduced democracy in 1994 after two decades in power.Full results are expected on October 24, but many fear Monday’s protest could turn bloody. Mozambique’s security forces have opened fire on protesters, including after last year’s local elections, rights groups say. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nNepal's ancient practice of worshipping young girls as Kumaris has evolved, with Matina Shakya's reign (2008-2017) marking significant changes in education, healthcare, and social integration for both current and former Kumaris.\nJuddha Shumsher Rana's zoo in 1932 housed various animals, including tigers, rhinoceroses, hippos, red pandas, peacocks, pheasants, Himalayan monals, monkeys, bears, deer, and even a lion.\nUnauthorized translations, including Taslima Nasrin's Nepali books, thrive in Nepal due to the absence of proper regulations, underpaying copyright holders, and hurting the industry and readers with poor quality translations.\nThe United Nations has faced chronic failures in preventing conflicts, with its Security Council's structure and veto power hindering its ability to maintain international peace, and resolutions often ignored, undermining the organization's effectiveness and relevance, despite its shortcomings being a reflection of structural deficiencies rather than irrelevance.\nEdited volumes in social sciences (articles or previously published) advance knowledge by providing thematic coherence, introductions, and inter-article references, while readers compile pre-existing articles on specific topics, and both are crucial for academic scholarship and research.\nIn Nepal's Karnali Province, apple farmers face transportation challenges despite increased production, leading to losses and income disparity due to poor roads, lack of storage facilities, and exploitative middlemen.\nThe episode of Bhatbhateni supermarket chain owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land and announcing plans to build the head office of the ruling CPN-UML is dubious on multiple fronts. More than anything else, it has again exposed how Nepal’s politicians, political parties and businesspeople work in collusion for mutual benefit. There is nothing inherently wrong with politicians and businesspersons cooperating, for instance to create a business- and investment-friendly climate. But any initiative the government or the country’s major political parties take should be in the interest of the society, and not unduly favour any particular group or person. But what we see is that most collaborations between politicians and businessmen in Nepal invariably benefit vested interests. The deal between CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner has raised various questions. First, the way the party central secretariat took the decision looks suspicious. Though Oli convened a meeting to get the proposal endorsed by the party committee, even the party’s office bearers were reportedly kept in dark about the details and exact plans. Oli is not only the chief of a major political force but also the country’s prime minister. Even a layman can easily infer that Gurung, the businessman, didn’t make such a huge investment out of generosity. Another concerning thing about the Oli-Gurung deal is that the prime minister openly accepted the huge donation—10 ropani and 14 ana (0.55 hectares) of land and an investment to build a highly sophisticated building—from a person who is facing multiple corruption charges and whose cases are sub judice in the court. This is tantamount to openly promoting corruption and bad governance. Oli’s action has been criticised even in the UML party. Some leaders including standing committee member Binda Pandey have publicly criticised the deal and have demanded that the party correct it. They have admirably mustered courage to speak against the wrong of Oli, the party’s all-powerful chair, even when they know that he tends to take such criticism personally. If the past is any guide, such critics of Oli tend to be systematically sidelined in the party. This is not a one-off act by the chief of a major political party. It is an open secret that major parties give election tickets to businesspersons in return for financial help of various kinds. There is one thing common between Sher Bahadur Deuba of Nepali Congress, UML’s Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre): all of them have over the years sought the help of controversial businessmen to prop up their parties or even their own factions within the parties. Oli is yet to offer a convincing reason for why accepting the donation was right. The occupant of the highest office in the land cannot act with such abandon, with seemingly no sense of accountability towards the people, or even towards his own party cadres. Oli has always been known as someone who is headstrong and not afraid even to shield goons if it serves his interest. He hasn’t changed much. Meanwhile, the public’s delusion with the old political establishment continues to grow.     \nDespite progress in reducing maternal mortality rates in Nepal, the rate has plateaued, with many women still dying during childbirth due to a lack of skilled birth attendants, inadequate infrastructure, and a failure to empower marginalized communities.\nNepalis with disabilities face the daily ordeal of navigating cities that are not built for them. Whenever roads and sidewalks are built or expanded, the disabled community harbours hope of easier mobility. However, the authorities either overlook the accessibility for such people or carelessly build structures that are supposed to assist them. This renders people not only disabled by their conditions but also by infrastructural shortcomings. According to the National Census 2021, 2.2 percent of Nepal’s population has some form of disability; 2.5 percent of males and 2 percent of females have a disability. The country ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in December 2009. Moreover, the provisions in the Disability Rights Act ensure accessibility to physical infrastructure. Although Nepal has a progressive policy on the rights of people with disabilities, the implementation part has been lagging. An audit published by the National Federation of the Disabled-Nepal on 150 public infrastructure sites in Kathmandu showed that no samples were completely accessible: 132 samples were found “not accessible”, while the rest were “partially accessible”. In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs 50 million for disabled-friendly pavements and even completed the first phase, a 1.5km stretch from Putalisadak to Thapathali. Although this is commendable, these supposedly disabled-friendly pavements need routine monitoring, as most of the tactile pavings built earlier ended abruptly or led to electricity poles, trees, walls or drains. Generalising disabilities and offering solutions that only cater to a specific group is also problematic. Most of the time, the authorities build tactile paving and label the area disability-friendly. However, problems of people with other forms of physical and intellectual disability—such as lack of tactile or audio indicators at zebra crossings, narrow sidewalks and absence of ramps—remain unaddressed.Although road accidents occasionally make headlines, accidents involving people with disabilities rarely get noticed. Many unreported cases involve people with disabilities falling into rivers or drains, collisions with poles or trees due to ineffective tactile blocks, and hit-and-run cases while crossing roads. These accidents can be avoided if basic assistance like railings, ramps, audio and tactile indicators, etc are ensured. In many instances, these problems arise not from the lack of disability-friendly infrastructures but from the general mismanagement and poor condition of public infrastructures. Potholes are a common sight on older roads and even some newer ones in Kathmandu. With the city’s rapid urbanisation, construction is happening every few metres. Building materials are often placed on sidewalks that are already narrow, leaving pedestrians with no choice but to walk on the roads. This poses a risk for everyone and could be perilous for people with disabilities. Moreover, the roads that seem perfectly fine the previous day are under maintenance the next day. The authorities do not consider providing an alternative disability-friendly route. Even the signs that inform of the situation of the roads ahead are ineffective. Doing the bare minimum to check the inclusivity list is not an option. Many government office buildings in Nepal are not disability-friendly, and the same applies to institutions like schools and universities. This is also due to the lack of proper budget, as disabled-friendly infrastructures are often not prioritised, depriving a significant and capable portion of the population of their fundamental rights. The government must ensure that people with disabilities have the rights that are promised in the constitution. As for our part as citizens, we must abandon our primitive mindset and be more inclusive of people with disabilities in our thoughts and actions. It’s time we realise that an inclusive nation leaves no one behind as it progresses.  \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nOn Sunday, the country is likely to experience partly to generally cloudy weather in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces, including the hilly regions of the other provinces.In contrast, the remaining parts of the country are expected to see partly cloudy to mainly fair conditions.The Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, in a few places across Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces, as well as in the hilly areas of the rest of the country.The weather pattern is expected to continue into tonight, with similar conditions forecast.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nTwo months after the amendment of the transitional justice law, the committee tasked with nominating candidates for two truth and reconciliation commissions commences its work, aiming to select ten office bearers within two months.\nRabi Lamichhane, head of RSP, was detained for six days over embezzlement charges against Suryadarshan Cooperative, sparking protests both for and against his detention, and a prohibited order was issued in Pokhara due to unrest.\nA pregnant woman hospitalized with dengue showcases a concerning surge in infections among this vulnerable population, raising maternal and newborn health risks and potentially hampering progress towards reducing Nepal's maternal mortality rate.\nFormer home minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha discusses the performance of Nepal's government, highlighting concerns over corruption, disaster relief shortcomings, and the arrest of Rabi Lamichhane, while also emphasizing the need for a united opposition to challenge the government's alleged wrongdoings, including the possible amendment of the Political Parties Act.\nFloods damaged tomato farms in Nepal, leading to a fourfold increase in prices due to short supply, with further price hikes expected due to upcoming festivals and delayed arrival of new production.\nRabi Lamichhane, former deputy PM and RSP chief, was arrested for misappropriating cooperative funds; investigations into similar allegations against Congress and UML leaders are demanded for credibility.\nThe present-day China seems interested in reaching out to as many countries as possible because it aspires to be recognised and felt as a global power. Its endeavour to rediscover South Asian culture and heritage as part of its extending connectivity mission is quite natural. Indeed, President Xi Jinping’s China has tried to hone both hard and soft power capabilities by adopting a dualistic approach to upgrading its foreign policy objectives. Since China’s soft power competitive smartness is comparatively weaker than that of the Western powers, especially its fierce competitor, the United States of America, it seems to develop a level of connectivity in multiple areas—culture, history, infrastructure building and even political influence. Thus, this article captures such aspects that not only try to revisit the old links but also to rekindle the hope of bringing South Asians closer to the people of China. Language, civilisational commonalities and trade prospects are essential for promoting such cultural and other connectivity linkages.China is a “civilisation state” with a strong imperial political tradition. The present view of the nation-state, which is very much tempered by its cultural heritage, took its form only in the 19th century. Confucian and Lao Tzu’s thoughts, believed to have maintained harmony and peace within the broad Chinese society, still prevail. “Confucian world”, to quote Martin Jacques, “is a world without border” urging the Chinese people to “reconstruct Confucian orthodoxy and Confucian view of the world that all Under-Heavan is one family”. In the past, all imperial dynasties in China upheld the idea of “Under-Heavan”, which has, as of today, given rise to maintaining harmony among the various nations (Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan and Han). The Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities of Xinjiang Province sometimes show their separate identity, but China is more or less a homogenous country despite more than 92 percent domination of Han people. As a result of such a long cultural heritage, the process of political acculturation is accordingly shaped, given the one-party rule seldom brings forth discordant views of people. The increasing acceptability of Buddhism in China has also made the connectivity agenda easier, as it is said that about 25 percent of Chinese embrace Buddhism. Taking it as a significant area for expanding Chinese soft power, the Communist regime has made it a component of Chinese foreign policy, contrary to the communist formulation of religion as the opium of people. South Asia, by contrast, is hierarchical due to its dominant caste stratification system, which has prevailed for over four thousand years. The dominant Hindu religion, accompanied by caste hierarchy, continues. However, Buddhism, which does not accept many Hindu rituals and customs features, is the most important connecting factor. Today, the doctrine of peaceful co-existence, peace as a component of foreign policies of all, has further reinforced this connectivity. The Trans Himalayan cultural, political and economic links were established between the Nepal valley and China. The Jokhang temple was constructed 1,400 years ago by the artists of Kathmandu Valley. During the Lichhavi period in the Valley, Bhrikuti, the princess, was married to the King of Tibet. Similarly, Araniko is regarded as the best connecting factor between Nepal and China. In addition, many explorers actively discovered various cultural and religious places in India and Nepal. India, a major part of South Asia, was connected first in 67 AD by an Indian scholar, Kashayapa Matanga. Jawaharlal Nehru writes in The Discovery of India that “there was two-way traffic between India and China and many Chinese scholars came here”. Among them, Fa Hien, Sung Yun and Hsuan Tsang were prominent. Many Chinese scholars spent years at Nalanda University learning Buddhism.Such rich cultural links between South Asian countries and China were almost broken following the emergence of nation-states and the politicisation of borders, trade, tourism and pilgrimages. Although avenues of contact have been made easy, the “primacy of politics” has forestalled cooperation and peace. At a time when greater connectivity between the peoples of China and South Asia needs to be promoted, competitive power politics have created political barriers. A cultural forum held in Malaysia in September 2024 has emphasised the need for cooperation and understanding to establish civilisational links. It is stated that “Asian countries should make full use of the power of culture and civilization to support regional unity, openness and progress for a shared future”. Given the divergent political approaches to foreign and strategic policies of South Asian nations and the increasing impetus given to ultra-nationalism trends based on political bigotries, it would be difficult for China to navigate its overall relations with South Asia as a region. Since the very concept and practice of regionalism seems to be declining due to rivalries of big powers in the region, China's aspiration of upgrading cultural connectivity is likely to suffer a setback. Unless India, China and Pakistan achieve a certain level of political understanding, the prospects of cooperation, stability, unity and partnership will not be bright. Yet, amid conflict and cooperation, some of the mechanisms can be put in place for upgrading the level of connectivity. Culturally, South Asian people were/are exposed more to the West than to oriental culture because of colonialism. Western education and language promoted under the patronage of British colonial power could influence South Asian culture by mixing Western and Eastern cultures. Language, education, lifestyle, etc., have been tremendously shaped by the West. Moreover, Western political ideology was formed to such a great degree that the new elites of South Asia were/are more anglicised than the Westerners themselves. Historically, South Asia is an amalgam of different cultural traits, making a mixture of them all. To cite Nehru again, “A synthesis worked itself out: new styles of architecture arose, food and clothing changed, and life was affected and varied in many others”. Islam enriched the culture much earlier than the coming of the Muslim rulers in India. Such rich synthesis that exists even today can be useful for connecting it to the Chinese cultural tradition formed in the same manner as in South Asia.  \nNepal's community forestry (CF) initiative, once celebrated globally as a model for sustainable forest management, is now at a critical turning point. Launched in the early 1990s, CF aimed to conserve forests and improve local livelihoods. For many rural families, forests provided fuel, fodder and timber. Over the past 30 years, CF has evolved from small-scale, subsistence-focused practices into more diverse management approaches, reflecting changing local needs and broader policy agendas. Yet, increasing dissatisfaction among local politicians, forestry authorities and community members has emerged due to the programme's declining effectiveness. While CF was successful in the past, its impact on livelihoods has not reached its full potential, and once-active forest user groups have become passive with the changes in socioeconomic conditions.This does not mean the community-based approach is outdated. Core principles, such as devolving forest rights and community-based forest management, remain relevant. However, the current challenge is whether CF can adapt to become more market-oriented and climate-resilient while maintaining equity and sustainability. Urgent reforms are needed, as CF in Nepal faces significant obstacles due to major changes in rural dynamics. Without timely recognition of these issues and appropriate interventions, CF risks failure. Rather than focusing solely on subsistence, CF must tap into its economic potential in two key areas.Sustainable forest resource harvestCF can realise its economic potential through sustainable timber and forest resource harvesting. Over the past decade, Nepal’s involvement in global climate agreements, such as the UNFCCC, has increased the importance of forest management in national climate mitigation strategies. Despite this, the declining contribution of forests to household economies has weakened community members’ incentives to invest in forest management. Sustainable timber harvesting could generate much-needed revenue to reinvest in community and forest development projects.However, several challenges have slowed progress in sustainable timber harvesting. The government introduced scientific forest management to generate revenue through sustainable practices by boosting timber production and employment. Yet, this initiative was criticised for forest exploitation, governance concerns and a \"one-size-fits-all\" strategy that ignored local conditions. Eventually, stakeholder opposition and a lack of scientific evidence led to its failure.A more effective strategy would be categorising community forests based on specific objectives. For example, forests in the productive Terai region could focus on timber production, while those in more inaccessible hill and mountain regions could prioritise conservation, ecotourism, non-timber forest products, high-value medicinal herbs and even Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation ( REDD+) initiatives. The CF has successfully restored degraded forests but has struggled with governance and institutional capacity. The dissolution of scientific forest management guidelines further complicates matters, as the absence of national standards has hindered tree harvesting. Additionally, the high costs of harvesting in challenging terrain, combined with poor forest management practices such as improper tending, frequent forest fires, insect infestations and old tree retention, have degraded the quality of local timber, making it difficult to compete with imports like Malaysian wood.To address these challenges, Nepal’s forest management must blend art and science to maximise economic benefits. Managing forests as enterprises, establishing wood treatment centres to enhance timber durability, setting up softwood processing units and creating small-scale plywood and veneer mills are essential steps toward revitalising community forestry and making it economically viable.REDD+ and carbon creditsWhen protection-oriented policies limit revenue generation from forest products, alternative funding mechanisms like payments for ecosystem services through REDD+ should be explored. REDD+ compensates countries for verified emission reductions, typically through carbon credits. Nepal has made notable progress with the development of the National REDD+ Strategy, the Benefit Sharing Plan and the establishment of the REDD Implementation Centre. However, these efforts alone are not enough to position Nepal as a reliable supplier of carbon credits in the global market. To remain competitive, Nepal must address both internal and external factors limiting its ability to fully benefit from these markets.Internally, Nepal faces challenges such as unstable leadership within institutions managing REDD+ and a lack of adaptability in governance. Consistent leadership is crucial for continuity, efficient decision-making, resource allocation, and effective utilisation of REDD+ revenue. Equally important for Nepal is transitioning from grants to developing strategies that attract private-sector investment. With the voluntary carbon market projected to grow from $2 billion to $50 billion by 2030, the country must set long-term goals to ensure its forest-dependent communities can tap into this form of growth led by the private sector.Externally, Nepal’s unique circumstances make it difficult to generate substantial carbon credits. The country does not qualify as a High Forest, Low Deforestation (HFLD) country and lacks the high deforestation rates needed to produce significant emission reduction credits under REDD+. Global carbon markets tend to favour tropical countries like Brazil and Indonesia, with higher deforestation rates.Three primary standards govern jurisdictional-level carbon credits: ART’s TREES, Verra’s VCS JNR and the FCPF Carbon Fund. With the FCPF Carbon Fund ending in 2025 and Verra’s VCS JNR focusing solely on emission reductions, ART’s TREES will be the only standard permitting removal credits at the jurisdictional level. Nepal is part of the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance (LEAF) coalition, which follows the REDD+ Environmental Excellence Standard TREES standard. Under this standard, countries can generate removal credits only if their emissions during the crediting period are lower than the average emissions from deforestation and degradation over the previous five years.Although Nepal has made significant progress in forest restoration, it may face challenges in claiming removal credits. Since emissions from deforestation and degradation are already low, even a small change in forest activity could cause emissions to exceed the historical baseline, resulting in the loss of removal credits. This situation might unintentionally penalise Nepal for its forest conservation efforts and make it harder to benefit from the global REDD+ programme.Nepal must reform its policies, restructure community-level governance, practice active forest management, build capacity, strengthen leadership and adopt a forward-looking approach that embraces its forests’ economic and environmental potential. By doing so, the country can ensure that its forests continue providing economic and environmental benefits while maintaining core principles of sustainability and equity. Without these reforms, Nepal risks missing out on the significant benefits that community forestry can offer in the years ahead. \nIs Nepal on the verge of becoming another Sri Lanka? Questions of these motifs were common in Nepal’s public debate sphere after Sri Lanka defaulted on its sovereign debt in April 2022. Around the same period, another South Asian nation—Pakistan—had difficulty servicing its foreign debt. While the doomsday predictions of Nepal becoming another Sri Lanka turned out far-fetched, can the debt distress experienced by Sri Lanka and Pakistan offer lessons for Nepal’s public finances? A closer investigation of public debt in three countries—Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka—offers some answers. First, these three South Asian nations differ markedly in their public debt levels and other public finance characteristics. While assessed as having a low risk of debt distress, Nepal has witnessed a surge in its public debt holding, from about 25 percent of GDP in the fiscal year 2014-15 to 42.7 percent in 2023-24. However, despite the peculiarities of every nation, some common patterns let us draw a few lessons.Fiscal profligacy to serve short-term political gains is at the heart of the public debt woes. For instance, Sri Lanka aggressively used foreign loans obtained at a high cost to finance development projects and social welfare to fulfil election pledges and appease the voters. Even when the debt accumulation was spiralling out of control, the government failed to make timely adjustments and instead opted for counter-intuitive tax cuts in 2019. Covid-19 halted Pakistan’s tourism, a critical foreign reserve source. Moreover, policies such as a ban on imports of chemical fertilisers caused a decline in agricultural production and exports, hastening the debt crisis. However, the crucial factor was a long history of fiscal indiscipline, resulting in chronic budget deficits. Likewise, Pakistan also opted for persistent budget deficits to finance development projects, often without adequate preparation and evaluation, and other politically convenient measures, such as untargeted energy subsidies and significant fiscal support to large but inefficient state-owned enterprises. The rapid accumulation of public debt in Nepal is partly due to fiscal profligacy—running persistent budget deficits to finance government expenditures, including wasteful recurrent expenditures and investments in development projects that have not undergone adequate preparations. Similarly, untargeted social security expenditures motivated by electoral considerations rather than sound assessments are rampant in the country.Another important lesson is that the external finance landscape changes as the country climbs the income ladder. There is a gradual increase in the cost of external borrowing as the sources of concessional financing dry up or are inadequate to fuel higher development aspirations. For instance, when Sri Lanka upgraded to a middle-income country and entered the international capital market in 2007, its share of non-concessional loans was less than 20 percent. However, as its income increased, so did its borrowings from high-interest foreign sources, also called international sovereign bonds. The share of non-concessional loans increased to more than 50 percent of its total loans. Pakistan has also seen a declining share of multilateral creditors in its external loan portfolio and an increasing concentration of bilateral creditors (primarily Chinese loans) and commercial creditors. Until now, Nepal has relied exclusively on concessional loans for external finance. It would be wise to tread a cautious path, as the country has recently graduated to a lower-middle-income category in the World Bank’s classification and is poised to graduate from the least-developed country category in 2026.A closer investigation into the public debt of these nations also indicates that the Chinese debt-trap narrative—observations that China burdens developing countries with unsustainable debt—is perhaps overblown. The experience of Pakistan and Sri Lanka suggests that loans from China did add to the debt burden—as the interest rates are higher than that of concessional loans obtained from multilateral sources—evidence suggests that Chinese loans were obtained at interest rates lower than that of international capital markets. In Sri Lanka’s case, Chinese loans constituted a lower share of the external debt and debt servicing than what was owed to other sources, such as international capital markets. The biggest issue with loans from China seems to be non-transparency rather than its volumes and servicing costs. Debt crises can occur at different levels of public debt. In the case of Sri Lanka, the crisis occurred when its debt to GDP was higher than 100 percent of GDP, but regarding Pakistan, debt financing difficulties were seen at a much lower level—at around 75 percent of GDP. A literature survey on public debt sustainability also shows no agreed-upon debt sustainability threshold. Moreover, the critically acclaimed book This Time is Different, written by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, points out that debt defaults have occurred at levels below 40 percent of the Gross National Product. Hence, the current debt levels should not create complacency that stalls public finance reforms. Public debt, in certain instances, is indispensable, and its just use can be instrumental in the development of a country and the welfare of its citizens. However, considering Sri Lanka and Pakistan’s experiences, it is also true that mismanagement of public finances can inflict significant pain on ordinary citizens and lead the economy down a path below its potential for a long time. Hence, it is imperative that Nepal put its public finances in order. The right time to do that is now when the crisis is not imminent.  \nCuba’s electrical grid collapsed again on Sunday, the fourth such failure in 48 hours, with a hurricane making landfall to compound the island’s misery and threaten further havoc on its decrepit infrastructure.Cuba earlier on Sunday had said it was making headway restoring service after multiple false starts, though millions of people remained without electricity more than two days after the grid’s initial collapse.“Restoration work began immediately,” the country’s energy and mines ministry said on X.Hurricane Oscarmade landfall on the Caribbean island on Sunday, bringing strong winds, a powerful storm surge and rain to parts of eastern Cuba and threatening to further complicate the government’s efforts to reestablish service.Cuba’s meteorological survey warned of “an extremely dangerous situation” in eastern Cuba, while the US National Hurricane Center reported winds of 75 miles per hour (120 kph) as the storm made its way across the island.“On the forecast track, the centre of Oscar is expected to continue moving across eastern Cuba tonight and Monday, then emerge off the northern coast of Cuba late Monday and cross the central Bahamas on Tuesday,” the Hurricane Center said.The Communist-run government cancelled school through Wednesday - a near unprecedented move in Cuba - citing the hurricane and the ongoing energy crisis. Officials said only essential workers should report to work on Monday.The repeated grid collapses marked a major setback in the government’s efforts to quickly restore power to exhausted residents already suffering from severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.The multiple setbacks in the first 48 hours also underscored the complexity of the work and the still precarious state of the country’s grid.Cuba had restored power to 160,000 clients in Havana just prior to the grid’s Sunday collapse, giving some residents a glimmer of hope.But housewife Anabel Gonzalez, of old Havana, a neighbourhood popular with tourists, said she was growing desperate after three days without power.“My cell phone is dead and look at my refrigerator. The little that I had has all gone to waste,” she said, pointing to bare shelves in her two-room home.Energy and mines minister Vicente de la O Levy told reporters earlier on Sunday he expected the grid to be fully functional by Monday or Tuesday but warned residents not to expect dramatic improvements.It was not immediately clear how much the latest setback would delay the government’s efforts.Cuba’s national electrical grid first crashed around midday on Friday after the island's largest power plant shut down, sowing chaos. The grid collapsed again on Saturday morning, state-run media reported.By early evening on Saturday, authorities reported some progress restoring power before announcing another partial grid collapse.RISING TENSIONSReuters reporters witnessed two small protests overnight after a grid failure left Havana in the dark late Saturday, one on the outskirts of the capital in Marianao and the other in the more central Cuatro Caminos. Various videos of protests elsewhere in the capital began to crop up on social media late on Saturday, though Reuters was not able to verify their authenticity.Energy Minister O Levy said the blackouts were bothersome to residents, but he said most Cubans understood and supported government efforts to restore power.“It is Cuban culture to cooperate,”O Levy told reporters on Sunday. “Those isolated and minimal incidents that do exist, we catalog them as incorrect, as indecent.”Internet traffic dropped off sharply in Cuba over the weekend, according to data from internet monitoring group NetBlocks, as vast power outages made it all but impossible for most island residents to charge phones and get online.“Network data show that Cuba remains largely offline as the island experiences a second nationwide power outage,” Netblocks said on Saturday.The government has blamed weeks of worsening blackouts - as long as 10 to 20 hours a day across much of the island - on deteriorating infrastructure, fuel shortages and rising demand.Cuba also blames the US trade embargo, as well as sanctions instituted by then-President Donald Trump, for ongoing difficulties in acquiring fuel and spare parts to operate and maintain its oil-fired plants.The US has denied any role in the grid failures.Cuba depends on imports to feed its largely obsolete, oil-fired power plants. Fuel deliveries to the island have dropped significantly this year as Venezuela, Russia and Mexico, once important suppliers, have slashed their exports to Cuba.Ally Venezuela - struggling to supply its own market - cut by half its deliveries of subsidized fuel to Cuba this year, forcing the island to search for more costly oil on the spot market.Mexico, another frequent supplier, appeared also to have cut fuel flows to Cuba during a presidential election year.Recently elected President Claudia Sheinbaum has not said if the state-supported supply to Cuba will continue under same terms under her administration. \nToday the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in Lumbini Province and the hilly regions of the country and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at one or two places of Lumbini Province and hilly regions of the country.The Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast chances of light snowfall at one or two places of the high hilly and mountainous region of the country.Tonight the weather will be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country. Light rain or thunder and lightning is likely to occur at one or two places of the hilly region of the country.According to the Meteorological Analysis, the current weather conditions are primarily influenced by the westerly wind system, which has an effect across the country, along with some impact from local winds.On Sunday, Dhangadhi recorded the highest maximum temperature at 34°C, while Jumla experienced the lowest minimum temperature at 7.5°C. \nThe torment began when she started Primary 1, and ended only when she left the school two years later.New to a popular all-girls school, a seven-year-old quickly became a target of bullying by more than one group of her peers. A few pupils spread rumours that she had cheated in her exams, while another threw rubbish into her school bag, crushed her homework, licked her snacks and hid her stationery.A teacher took away an award she had earned for doing well in an assignment because of remarks that other girls had made, and she had to put a padlock on her bag to protect her belongings.“I noticed something was wrong when my daughter was crying more often,” said her mother, Mrs Rachel Tan (not her real name), a housewife in her early 50s.Mrs Tan and her daughter both struggled to raise these encounters to teachers or the school, as there was no hard evidence. And when Mrs Tan tried to talk to a teacher about the rumours other girls had spread, nothing came of it.At one point, Mrs Tan had to help her daughter practise how to defend herself in school. “I imagined helping her practise for oral exams, but not to stand up to her bullies.”Her daughter escaped her bullies after moving to a new school in 2024, where she is doing better and has made new friends, Mrs Tan said. But she worries that the experience has left her child emotionally scarred and that she may not easily trust people or form friendships.While the number of bullying incidents reported to the Ministry of Education (MOE) has been stable in the past decade, observers say teenage bullying is a growing concern, especially with new tools of social media and texting that have opened up ways for bullies to hurt people.Technology has also drawn attention to cases of physical bullying that emerge online. Most recently in 2024, videos of at least three cases were widely circulated online and in chat groups.One video uploaded in September shows a boy punching a smaller Qihua Primary Schoolboy.Another video, which surfaced in September, shows a group of Bukit View Secondary School boys taunting a fellow student at the void deck of a Housing Board flat. During the incident, which happened in 2023, one of the boys grabbed the student’s backpack before kicking him and sending him flying.In August, videos posted on Facebook show people being slapped, punched and kicked at ITE College Central.In October, Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Zaobao reported that a Secondary 1 student from Meridian Secondary School suffered a rupture in her right eardrum after her schoolmates allegedly slapped and hit her for 20 minutes. About two in every 1,000 primary school pupils report bullying incidents each year, and the figure for secondary school students is five in every 1,000, said MOE, without disclosing exact figures. But observers told The Straits Times that these statistics may not fully reflect the extent of the problem, because children fear the possibility of retaliation from bullies and may not fully understand what they are going through.Physical bullying incidents are the tip of the iceberg, they said. Other forms of aggression like psychological or verbal bullying – offline and online – often go undetected, as these are less obvious, and children feel they may not warrant the same level of attention.“Children can worry about appearing petty to their teachers and classmates,” said Ms Sandy Ho, a counsellor from MindfulBear, a private centre that specialises in counselling for children and teenagers. This often results in them choosing to keep quiet and ignoring the issue, she added.Hidden violence, but harmfulAnother parent, who wanted to be known only as Madam M, said her 10-year-old child tolerated her schoolmates’ taunting for almost a year.She said they said words like “oh sh*t” when her daughter walked past them, whispered and pointed at her, and bad-mouthed her to others in front of her. One girl also kicked her daughter in the shin.Madam M, who is in her 40s, said she did not report the psychological bullying as her daughter had pleaded with her not to, citing reasons like fear of retaliation.The bullies continued ganging up on her daughter and gave her phone number to strangers, getting them to send vulgar and harassing messages to her.It was only when Madam M said she would make a police report that teachers took action. In the meantime, her child was told to be gracious and take different routes in school to avoid the other girls.The bullies were told to write apology letters, which her daughter accepted.“Psychological bullying is very easily deniable and there are no bruises as proof,” said Madam M. “But it should be taken as seriously as physical bullying.”Ms Jane Lim, lead school counsellor from MOE’s guidance branch, Student Development Curriculum Division 1, said that students are taught the channels for reporting bullying incidents.But some may feel unsafe reporting these incidents as they worry about retaliation, she added. “Older students may choose not to report incidents to teachers, and instead seek help from their peers or attempt to resolve the situations on their own,” Ms Lim said.“We frequently remind our students that it is okay to notify teachers and seek help if they are being bullied, or have noticed their friends being bullied.”She added that teachers are trained to identify signs of distress and can support students, some of whom may be referred to a school counsellor.In Secondary 1 and 2, Ms Laurene Chung endured verbal bullying in school that followed her home, in the form of hateful anonymous comments on Ask.fm, a question and answer network, and on social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.Ms Chung, now 25, said: “I had no escape. They told me I was ugly, and started nitpicking parts of my face, like my eyebrows.”A group of five or six female students would pick on her and corner her after morning assembly, not allowing her to go to class. This happened a few times a week.“I feared going to school,” she said. “Until now, I’m not sure what motivated them to pick on me.”In her darkest moments, her confidant was her younger brother, who held her hand as she cried in bed at night.Ms Chung said she did not want her parents to know she was being bullied so as not to worry them. She also did not tell her teachers, for fear that the bullying would worsen or that word would get back to her parents.“Most of my recovery was me reminding myself that it will get better,” she said, and the bullying stopped in Secondary 3 after some girls transferred out of the school.What drives bullies?The causes of bullying are complex but connected, said Ms Ho, the counsellor.Social factors like peer pressure may push people to bully others to gain acceptance or show dominance, while cultural influences – such as aggression depicted in the media – result in children being less aware of the harm they cause, she said.Some who have self-esteem or emotional issues use bullying to feel “in control”, Ms Ho added. Others may have grown up in a violent household, and are more likely to mimic such behaviours. Children in a school environment with “poor supervision and weak anti-bullying measures” may also not understand how their actions hurt others, she said.“Addressing these causes needs a joint effort from families, schools and communities to create a supportive environment that discourages bullying and promotes empathy,” she added.Associate Professor of Psychology (Education) Andree Hartanto from the School of Social Sciences at Singapore Management University said research has shown that cyber-bullying victims are likely to become cyber-bullying perpetrators in the future.“Unlike traditional bullying, which often involves physical disparities – where stronger children or adolescents target physically weaker ones – cyberbullying occurs in the digital realm. This lack of physical confrontation allows victims to become bullies more easily themselves, as they are no longer hindered by physical disadvantage.”Bullying can leave lasting emotional scars, he said.“These emotional traumas can escalate into ongoing issues with self-worth and more serious mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.“Tackling the root causes of bullying requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses both the individual needs of the bully and the broader social context in which bullying occurs,” he added.-In association with the Asia News Network \nAfter the Nepal Police arrested Rabi Lamichhane, the president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the former deputy prime minister, on Friday for his alleged involvement in the misuse of cooperative funds, people are now asking what will happen to Nepali Congress Vice President Dhanaraj Gurung and CPN-UML lawmaker Rishikesh Pokharel, who are also accused in similar offences.Supporters of Lamichhane took to the streets in Kathmandu and Pokhara, calling for the arrest of Gurung and Pokharel. They held placards with the names of Lamichhane, Gurung and Pokharel, questioning whether the ruling party lawmakers would also be arrested. Lamichhane is currently in the custody of the District Police Office, Kaski after a complaint was lodged against him for allegedly misusing funds from the Suryadarshan Cooperative in Pokhara. He is also being investigated for organised crime.However, the Department of Cooperatives has said no complaints have been filed regarding the alleged misuse of cooperative funds by Gurung and Pokharel. “Our department has not received any complaints against the cooperatives involving Gurung and Pokharel,” Tol Raj Upadhyaya, the spokesperson of the Department of Cooperatives, told the Post. “Complaints related to cooperatives are reported at the provincial or local level as well, so if there are complaints against them, they may have been filed there.” The information officer of the Ministry of Industry, Agriculture, and Cooperative of Koshi Province, Lila Ballav Chapagain, said no complaints have been registered against Pokharel and his wife, Anjala Koirala, at the provincial level. Chapagain also said that the cooperative organisation concerned is currently not functional.UML leader Pokharel, who chairs the Federal Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, has also been accused of embezzling cooperative funds. His wife, Anjala, previously served on the board of Umagauri Agricultural Cooperative as a director. She is accused of embezzling Rs140 million from the organisation located at Karsiya Baza in ward 4 of Dhanpal Nath Rural Municipality in Morang. The cooperative is now defunct.Pokharel has been denying any wrongdoing by himself or his wife. “My wife was merely a witness when some other people from the cooperative took out loans, but this fact has been distorted to cover up the wrongdoings of others,” Pokharel claimed.“I will defend myself when the new session of the Parliament starts. However, I am also open to an investigation if the state agency wants.” Pokharel said that he, as the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, raised concerns about corruption in various sectors and claimed that those under investigation have orchestrated a false narrative against him and his wife. He claimed that the CPN (Maoist Centre) was orchestrating the schemes against him and his wife. Pokharel’s claim holds some water, as he was targeted by the CPN (Maoist Centre) amid escalating tensions within the government. In July, the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) cut off power to six industrial firms that failed to pay the tariff for using a specialised feeder and trunk line for electricity. For days, despite a written order from the Electricity Regulatory Commission and the verbal instructions from Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, NEA chief Kulman Ghising refused to restore power to the six firms. After a conflict arose between NEA chief Ghising and Prime Minister Oli, the Public Accounts Committee, headed by Pokharel, raised the issue of corruption at the NEA. In response, leaders of the Maoist Centre leaders brought up allegations of cooperative fraud, suggesting that Pokharel was attempting to deflect attention away from him.However, Maoist Centre chief whip Hitraj Pandey says that Pokharel and his wife's involvement in cooperative fraud did not come out of nowhere in the media.“But we fear that as the current government intends to take action against those not in its favour, it might protect those close to it,” Pandey told the Post. “Regarding Pokharel and his wife’s involvement in the cooperative fraud case, the parliamentary special probe committee, which submitted its report last month, also mentions them.”However, the report does not explicitly name Pokharel and his wife. “Since there were no complaints against them, our committee did not investigate Pokharel and his wife,” UML lawmaker Sarita Bhusal, who served as a member of the parliamentary special probe committee on cooperatives scam, told the Post.With no complaint lodged against UML lawmaker Pokharel and his wife, the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police has began investigating the alleged fraud involving the Miteri Savings and Credit Cooperative, which is connected to Congress Vice President Dhan Raj Gurung and his former wife, Jyoti Gurung. CIB spokesperson Hobindra Bogati said they are thoroughly reviewing the complaint against the Miteri Cooperatives. “We are investigating the complaint against Miteri Cooperative, where Dhanraj Gurung and his former wife are allegedly involved,” Bogati told the Post.After the cooperative’s chairman, Kumbharaj Gurung, filed a complaint with the Department of Cooperatives in August, alleging that Jyoti Gurung, the general manager, embezzled Rs12.5 million, Congress Vice-President Gurung also came under scrutiny. Jyoti Gurung is Dhanaraj Gurung's former wife.Gurung has denied his involvement in the scam, arguing that his former wife, with whom he no longer has a relationship, misappropriated the money, so he cannot be held accountable. Despite Gurung’s claim that he separated from his wife in 2019, Miteri Cooperative chair Kumbharaj reported he had registered a complaint against the Gurung duo and informed law enforcement agencies that the lawmaker continued to pay off the debts in his wife’s name until last year. Various copies of the vouchers Dhan Raj Gurung reportedly used to deposit money into the cooperative’s account have surfaced in various media outlets.After being charged with embezzling the cooperative's funds, Dhan Raj Gurung, speaking in Parliament on September 10, called for a proper investigation to clear his name. A parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives submitted its report last month. The committee also recommended investigating Gurung and his former wife for misusing the cooperative’s funds.  \nThe government has formed a high-level study and recommendation committee to develop a safe, reliable, and trustworthy civil aviation system in Nepal.According to Minister for Communication and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Cabinet, on Friday, decided to establish a five-member committee headed by former Supreme Court Justice Anil Kumar Sinha. “The committee is tasked with conducting a comprehensive study and analysis of Nepal’s civil aviation sector and providing recommendations to improve safety, reliability, and credibility,” he said.The Council of Ministers also approved the terms of reference of the committee. Other members of the committee include air traffic management expert Rajendra Bahadur Singh, aviation safety expert Bhesh Raj Subedi, air service operations and quality management expert Captain Riwaj Prasad Pradhan, and a Joint Secretary from the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation. \nThe Kaski District Court on Sunday remanded Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane into custody for six days for further investigation on charges of cooperative fund embezzlement and organised crime.Lamichhane was arrested by a team of the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) from his party office in Kathmandu on Friday. He was subsequently brought to Pokhara, where he was presented before the court on Sunday. The court, led by Judge Navaraj Dahal, granted permission for the six-day remand following a request from the police.Lamichhane, along with several other individuals, is accused of being involved in misappropriating funds from the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Savings and Credit Cooperative. The arrest followed a parliamentary probe which linked him and others to the embezzlement of millions of rupees from the cooperative.The court had previously issued arrest warrants against 14 individuals, with investigations being conducted into their involvement. So far, over 60 people have been implicated in the cooperative’s financial irregularities, with seven, including Gorkha Media Network’s director Chhabilal Joshi, held in custody pending trial.Meanwhile, protests have been staged both in favour of and against Lamichhane in Pokhara, with RSP supporters rallying for his release and cooperative victims demanding his detention for further investigation into the fraud allegations.The police remain on alert to prevent any escalation as parallel demonstrations continue.Earlier, District Administration Office, Kaski had issued a prohibitory order on Sunday afternoon to avoid a possible clash between the protesting parties. \nBillionaire Elon Musk promised on Saturday to give away $1 million each day until November’s election to someone who signs his online petition supporting the US Constitution.And he wasted no time, awarding a $1 million check to an attendee of his event in Pennsylvania aimed at rallying supporters behind Republican Donald Trump. The winner was a man named John Dreher, according to event staff.“By the way, John had no idea. So anyway, you’re welcome,” the Tesla founder said as he handed Dreher the check.The money is the latest example of Musk using his extraordinary wealth to influence the tightly contested presidential race between Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris.Musk started America PAC, a political action organization he founded in support of Trump’s presidential campaign. The group is helping mobilize and register voters in battleground states, but there are signs it is having trouble meeting its goals.The Harrisburg event is the third in as many days in Pennsylvania, where Musk is painting November’s election in stark terms and encouraging supporters to vote early and get others to do the same.He said on Saturday that if Harris wins, it will be “the last election,” suggesting the US will no longer exist.He also said the two assassination attempts against Trump prove he is ruffling feathers and upending the status quo in ways Harris won’t. He said that’s why no one is trying to kill Harris.“Assassinating a puppet is worthless, Musk,” said, reiterating an argument he has made in a social media post.The petition Musk is asking people to sign reads: “The First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below, I am pledging my support for the First and Second Amendments.”Attendees of Saturday’s event had to sign the petition, which allows America PAC to garner contact details for more potential voters that it can work to get to the polls for Trump.Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world's richest person, so far has supplied at least $75 million to America PAC, according to federal disclosures, making the group a crucial part of Trump’s bid to regain the White House.The entrepreneur behind carmaker Tesla and rocket and satellite venture SpaceX has increasingly supported Republican causes and this year became an outspoken Trump supporter.Trump in turn has said if elected he would appoint Musk to head a government efficiency commission. \nAmid widespread deaths and devastation caused by monsoon across various districts, Nepal is at a heightened risk for water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne disease outbreaks.With most water sources contaminated by rain and floodwater, and thousands of displaced people living in makeshift shelters, experts have warned of a potential surge in infections in the coming days.“People are already getting infected with water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “These problems could worsen in the coming days.” At least 209 people have been confirmed dead, while 29 others are still missing due to the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking torrential rainfall that started Thursday evening. Additionally, 142 people have sustained various degrees of injury, and more than 4,222 others have been taken to safe places, the Home Ministry said on Monday evening. Doctors warn that the risk of water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne disease outbreaks increases in the aftermath of disasters. Nepal’s past experiences suggest the same.“People are already contracting cholera and other water-borne diseases,” said Dr Pun. “As displaced people mostly live in temporary shelters, the chances of spread of air-borne and vector-borne diseases remain high.”At least 95 people from various districts, including from Kathmandu and Lalitpur, have tested positive for cholera since the start of the monsoon in June. The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Thousands of others were also infected with diarrheal infections after the start of the monsoon season. Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue, usually triggered by unsafe food and water or hygiene issues. Likewise, six people died, and 12,644 others were hospitalised this year due to dengue, which has spread to 76 out of 77 districts across the country. Hundreds of people are contracting seasonal flu, but health authorities have no records of these cases.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are bracing for tough days ahead, as the floodwaters not only contaminate drinking water sources but also create breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“We expect a surge in water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases in the coming days, as it takes a few days for these illnesses to incubate,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have alerted all agencies concerned to step up vigilance and prepare to deal with any adverse situations.”Public health experts have warned that healthcare facilities in the disaster-hit districts could witness an uptick in cases of viral fever cases and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning—and snakebites.Health Ministry officials say that they are aware of the risks and have directed agencies concerned to prepare accordingly.“We have stockpiled essential medicines in districts, provinces and at the central level,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, the secretary at the ministry. “Responding to the looming outbreaks is not only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but also of other ministries and agencies, and we have been coordinating with them as well.”In addition to stepping up surveillance measures, stockpiling medicines, and deploying medics at the health facilities in disaster-hit areas, public health experts emphasise the importance of health awareness in reducing infections.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the possible outbreaks of various ailments.The monsoon in Nepal is itself a season of epidemics with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.In recent years, scientists have gathered credible evidence linking the climate crisis to adverse health effects that impact the quality of life and kill people. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nThe government has reformed the recommendation committee tasked with nominating officials for two key transitional justice bodies: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. The decision was finalised during a Cabinet meeting held on Friday.According to Prithvi Subba Gurung, minister for communication and information technology, the restructured committee will be headed by former Chief Justice Om Prakash Mishra, and its members include former Attorney General Khamba Bahadur Khati, Arjun Kumar Karki, and Stella Tamang. Earlier, top leaders of major political parties including Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chair KP Oli, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Centre) Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal agreed to expedite the remaining tasks related to transitional justice.\"The restructuring aligns with agreements reached among senior political leaders, including Prime Minister Oli, to conclude long-standing transitional justice issues,\" Gurung said.Previously, a similar committee was formed in April but failed to function due to a lack of representation from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). This initiative comes as the two commissions face mounting pressure, with the TRC holding over 63,000 complaints and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons handling around 2,400 cases. Both commissions have been criticised for their inactivity since their inception in 2015. \nThe arrest of former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the chairman of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), has triggered widespread concerns and reactions from different political party leaders. A team of Nepal Police’s Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) arrested Lamichhane from the RSP’s headquarters in Banasthali, Kathmandu on Friday evening.Lamichhane was apprehended to investigate his alleged involvement in cooperative fraud and organised crime. He was subsequently taken by road to the District Police Office in Kaski.A seven-member parliamentary special committee formed in May to investigate the cooperatives scam recommended legal actions against Lamichhane and three other individuals for their involvement in cooperative frauds. He faces allegations of misappropriating funds from a cooperative while serving as the managing director of the Gorkha Media Network that ran now-defunct Galaxy 4k Television before joining politics in June 2022.While leaders of ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML have remained silent on his arrest, there has been a mixed reaction among other party leaders.Speaking with the Post, Nepali Congress spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat said that the investigation agencies arrested Lamichhane as per the finding and recommendation of the parliamentary probe committee.“The report is public now and it was signed by a member of the RSP too,” Mahat said. “Besides the report of the parliamentary committee, the investigating agencies might have collected additional evidence and that must have created a ground for the police to arrest Lamichhane.”Meanwhile, Surya Thapa, who led the parliamentary special committee to probe the crisis-ridden cooperatives, has criticised the RSP leadership for their reaction after Lamichhane’s arrest. RSP leaders have said that Lamichhane’s arrest was motivated by political vendetta. Likening their reaction to ‘an artless drama’, Thapa writes on Facebook, “After the ‘Clean Chit ra Safaai film’ flopped everywhere within a few days, a new artless drama is being staged—‘Vendetta!’”Thapa had earlier come down heavily on Lamichhane and other RSP leaders when they claimed that the committee’s probe could not establish his involvement in cooperative scams.After the Thapa-led committee submitted its report, Lamichhane and RSP leaders had claimed that the parliamentary committee had given a clean chit to him and his involvement in cooperatives fraud could not be established. But Thapa kept on challenging the claim.In the wake of Lamichhane’s arrest, RSP cadres staged protests in Kathmandu, Pokhara and other parts of the country on Saturday. Addressing the protests, the RSP leaders attacked the leadership of the present government. Some RSP leaders like vice-president Swarnim Wagle and acting spokesperson Manish Jha, among others, condemned Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, and Foreign Minister Arzu Rana, among others.Meanwhile, Deputy General Secretary of CPN (Maoist Centre) and former minister Barsha Man Pun has demanded the arrest of Nepali Congress vice-president Dhanraj Gurung and UML lawmaker Rishikesh Pokhrel, who is also the chair of Public Accounts Committee of the House of Representatives, two leaders who are also alleged to be involved in the cooperatives scam.Speaking with reporters in Rolpa, Pun said that Gurung and Pokhrel should not be exempted and there should not be double standards in arresting the alleged in the cooperatives scam. “Whatever is happening with Rabi Lamichhane should also happen with Gurung and Rishikesh,” Pun said, according to a statement issued by his private secretariat.Mahat, the Nepali Congress spokesperson, said that they are always open for any kind of investigation on Gurung. “Our party has never blocked any kind of investigation against him,” he said.Former Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai, who is also the chairman of Nepal Samajbadi Party, said that Lamichanne should cooperate in the police investigation but he has full sympathy for him.He said Lamichhane has to go through the investigation process even if there is no truth in the accusation he has faced. “I have my full sympathy for him as he himself has said that he would help in the investigation process,” Bhattarai said. “I think he has to help duly end the investigation process.” The former prime minister stated that because there is rule of law in a democracy, whoever is found guilty, big or small, should be punished.The Kaski district police will produce Lamichanne in court on Sunday. \nPolice on Friday evening arrested Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair and former deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane on the charges of cooperatives fraud and organised crime.If the investigating officers don’t add to the list of crimes, they need to complete the entire investigation within 60 days and then submit a report to the Kaski District Attorney’s Office. The attorney’s office will then lodge the case in the Kaski District Court. However, if the police probe him for money laundering, too, they will have an additional 30 days to wrap up the investigation.Based on complaints from depositors at the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, the police apprehended the journalist-turned-politician to probe his involvement in the embezzlement of millions of rupees of public money. The district court will decide whether he is guilty of the allegations.If found guilty on both counts, he can face a jail term of over a decade. But if convicted of money laundering, he will not be able to return to parliamentary politics, as per existing legal provisions. However, he can challenge the district court’s decision in a higher court. The Supreme Court’s ruling will be final.The Cooperatives Act defines cooperatives fraud and prescribes jail terms and penalties. Clause 50 of the Act prohibits lending—or investing—cooperatives’ deposits to those who are not members. Various studies, including by the Parliamentary Special Committee, have found that money from Suryadarshan Cooperative was channelled to the Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane was once the managing director.If his involvement is established in transferring the money, he can face a year in jail and Rs100,000 in fine, as per Clause 124 (a) of the Act. Similarly, the RSP supremo may be prosecuted for causing harm to the cooperative, which is a criminal offence, according to Clause 122 (k) of the Act.If found guilty, Lamichhane faces 8 to 10 years of prison, along with a fine equal to the amount the cooperative suffered in losses. In addition, property equal to the amount can be confiscated from him.Being convicted of cooperatives’ fraud will pause his parliamentary politics for six years. The Act Relating to the Election of the Member of House of Representatives says a person convicted of a crime with less than 20 years of jail term is ineligible to contest election for six years after the completion of the imprisonment. The same provision applies to other elections as well.“Lamichhane will not be eligible to contest at least one election if he gets convicted in cooperatives’ fraud,” said Mohan Lal Acharya, a constitutional lawyer.The penalty for organised crime is still higher. The Prevention of the Organised Crime Act 2013 says that if any crime is found to be conducted in an organised manner, imprisonment can increase by 50 percent. In that case, Lamichhane can face a maximum jail term of 12 to 15 years. Just as with cooperatives’ fraud, in this case too he would have to wait for six years after completing the sentence to make a comeback in parliamentary politics.Lamichhane, however, can never come back to politics if he gets convicted of money laundering. Along with money laundering, those convicted of corruption, rape, human trafficking, passport misuse and abduction are not allowed to contest elections.However, those who have already been elected as members of Parliament will not lose their positions. They only remain suspended. As per the House of Representatives regulations, no lawmaker is suspended until s/he faces judicial custody or is convicted. So, Lamichhane will remain a member of the lower house until he is sent to judicial custody.He will not lose the position even if he is convicted of the crimes he is charged with. “Any lawmaker convicted in any criminal offence will remain suspended during the period of his/her jail term,” reads section 248 (4) of the regulation. Even as such lawmakers do not lose their position, they don’t get any pay and perks during their suspension period. \nChairman of CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Netra Bikram Chand, general secretary of Nepal Community Party, shared a stage in Bharatpur, Chitwan on Saturday and underscored the need for party unification among all the Maoist outfits in the country. Attending a programme organised at Bharatpur Metropolitan City-13, Dahal and Chand jointly urged all the Maoist groups to make a stronger political force in the present context of Nepal.“I will move forward for party unity unequivocally,” said Dahal, the former prime minister and parliamentary party leader of the main opposition party in the House of Representatives. “We will have to regain the political strength the party had in 2008 [during the first election of Constituent Assembly].”The then CPN (Maoist) led by Dahal was the largest party in the first Constituent Assembly election held in 2008. The party later split into various outfits including the Chand-led Nepal Communist Party. Speaking at the programme, Dahal appealed to participants to make a united Maoist party by the upcoming general election of 2027.Similarly, Chand also emphasised for unity among the Maoist parties to resolve the current political problems in the country. “If all the Maoist parties come together and contest the upcoming general election, the united party will be as it was in the Constituent Assembly election in 2008,” Chand said. He urged all the Maoist breakaway factions not to criticise one another but to move forward united for the welfare of the country and people.In another context, Chand lambasted the Rastriya Swatantra Party led by Rabi Lamichhane, who is currently in police custody on charges of cooperative fraud and organised crime. He said the party “established overnight” has confused the people. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nUntil two years ago, growing crops was a big challenge for farmer Jit Bahadur Khamcha Magar of Palpa in western Nepal. He had been a victim of the monkey menace for years. But these days Magar of Phek Dangsinghdanda, Ribdikot rural municipality-8 is not much worried. He plans to earn Rs700,000 from the same land which until two years ago yielded nothing because monkeys, including other wild animals, ate up all the crops. Some farmers even left the village.Magar's life suddenly changed after he started growing chillies. Monkeys don’t like chillies and they don't even come close to the crop. Till October, he sold chillies worth Rs 350,000 and plans to double the income by the end of this year. He has cultivated round chillies on three ropanies of land.“Previously, the crops were destroyed by monkeys, porcupines, boars and other animals. My income was just zero two years back,” said Magar. “This year, I expect a good earning as the chilli variety I’ve grown is highly demanded in the market.”Bishnu Bahadur Karki from Bhairabstan, Ribdikot rural municipality-4 hopes to earn Rs800,000 this year from round chilies. He has already made nearly a half of that. He still plans to earn Rs450,000 from the sales of round chillies.Karki, who has cultivated round chillis on six ropanis, said that the price of round chillies has nearly doubled this year.“We have not only got the value for our products, but market access too,” said Karki. “As the price is fixed in advance, it is less risky for farmers.”Besides Magar and Karki, nearly 1,500 farmers from Ribdikot rural municipality-8 are making an income from the crop. Ribdikot, once known for ginger production, now sees a future in round chilli cultivation.Round chillies were primarily cultivated in Ilam, Panchthar, Dhakuta of the east. Four years ago, round chillies were planted in Ribdikot as a trial but later the rural municipality earned more than Rs60 million from the commodity, and encouraged more farmers to grow the crop in a commercial way.With the increase in the value of round chilli this year, farmers easily managed the expenses for their festivities.“We used to take loans to celebrate festivals. But with the round chilli farming boom, we need no loans from anyone,” said Sita Khamcha of Phake, Ribdikot rural municipality. She hopes to earn Rs500,000 from round chillies.Last year, round chillies fetched Rs150 per kg but this year the minimum price has been set at Rs220 per kg. The floor price was set in coordination with Ribdikot rural municipality, said Sita. Farmers are getting Rs260 per kg.Farmers said the market is no problem for round chillies—both red and green varieties. Narayan Bahadur GC, a former ward chairman, is the director of Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udyog. He introduced round chillies to local farmers with the support from the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation Project. “In Palpa, it is now grown commercially,” said GC. Initially, there was no certainty whether the output would be good, he added. Janak Acharya of Palungmainadi who cultivated round chillies on 200 ropanies as trial.Round chilli cultivation expanded after the local government encouraged farmers in every ward, providing them with training and subsidies in seed purchase.GC is working on the marketing of round chillies.The Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udyog collects round chillies from farmers, ensures its market and grades the output. Production of green chillies starts from May. This facilitation has encouraged farmers to engage in round chilli farming, said Ranjib Kunwar, manager of Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udhyog.Kunwar said that most of the farmers bring their chilies to the factory. The farmers who do not take round chillies to the factory also make transactions of Rs10.5 million separately by selling them in the market. Traders supply round chillies to Butwal, Bhairahawa, Tansen and Pokhara.Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udhyog sells red round chillies to noodle producers.Farmers of Ribdikot hope to earn Rs60 million from round chillies this year.So far, farmers have already sold round chillies for more than Rs30 million.Though the rural municipality supported round chilli cultivation in initial days, lately it has been providing subsidies in seeds only. \nA couple from Baglung has found their calling in baking bread and pastries.Deepak Gautam and his wife Sanam start early each day at 5 am. Deepak personally delivers bread, pastries, doughnuts, and puffs to grocery shops, hotels, and restaurants. Once he returns in the afternoon, he gets back to baking.Deepak supplies bread to 120 grocery stores daily. The secret to their success lies in their disciplined routine. He rarely gets a chance to rest because he works tirelessly throughout the day—rain or shine. For the past eight years, Gautam has operated a bread factory at Shivadhara Chowk in ward 2 of Baglung Municipality, while the couple lives in ward 7.In a time when many youths are migrating abroad and see no future in Nepal, the story of Deepak, 37, and Sanam, 30, stands out as exceptional.The couple has been making bread with 50 kg of refined flour daily. They have hired three workers in the factory. They also run a shop at the factory where customers frequently order birthday cakes. On some days, they receive as many as 20 birthday cake orders. They make around Rs24,000 daily from their ‘The Star Bakery’ and its popularity continues to grow.“People used to view tea and bread shops differently in the past. However, it’s changing now as bakeries have become commercial and an integral part of daily life and celebrations,” said Deepak. Deepak is proud of his work as he has set an example that hard work pays off.Recently, he has started baking Korean bread, a skill he picked while working as a migrant worker in Korea. After returning to Nepal, he opened a tea shop in partnership with his elder brother Tulasi.Named ‘Pragati Pratibha Chiya Pasal’, a tea shop is now run by his wife and his sister-in-law (Tulasi's wife) and has become quite popular. It serves hundreds of cups of tea daily.Deepak has been operating the bakery business for the past eight years.Although there are a few other bakeries in the district, and all have been doing well, The Star Bakery stands out, according to retailers.“There are many bakeries, but most consumers ask for products from The Star Bakery,” said Khagendra Poudel, a local retailer. Known for his gentle demeanour, Deepak personally delivers bakery items to shops and homes. He has earned respect for his integrity as he carefully keeps a record of goods delivered to shop and collects payments occasionally.“Deepak accepts payment only after the sale of bakery items and takes back unsold items,” said Tal Bahadur Kunwar, a local hotelier. “The bakery products are excellent. People love them.”Retailers and entrepreneurs appreciate Deepak's flexibility in allowing them to pay after the products are sold.Initially, Deepak faced struggles. He used to bake bread using a traditional fire oven called Bhatti, which caused smoke pollution in the neighbourhood. So using his savings from five years of work in South Korea, he invested in a modern factory and installed an electric oven.“I used to work in different sectors while in Korea, but volunteered at a nearby bakery shop and learned the skill.”He invested Rs1 million in an oven and another Rs1.5 million in flour-mixing machines. He also built a home and bought a motorbike for deliveries. Despite these investments, his funds were not enough. But he received support from his wife, and Deepak managed to increase his income and he also makes regular savings in a credit cooperative.However, when the directors of Shiva Shikhar Cooperatives fled last year, he lost all his savings.The cooperative's collapse ruined Deepak, including many entrepreneurs. But Deepak's hard work continues.Now, Deepak has abandoned any plans of going abroad again. He has started saving in a commercial bank and plans to upgrade his business.He has also requested the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control to conduct lab tests on his bakery products. But, expired bakery items present a new challenge, he said.“If I miss removing expired products daily, the government’s inspection team could punish me. So I am more worried than the customers,” Deepak said. His bakery items are good for five days after production. “But breads from other factories have an expiry date of 10 days,” said Poudel. “As The Star Bakery's bread is fresher and has a shorter shelf life, the demand for it is higher.”XXXXXXXXPhoto caption:Deepak Gautam (left) and his wife Sanam in this combination photo. \n\nFifty-three trekking trails were developed in Baglung in the last fiscal year to draw foreigners and local tourists, considering rural tourism's contribution to rural community development.A trekking route has been built to Teuwa, where a statue of Gautam Buddha has been constructed in the Open Sculpture Museum of Galkot Municipality.An hour-long hiking trail to Teuwa from Harichaur has been the latest draw for youth.Similarly, another trekking route has been developed to connect Kot Ghar, which once served as the fortress of the hilly kingdom ruled by the Mallas. The renovated historical palace offers a reason to visit Galkot. Kot Ghar, once considered the seat of powerful Malla kings of Galkot, a pretty kingdom in the confederation of 24 states known as Chaubise Rajya, has been restored and preserved to draw tourists. The Kot Ghar means a house where weapons are placed or stored.Mahadev Sapkota, a tourism entrepreneur, said that the construction of trekking trails in Baur, Kothekhola rural municipality-7 to Gumba has been attracting locals to the two-day hiking trail. In the last fiscal year, local governments constructed 53 trails in the district, spending Rs1 million to Rs2 million in each project.“We have been observing an influx of youth for trekking after the development of trekking trains,” said Prem Lamichhane, chairman of ward 9 of Kothekhola Rural Municipality. Bishnu Nath Sharma, information officer of the Tourism and Industry Office of the Galkot Municipality, said that the trekking routes with homestays have been attracting domestic tourists in the area. The Tourism and Industry Office of the Gandaki province in Baglung funded Rs66 million to construct the trails.Locals said that many infrastructure projects are unfinished, but the construction of trekking routes has become successful and meets the objective of community development.“For hiking of a day or two, the trail has become easy and attractive,” said Saurab Khatri, a youth of ward 9 of Baglung Municipality. “There is a need to promote these destinations to bring tourists.” Khatri prefers to hike rather than use the vehicle. “The trail has grabbed the attention of many youths like us.” In the last fiscal year, 73 tourism infrastructure projects were completed through the Tourism and Industry Office. With the expenditure under Rs500,000 to Rs2 million, most of the projects were trail construction. There are concerns that small projects are delayed and unfinished. Paar Singh Thapa, chief of the Tourism and Industry Office, said the tourism infrastructure project achieves 95 percent of physical progress. The trail has been constructed to connect the religious sites. Besides trekking trails and homestays, meditation centres have been constructed in two Buddhist sites. Thapa said the projects will increase economic activities by alluring tourists and conserving religious places. The office has also invested in developing Durleni, in Baglung, as a tourism destination.The Baglung municipality has allocated Rs25 million to develop the area as a tourism destination. Similarly, the tourism office has invested Rs1.5 million to construct a martyr's memorial park at Argal in ward 2 of Tarakhola Rural Municipality. “Investing in similar work can be repetitive. In such a situation, the office needs to be responsible,” said Amar Thapa, chief of the District Coordination Committee. “We have directed the authorities to prevent the duplication and implement such projects that yield results. The office has made investments to identify many places. A master plan has been formulated to develop tourism sites. Bharat Sharma, mayor of Galkot Municipality, said they had demanded a budget of Rs20 million to develop major sites as per the master plan. However, in some areas, the budget has been frozen as the project did not move ahead. The budget allocated under Ghumte Tourism Development in the last fiscal year was frozen. Rs1.5 million has been invested to maintain Udaya Righa Buddha Bihar, located in Righa Ward No.11 in Galkot, along with the trail. Rs1 million has been allocated for the construction of a tourism trail from Gaighat waterfall of the Tara River to Baraha Lake. Similarly, Rs1 million has been invested to construct tourism infrastructure in Soledada at Tamankhola rural municipality, Rs1 million for the construction of Jaimini Dham Meditation Center, and Rs2 million for tourism infrastructure in Kuduledham. Thapa said that tourism arrivals will rise as infrastructure has been built and renovated in the coming days. Thapa said a temporary assistant engineer from the Tourism and Industry Office is doing all the technical work on the projects. The local government has been trying to preserve the historical artefacts to showcase to visitors. The ancient palace of Galkot was in dire straits because of the lack of conservation.The Shreemeher Battalion barracks of the Nepal Army and Galkot Municipality have jointly renovated the almost-collapsed Kot Ghar. \nAround 2.1 million children between six and 59 months across the country are being administered vitamin A supplements in the two-day nationwide campaign that started on Friday.Of them, 1.9 million children between 12 months to 59 months are also being administered with deworming tablets, according to the Nutrition Section of the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services.“The vitamin A and deworming campaign has been running smoothly all over the country today (Friday),” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the section. “We will request all parents of eligible children to ensure that their children are administered with vitamin A supplements and deworming tablets.”Around 52,000 female community health volunteers have been deployed nationwide for the campaign. The health ministry has been conducting it twice a year—in April and October—since 2003.Officials say that vitamin A supplementation and a deworming tablet administration campaigns are crucial in preventing many childhood diseases and reducing mortality among children under five.It is because of supplementation campaigns like these that night blindness among children, which used to be very high until two decades ago, has been almost eliminated, according to Thapa.Vitamin A deficiency is estimated to contribute to nearly one-fourth of global child mortality from measles, diarrhoea and malaria.The campaign is a success story in Nepal, as it has helped tackle the issue of vitamin A deficiency among children, which used to be a major public health problem in the country. Regular supplementation campaigns are estimated to have reduced deaths among children under five by 23 percent.Deworming tablets are crucial to preventing many childhood diseases and reducing the mortality rate among children under five, according to child health experts.The vitamin A supplementations and the deworming campaign had coverage rates of over 94 percent, the highest among all health campaigns run in the country in the past. However, the coverage declined to just over 80 percent in recent years.Child health experts say that vitamin A supplementation campaigns are important for children's overall growth and for protecting them from various infectious diseases.According to the World Health Organization, vitamin A deficiency causes visual impairment (night blindness) and vulnerability to illnesses like measles and diarrhoea among children. The supplement boosts immunity and ensures children’s natural growth. \nOf six seriously ill patients receiving intensive care at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital on Friday, five are infected with the dengue virus.The hospital’s emergency department, which treated 35 patients within 24 hours on Friday, said that 23 of them (or 66 percent) were dengue cases.“Of late, the number of dengue cases has grown alarmingly in Kathmandu Valley,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director of the hospital. “Seventy to 80 dengue patients seek care at our hospital daily.”What concerns doctors is that the number of severe dengue cases is rising along with the number of mild cases. According to Basaula, the number of patients with severe stomach pain, vomiting, and bleeding from nose, gums, and stool is increasing.“We transfuse platelets to the patients whose platelets count is too low,” said Basaula. “We advise those suffering from severe dengue not to wait at home for too long and to seek hospital care as soon as possible.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.At least nine deaths and over 20,000 infections have been reported from all 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms.The post-monsoon period is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the beginning of the year and across the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons.“Hundreds of people in the Kathmandu Valley might have been infected with dengue virus in recent days,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “As post-monsoon is the peak dengue season, neither the general public nor the authorities concerned have taken the issue seriously, and the rise in infection rate was obvious.”Doctors at Patan Hospital have also reported a surge in dengue infections in recent days.“On Thursday, 38 patients with high fever tested positive for dengue,” said Dr Ravi Shakya, director at the hospital. “Along with a surge in new infections, the number of complicated cases has also been rising.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population also said the number of dengue infections has surged in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur—as well as in Tanahun and Kaski, among other districts.“It is true that the number of complicated dengue cases have risen,” Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, the federal epidemic control body, concedes. “Even though dengue infections and complications have risen, case fatality has not.”To make matters worse, the surge in dengue cases has, of late, caused a critical shortage of blood in the Kathmandu Valley. The Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank) said that hospitals in the Valley have been facing a surge in demand for platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate due to the spike in dengue cases.“The daily demand for blood and blood components is about 400 pints, but we have only been able to collect about 20 to 30 pints,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, senior technical officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service. “We urge everyone eligible to come forward and donate blood. We have been struggling to meet the demand, and families of critically ill patients are in a difficult situation as they can’t find blood.”Officials attributed the decline in blood collection to the Dashain holidays. They say the closure of colleges for the Dashain holidays and the suspension of blood donation campaigns by many offices and organisations during the festival have led to a sharp drop in donations.In a bid to manage the acute blood crisis in the Valley, the blood bank on Thursday brought blood from Simara in Bara district.“We brought 112 pints of blood from Simara on Thursday to address the shortfall in Kathmandu,” said Yadav. “But we have not been able to meet the growing demands. We have been requesting all eligible people and organisations to donate, but that too is not yielding desired results. Relatives of patients have been facing a tough time managing the blood needed for their dear ones.”As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms including transfusion of platelet-rich plasma.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nWith the federal government slashing the budget of the nutrition programme, the distribution of fortified flour has been halted in all five districts of Karnali Province since the start of the ongoing fiscal year.Officials admit that the progress in improving nutrition in Karnali Province, achieved through years of efforts and investment, may have been jeopardised due to the suspension of the programme.“Thousands of pregnant women, new mothers, and young children have been deprived of fortified flour, which was crucial in reducing severe malnutrition among these,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The provincial government has started providing Rs2,500 to new mothers, but there is no support for improving the nutrition of young children.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. Stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to a report of the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.Likewise, wasting declined to eight percent from 10 percent in 2016. Wasting or low weight for a particular height is an undernutrition condition, which is a strong predictor of mortality among children under five, according to the World Health Organisation. Wasting in children is associated with a higher risk of death if not treated properly, according to it.Even though the survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. The problem is more prevalent in the Karnali Province. According to the report, over 30 percent of children under five in the province are stunted, the highest in the country, which is an indicator of chronic undernutrition. The province is also the poorest and most food insecure compared to the national average.According to officials, as part of a super flour distribution programme launched in 2014, the government used to provide three kg of flour—fortified with all necessary micronutrients—to pregnant women, new mothers, and children aged six to 24 months every month to address chronic malnutrition problems in the province. For that, the Health Ministry used to allocate Rs 50 million. “This year, around Rs100 million has been cut from the nutrition programme budget and this is the main reason for the stoppage of the fortified flour distribution programme ” said Thapa. “Besides halting the flour distribution, the budget cut will also impact awareness programmes, which are crucial for reducing the burden of problems.”Nutrition experts warn that slashing Karnali Province's nutrition budget will have long-term consequences and could jeopardise the decades of progress in the sector.They say that authorities concerned should have promoted locally available foods, made people aware of the importance of nutritious foods and provided fortified flour to improve nutrition conditions and lessen dependency on freely distributed foods.They say that health authorities must continue awareness programmes to educate people about the importance of healthy food and what they have been providing.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity.Experts say that nutrition has a direct link with the overall development of the country.They add that malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, ultimately affecting the country’s economic health.The Health Ministry had sought help from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address the growing problems of malnutrition in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces in the past.According to Thapa, the federal government has not renewed its contract with the World Food Programme, which provided logistic support for the fortified flour distribution programme.“This year, the government neither has renewed its agreement with the WFP (World Food Programme) nor allocated a budget for continuing the fortified flour distribution programme,” said Thapa.  \nSave the Children Nepal has launched a pilot initiative of introducing ‘rainbow kits’ specifically designed for transgender individuals impacted by disasters.The initiative aims to ensure that transgender people have dignified access to essential hygiene materials during times of humanitarian crisis.The rainbow kits break traditional gender binary norms by addressing the specific needs of the transgender community during humanitarian disasters, such as the recent flood and landslides in Nepal.“The rainbow kits are a response to the limitations of conventional humanitarian dignity and hygiene kits, which often fail to meet the needs of the LGBTQI+ population,” said Tara Chettry, country director for Save the Children in Nepal and Bhutan. “As diversity and inclusivity remain at the heart of Save the Children’s organisational values, I believe this initiative broadens our approach to humanitarian response, encouraging us to view aid through a more targeted and inclusive lens rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.”The kits were officially handed over to the Blue Diamond Society (BDS), a pioneering organisation working for the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals in Nepal. The BDS will distribute these essential kits to those affected by recent floods and landslides, ensuring that the specific hygiene needs of the LGBTQI+ community are met.The rainbow kit includes a carefully curated selection of items designed by Save the Children and the BDS to support health, dignity, and comfort, including condoms and lubricants, sanitary pads/menstrual cups/tampons, wipes, dry tissues, V-wash, panty liners, hot water bags, menstrual panty (free size), towel, hand sanitiser, toothpaste and brush, soap, masks, and other essential items.Tailored kits promote inclusivity and ensure that all identities are recognised and respected, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics, said Manisha Dhakal, executive director of Blue Diamond Society. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal defeated the United States in the Super Over in their second match of the three-match T2oI series at Dallas, US on Sunday.The Rhinos chased the three-run target by the US in the one-over eliminator. With the win, Nepal have clinched the series with a match to spare.The match was pushed to the Super Over following a tie. After winning the toss and opting to bat first, Nepal posted a competitive total of 170-6.Kushal Bhurtel was the star of the innings, anchoring Nepal with an impressive unbeaten 92 from 54 deliveries. His innings featured seven boundaries and six maximums, ensuring Nepal set a challenging target. Anil Sah provided a steady start with 25, while quick cameos from Gulsan Jha (19) and Rohit Paudel (18) bolstered Nepal’s total.In response, the USA also reached 170-8 after 20 overs, leading to a rare and dramatic tie. Andries Gous led the chase for the home side, scoring 62 off 43 balls, while Saiteja Mukkamalla supported with 47 runs from 41 deliveries. However, crucial wickets at regular intervals slowed their momentum. Nepal’s Karan KC was pivotal in the bowling attack, claiming three wickets for 35 runs, while Sompal Kami took two wickets, including key scalps like Aaron Jones and Gous.Dipendra Singh Airee put up an all-round display as Nepal defeated the United States by 17 runs in the first T20I at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Friday.The final match of the series will be played on Monday. \nNepal were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Bhutan in their opening match of the Group B at the SAFF Women’s Championship 2024 at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Friday.This is the first time Nepal have gone winless against a Bhutanese side in SAFF women’s history.Nepal had found success each time in their previous four SAFF meetings, scoring a total of 23 goals and conceding none. In the 2022 edition, Nepal had thumped Bhutan 4-0.It is also the first time Nepal have failed to score against Bhutan in the SAFF Women’s Championship.For Bhutan, it was their historic draw against Nepal in their women’s football history.Nepal, who are bidding to win their maiden SAFF crown after falling agonisingly short in previous five finals, were clear favourites and put Bhutan under pressure throughout the game but could not pierce a solid Bhutanese defence.Sabitra Bhandari, who is in France with En Avant Guingamp, missed the match after her club refused to release her before the FIFA Women’s International window which begins on Monday. Bhandari alone had 10 goals against Bhutan.Her presence was sorely missed as Nepal found several chances in the first half but could not capitalise on them.Saru Limbu had a golden opportunity to give Nepal the lead from open chance in the 26th minute after Preeti Rai set her up with a clever through ball but Limbu flashed wide.Nepal also found a series of chances inside the opposition box in the 40th but the Bhutanese defence line was so stubborn to foil every Nepali attacking effort.Nepal coach Rajendra Tamang threw in Rekha Paudel and Dipa Shahi in place of Limbu and Renuka Nagarkoti in the second half to give Nepal more attacking dynamics.Paudel’s presence was immediately felt as she troubled Bhutan defence line and goalkeeper Sangita Monger with her smooth display. Paudel, who plays for Abu Dhabi Country Club, reached close to scoring quickly after the restart when she ran into a cross from Sabita Rana Magar inside the six-yard box.Paudel also threatened the Bhutan box in the 52nd minute with her incredible first-time shot off a corner but Bhutan captain and goalkeeper Monger denied Paudel’s effort with a brilliant save.Paudel also had a clean chance in the 59th minute when Dipa Shahi fed her just outside the six-yard box but the forward shot directly at the goalkeeper.However, Limbu’s substitution and substitution of Dipa Shahi after 71 minutes due to an injury left Nepali midfield clueless.Coach Tamang also brought in Anita Basnet and Anita KC in search of goals but Nepal could not break a disciplined Bhutan defence.Rana Magar had a last ditch effort in stoppage time but her long-range shot hit the post.Earlier, Sri Lanka defeated the Maldives 1-0 to collect three points, thanks to a 17th minute header from WMK Imesha.Nepal next play the Maldives on Monday. \nDipendra Singh Airee put up an all-round display as Nepal defeated the United States by 17 runs in the first T20I at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Friday.Invited to bat first after losing the toss, Nepal posted 164-9 from their 20 overs after openers Anil Sah and Aasif Sheikh, captain Rohit Paudel and Airee all shone with the bat.Sah and Sheikh added 48 runs for the opening wicket before skipper Paudel exploited a fine start to the innings by smashing 49 runs off 33 balls. He also shared a crucial 66-run stand with Airee, who made 28 runs off 17 balls, for the fifth wicket.Harmeet Singh, Saurabh Netravalkar and Jasdeep Singh picked two wickets each for the hosts.In reply, Karan KC and Rijan Dhakal struck early to dismiss both US openers Saiteja Mukkamalla (2) and captain Monank Patel (3). Andries Gous scored 30 off 25 balls and tried to rebuild the innings but the hosts found themselves in deep trouble at 56-4 half-way into the game when Gulsan Jha had Gous caught by Sah in the 10.1 overs.Airee then dispatched Milind Kumar for 22 to halt US progress.Shayen Jahangir resisted Nepali bowling attack and lifted the chase with a half-century but Airee hit back removing Harmeet Singh for a duck and Jasdeep Singh for 16 to restrict the hosts to 147-7.Jahangir was unconquered on 60 off 34 balls.Nepal lead the three-match T20I series 1-0.The two sides play the second T20I on Sunday. \nFive-time champions India launched their SAFF Women’s Championship campaign with a 5-2 victory over Pakistan at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Thursday.Grace Dangmei scored a brace for India, while Manisha Kalyan, Bala Devi Ngangom and Jyoti Chouhan were also on target.Suha Hirani and Kayla Siddiqi scored for Pakistan.India, who are looking to reclaim the SAFF throne after losing it to Bangladesh in 2022, made their intent clear with a powerful display.India took the lead in the 5th minute through Dangmei, who received a low cross from Ranjana Chanu at the edge of the area and rocketed a powerful shot into the back of the net.Kalyan doubled India’s lead in the 17th minute with a superb finish after running into a through pass from Bala Devi.Bala Devi then added India’s third in the 35th minute, smashing an indirect freekick into the top corner.Grace added her individual second seven minutes later with a tight-angled half-volley after Pakistan’s backline failed to clear a cross from Chanu.Pakistan went into the break reducing the deficit to 4-1 from a penalty kick, which was awarded to them after Ashalata Devi brought down Nadia Khan inside the box in the first half injury time. Hirani stepped up and gave India goalkeeper Elangbam Panthoi no chance.The Pakistani were a completely different side after the break and reduced India’s advantage quickly after the restart when Siddiqi found Rameen Fareed’s deflected attempt just outside the six yard box and sent it into the bottom corner.The second goal instilled a sense of an improbable fightback into Pakistan and went close to scoring twice after the hour mark, with Zahmena Malik finding an open chance from close range in the 60th and Amina reaching close to scoring from open play four minutes later. But Pakistan lacked clinical touch and missed both opportunities.Chouhan then punished Pakistan adding their winning goal in the 78th heading in a corner from Dalima Chhibber.India play Bangladesh in their next Group A game on Wednesday.

A 14-year long painful wait for a maiden SAFF trophy. Will Nepal be able to break the title jinx this time?“Our goal is the SAFF championship title,” Nepal captain Anjila Tumbapo Subba said on the eve of the tournament. “Our team is fit and balanced…we are ready.”Nepal begin their bid for a maiden SAFF Women’s Championship title and their first ever major international trophy against Bhutan on Friday.Nepal have played 11 finals in the last two and half decades and have won none.Nepal have been drawn alongside Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka in Group B. They take on the Maldives in their next group match on Monday before wrapping up the group stage by facing Sri Lanka on Thursday.Coach Rajendra Tamang’s side will be backed by home support once again—like the last two editions (2019 and 2022)—and will enter the competition as favourites.But the task will not be easy.Until 2019, India were the sole dominant force in South Asian women’s football, having won all the first five editions.However, their supremacy in the region came to a brutal end in 2022 when Bangladesh won the title for the first time. India were also beaten 3-0 by Bangladesh in the group stage.Nepal were the finalists and were largely tipped to win the championship after knocking out India in the semi-finals but their woes continued when they lost the final 3-1 to Bangladesh.On paper, these three sides (Nepal, India and Bangladesh) will be the top contenders again.India will look to reclaim the throne they lost two years ago, while Bangladesh will aim to assert themselves as the new powerhouse by winning a second straight title. For Nepal, the opportunity to win a first title is back at home again but they will first need to overcome the challenges of superpowers India and defending champions Bangladesh.“We have played a lot of finals but have not won any. It’s time for the players to step up and motivate themselves to break the jinx,” said coach Tamang, adding that they had been training with complete focus on the trophy despite a short preparation period.“We only had two weeks of training because of the ANFA Women’s League. It would have helped a lot if we were given the opportunity to play a number of international friendlies prior to the tournament.”“But, despite the setbacks, we have prepared well,” added Tamang.Nepal’s star forward Sabitra Bhandari is set to miss at least one match due to her engagement with French Club En Avant Guingamp. \nExpressing gratitude to the people who have congratulated her on her Nobel Prize, Han Kang, this year’s Nobel laureate in literature, spoke publicly for the first time in Korea Thursday at the 18th Pony Chung Innovation Award ceremony held at the Pony Chung Hall in Seoul.“The past week will be remembered as a deeply moving experience,” Han said, adding, “As always, I hope to continue meeting readers through my books.”Han was named the recipient of the Pony Chung Innovation Award before the Nobel announcement, in recognition of her profound exploration of the human psyche and evocative emotional expressions that have resonated with readers worldwide. She is the first Korean author to win both the British International Booker Prize, in 2016 for “Vegetarian,” and France’s Prix Medicis, in 2023 for “We Do Not Part.”Apart from a brief interview with the Swedish public broadcaster SVT and a short statement issued via her Korean publishers on Oct. 11, Han has largely avoided the media.HDC Group chairman and Pony Chung Foundation founder Chung Mong-gyu, as well as Park Young-ja, wife of the late Chung Se-yung, the second chairman of HDC Group, were among those attending the award ceremony.Reflecting on her Nobel win, Han said, “When I first received the call from the Nobel Committee, it didn’t feel real. I simply tried to remain calm. It wasn’t until I saw the news reports that the gravity of the moment sank in.”Han said she celebrated the evening privately.“The past week, with so many people celebrating as if it were their own achievement, will remain a particularly special memory for me,” she said.Han also extended thanks to those who have expressed concerns about quietude in her personal life after the Nobel prize.“I hope my life doesn’t change too drastically. I have always connected with the world through my writing, and I want to continue meeting readers in that way.”Han said that she is currently working on a novella she started earlier this year. While she hopes to publish it in the first half of next year, she admitted it’s hard to predict when she will finish.Looking back on her 30-year career, Han reflected on the simplicity of her daily life: “I don’t drink, and recently, I’ve even given up coffee for health reasons. I rarely travel. Sometimes, people ask me what I do for fun.”She said she enjoys walking, reading books she hasn’t yet gotten to and spending time with her family and close friends.“What I love the most is the time I spend turning over ideas for my next novel that I have in mind,” said Han. “I often lose my way while writing a novel, surprised by the unexpected turns. But the satisfaction of reaching the end after a long detour is immense.”Han, who will turn 54 next month, remarked on the conventional wisdom that an author’s golden years are between 50 and 60.“If that’s true, I have six years left,” she said.“Though some authors remain active into their 70s or 80s, it takes a good deal of luck. For now, I want to focus on completing the three books I have in mind, with patience and perseverance, while balancing the rest of my life.”Han thanked her readers, the literary community and those who have supported the publishing industry through difficult times.The Pony Chung Foundation, established in 2005 in memory of the late Chung Se-yung, former honorary chairman of HDC Group, supports a wide range of initiatives in the humanities.Past recipients include director Hwang Dong-hyuk of “Squid Game,” pianist Cho Seong-jin and former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The award carries a cash prize of 200 million won ($146,000).-In association with Asia News Network \nGunmen killed a Mozambique opposition lawyer and a party official after firing multiple rounds at a car in which they were travelling on Saturday, rights groups said, ratcheting up tensions ahead of protests against a disputed election result.New opposition party Podemos and its presidential aspirant Venancio Mondlane reject provisional results showing a likely win for Frelimo - the party that has ruled Mozambique for half a century - and its candidate Daniel Chapo.They have called for a nationwide strike on Monday.Mozambican civil society election observer group More Integrity said the attack happened in the Bairro Da Coop neighbourhood of the capital Maputo, killing Podemos lawyer Elvino Dias and party representative Paulo Guambe.Human Rights Watch and Mozambique’s Center for Democracy and Human Rights (CDD) also issued statements confirming the attack.“They were brutally assassinated (in a) cold-blooded murder,” Adriano Nuvunga, CDD director, told Reuters by telephone.“The indications that around 10 to 15 bullets were shot, and they died instantly,” he added, describing it as a “message” to opposition protesters planning to convene on Monday.The European Union and Mozambique’s former colonial ruler Portugal condemned the killing and called for an investigation.Later, in the evening, Frelimo’s candidate Chapo condemned the attack as an “affront to the principles of ...democracy that we must all defend”.Mondlane’s rise to become Mozambique’s main challenger was a threat to Frelimo, but also to the former official opposition party Renamo - once a rebel outfit backed by racist white regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) during the Cold War.Alex Vines, Africa programme director at London-based international affairs think tank Chatham House, called the killing a “serious escalation” that raised tensions ahead of Monday’s strike.Western observers have cast doubt on the credibility of the poll, noting reports of vote buying, intimidation, inflated voter rolls and poor transparency in collation - problems that have marred most polls since Frelimo introduced democracy in 1994 after two decades in power.Full results are expected on October 24, but many fear Monday’s protest could turn bloody. Mozambique’s security forces have opened fire on protesters, including after last year’s local elections, rights groups say. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nNepal's ancient practice of worshipping young girls as Kumaris has evolved, with Matina Shakya's reign (2008-2017) marking significant changes in education, healthcare, and social integration for both current and former Kumaris.\nJuddha Shumsher Rana's zoo in 1932 housed various animals, including tigers, rhinoceroses, hippos, red pandas, peacocks, pheasants, Himalayan monals, monkeys, bears, deer, and even a lion.\nUnauthorized translations, including Taslima Nasrin's Nepali books, thrive in Nepal due to the absence of proper regulations, underpaying copyright holders, and hurting the industry and readers with poor quality translations.\nThe United Nations has faced chronic failures in preventing conflicts, with its Security Council's structure and veto power hindering its ability to maintain international peace, and resolutions often ignored, undermining the organization's effectiveness and relevance, despite its shortcomings being a reflection of structural deficiencies rather than irrelevance.\nEdited volumes in social sciences (articles or previously published) advance knowledge by providing thematic coherence, introductions, and inter-article references, while readers compile pre-existing articles on specific topics, and both are crucial for academic scholarship and research.\nIn Nepal's Karnali Province, apple farmers face transportation challenges despite increased production, leading to losses and income disparity due to poor roads, lack of storage facilities, and exploitative middlemen.\nThe episode of Bhatbhateni supermarket chain owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land and announcing plans to build the head office of the ruling CPN-UML is dubious on multiple fronts. More than anything else, it has again exposed how Nepal’s politicians, political parties and businesspeople work in collusion for mutual benefit. There is nothing inherently wrong with politicians and businesspersons cooperating, for instance to create a business- and investment-friendly climate. But any initiative the government or the country’s major political parties take should be in the interest of the society, and not unduly favour any particular group or person. But what we see is that most collaborations between politicians and businessmen in Nepal invariably benefit vested interests. The deal between CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner has raised various questions. First, the way the party central secretariat took the decision looks suspicious. Though Oli convened a meeting to get the proposal endorsed by the party committee, even the party’s office bearers were reportedly kept in dark about the details and exact plans. Oli is not only the chief of a major political force but also the country’s prime minister. Even a layman can easily infer that Gurung, the businessman, didn’t make such a huge investment out of generosity. Another concerning thing about the Oli-Gurung deal is that the prime minister openly accepted the huge donation—10 ropani and 14 ana (0.55 hectares) of land and an investment to build a highly sophisticated building—from a person who is facing multiple corruption charges and whose cases are sub judice in the court. This is tantamount to openly promoting corruption and bad governance. Oli’s action has been criticised even in the UML party. Some leaders including standing committee member Binda Pandey have publicly criticised the deal and have demanded that the party correct it. They have admirably mustered courage to speak against the wrong of Oli, the party’s all-powerful chair, even when they know that he tends to take such criticism personally. If the past is any guide, such critics of Oli tend to be systematically sidelined in the party. This is not a one-off act by the chief of a major political party. It is an open secret that major parties give election tickets to businesspersons in return for financial help of various kinds. There is one thing common between Sher Bahadur Deuba of Nepali Congress, UML’s Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre): all of them have over the years sought the help of controversial businessmen to prop up their parties or even their own factions within the parties. Oli is yet to offer a convincing reason for why accepting the donation was right. The occupant of the highest office in the land cannot act with such abandon, with seemingly no sense of accountability towards the people, or even towards his own party cadres. Oli has always been known as someone who is headstrong and not afraid even to shield goons if it serves his interest. He hasn’t changed much. Meanwhile, the public’s delusion with the old political establishment continues to grow.     \nDespite progress in reducing maternal mortality rates in Nepal, the rate has plateaued, with many women still dying during childbirth due to a lack of skilled birth attendants, inadequate infrastructure, and a failure to empower marginalized communities.\nNepalis with disabilities face the daily ordeal of navigating cities that are not built for them. Whenever roads and sidewalks are built or expanded, the disabled community harbours hope of easier mobility. However, the authorities either overlook the accessibility for such people or carelessly build structures that are supposed to assist them. This renders people not only disabled by their conditions but also by infrastructural shortcomings. According to the National Census 2021, 2.2 percent of Nepal’s population has some form of disability; 2.5 percent of males and 2 percent of females have a disability. The country ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in December 2009. Moreover, the provisions in the Disability Rights Act ensure accessibility to physical infrastructure. Although Nepal has a progressive policy on the rights of people with disabilities, the implementation part has been lagging. An audit published by the National Federation of the Disabled-Nepal on 150 public infrastructure sites in Kathmandu showed that no samples were completely accessible: 132 samples were found “not accessible”, while the rest were “partially accessible”. In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs 50 million for disabled-friendly pavements and even completed the first phase, a 1.5km stretch from Putalisadak to Thapathali. Although this is commendable, these supposedly disabled-friendly pavements need routine monitoring, as most of the tactile pavings built earlier ended abruptly or led to electricity poles, trees, walls or drains. Generalising disabilities and offering solutions that only cater to a specific group is also problematic. Most of the time, the authorities build tactile paving and label the area disability-friendly. However, problems of people with other forms of physical and intellectual disability—such as lack of tactile or audio indicators at zebra crossings, narrow sidewalks and absence of ramps—remain unaddressed.Although road accidents occasionally make headlines, accidents involving people with disabilities rarely get noticed. Many unreported cases involve people with disabilities falling into rivers or drains, collisions with poles or trees due to ineffective tactile blocks, and hit-and-run cases while crossing roads. These accidents can be avoided if basic assistance like railings, ramps, audio and tactile indicators, etc are ensured. In many instances, these problems arise not from the lack of disability-friendly infrastructures but from the general mismanagement and poor condition of public infrastructures. Potholes are a common sight on older roads and even some newer ones in Kathmandu. With the city’s rapid urbanisation, construction is happening every few metres. Building materials are often placed on sidewalks that are already narrow, leaving pedestrians with no choice but to walk on the roads. This poses a risk for everyone and could be perilous for people with disabilities. Moreover, the roads that seem perfectly fine the previous day are under maintenance the next day. The authorities do not consider providing an alternative disability-friendly route. Even the signs that inform of the situation of the roads ahead are ineffective. Doing the bare minimum to check the inclusivity list is not an option. Many government office buildings in Nepal are not disability-friendly, and the same applies to institutions like schools and universities. This is also due to the lack of proper budget, as disabled-friendly infrastructures are often not prioritised, depriving a significant and capable portion of the population of their fundamental rights. The government must ensure that people with disabilities have the rights that are promised in the constitution. As for our part as citizens, we must abandon our primitive mindset and be more inclusive of people with disabilities in our thoughts and actions. It’s time we realise that an inclusive nation leaves no one behind as it progresses.  \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nOn Sunday, the country is likely to experience partly to generally cloudy weather in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces, including the hilly regions of the other provinces.In contrast, the remaining parts of the country are expected to see partly cloudy to mainly fair conditions.The Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, in a few places across Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces, as well as in the hilly areas of the rest of the country.The weather pattern is expected to continue into tonight, with similar conditions forecast.
