Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe debut edition of the Nepal Premier League Twenty20 cricket tournament is set to kick off on Saturday with a festive atmosphere and with so much anticipation that it could write a new chapter in Nepali cricket.Billed as the ‘Festival of Himalayas’, the NPL has already attracted global interest, with the likes of former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan and New Zealand allrounder James Neesham, among other big cricketing names, set to light up the eight-team competition that will run until December 21.The involvement of Star Sports Network—a group of Indian television sports channels that also holds the rights of flagship tournaments like Indian Premier League, English Premier League, Wimbledon and ICC events—as the official broadcasting partner will now give the league a worldwide exposure.Partnership with Twenty-first Century Media (TCM) Sports—a sports management company that has managed Cricket World Cups, Asia Cups, IPL and other international events—is further evidence that the NPL aspires to evolve into one of the major cricketing events in the world.Organiser Cricket Association of Nepal appears determined to make the league a landmark event, aiming to propel Nepali cricket into an unprecedented era of growth and global recognition.“The organisation of the NPL is itself a big achievement for CAN and Nepali cricket,” CAN Spokesperson Chhumbi Lama told the Post.“For the first time, our domestic tournament will be broadcast worldwide, making the NPL the ideal platform to elevate Nepali cricket to the international stage,” Lama added. “The inaugural league could be a catalyst for Nepali cricket’s golden era.”CAN has laid out ambitious plans to expand the league in future editions, including multi-venue matches, games under floodlights, and a potential home-and-away format within five years.“This year, the NPL will be hosted at TU Cricket Ground, but as eight cricket stadiums are currently under construction, we plan to expand to cities outside the Kathmandu Valley,” Lama said. “If floodlights are installed at TU Ground, the future matches will be even more spectacular.”CAN has also developed a comprehensive business strategy to ensure the league’s sustainability, with goals to attract government investment and international grants.“This will take Nepali cricket into a commercial era, paving the way for further development of the game,” Lama added. CAN is making another effort to establish its own franchise league in the country following a debacle of its previous venture. It had organised Nepal T20 League in the 2022/23 season but the tournament proved a disaster as it was overshadowed by spot-fixing allegations, resulting in the involvement of Central Investigation Bureau and several arrests.CAN also faced criticisms for its mismanagement, negligence and incompetence. Eventually, the contract with Seven3Sports, to which the tournament rights were sold for eight years without a competitive bidding process, had to be terminated.This time, CAN, in its renewed effort to establish a successful franchise cricket league, seems committed to implementing stringent measures to safeguard the integrity of the NPL.Retired AIG Ishwor Babu Karki, who is the Head of Integrity at CAN and oversees anti-corruption, safeguarding, security and anti-doping for the cricket governing body, will lead the oversight unit during the NPL.“We have taken previous mistakes as a lesson. The NPL will be fair,” said Lama.“Karki will oversee the integrity of the NPL. CAN has also coordinated with all the concerned departments to make sure things comply with the ICC protocol,” he added.“CAN wants to assure that the league will be without any controversy.”The NPL—which is building on the foundation laid by earlier tournaments like Everest Premier League, Dhangadhi Premier League and Pokhara Premier League—is also positioning itself as a game-changer for domestic cricket, with the promise of becoming a vital financial lifeline for domestic players.A major highlight is the league’s title sponsorship deal with Siddhartha Bank Limited, which is being hailed as the largest sponsorship agreement in Nepali sports history. However, the exact figures of the agreement have not been disclosed.Eight franchise teams—Biratnagar Kings, Chitwan Rhinos, Janakpur Bolts, Karnali Yaks, Kathmandu Gurkhas, Lumbini Lions, Pokhara Avengers and Sudurpaschim Royals—collectively spent more than Rs50 million rupees in the auction. They secured marquee players for 2 million each, while the players graded into A B and C categories were auctioned at base prices ranging from Rs20,000 to Rs1.5 million.The big investment underscores the league’s ambition to redefine the profile of cricket in Nepal and provide robust financial support to domestic players.While CAN provides monthly incentives to national players, NPL offers a new pathway for many domestic cricketers to build sustainable careers within the country. The tournament will nurture the next generation of cricketing talent by offering them a platform to showcase their skills and catch the attention of national selectors. Each franchise has identified a local iconic player through talent hunts, further strengthening the grassroots impact of the league.“The NPL will be a big support to domestic cricketers,” Lama said. “The players are very motivated by the initiative. It also lays the ground for grassroots cricket development as the teams have conducted talent hunts in the provinces they represent. And the exciting participation of hundreds of teenagers in the hunts is further evidence of the game’s popularity.”In addition to spotlighting emerging players, the NPL offers national cricketers a global stage to showcase their abilities.“The NPL provides an opportunity for national and domestic players to share the field with foreign professionals and world’s best cricketers. This will help them learn, grow, and improve as cricketers,\" said former national player Sharad Vesawkar, who will represent Chitwan Rhinos in the NPL.Vesawkar also emphasised how the league will help highlight Nepali talent to the world while providing a financial boost to local players aspiring to build careers in cricket. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba has reached Chengdu, China, on Thursday to lay the groundwork for the visit of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.This marks Deuba’s first visit to China since her appointment as foreign minister. The visit is expected to set the tone for the prime minister’s upcoming trip, which is being keenly watched by different sectors and stakeholders, both domestic and international.During her visit, Minister Deuba is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Chengdu in Sichuan Province, on Friday. Prime Minister Oli is visiting the northern neighbour next week at the head of an 87-member delegation, which will include 39 members from the government and 48 from the private sector. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s China visit.The prime minister’s delegation includes his spouse Radhika Shakya, Foreign Minister Deuba, two advisers to the prime minister, the prime minister’s private doctor, chief secretary, foreign and finance secretaries, security personnel, senior government officials and chief of protocol of the foreign ministry, media persons and nine lawmakers from different political parties, according to a minister. The delegation will also include the chief executive officer of the Nepal Investment Board and officials from Madan Bhandari Science and Technology University. The prime minister will fly directly to Beijing on a chartered flight of Himalaya Airlines on December 2. Foreign Minister Deuba is expected to return to Nepal on Saturday and will join the prime minister’s delegation on Monday, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Nepali Ambassador to China Krishna Prasad Oli, charge d'affaires at the Nepali Embassy in Beijing Surendra Yadav, among others, will accompany her at the meeting with Wang. During the meeting, Deuba will convey to Wang the message of the Oli-led coalition government and Nepal’s revised proposal for implementing projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Oli will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on December 3, as per the itinerary. Speaking with the Post before heading for Chengdu, Deuba said she will discuss and exchange the agenda of Oli’s upcoming China visit and will update China on Nepal’s latest position on the BRI implementation plan, which has been revised and named as ‘Framework for cooperation on jointly building the BRI between Nepal and China’. Beijing had proposed the plan in early 2020.A joint Congress-UML taskforce has heavily revised the text of the document and sent it for Chinese approval. The new text of the cooperation framework, which was reviewed and approved by Prime Minister Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, was sent to the Chinese side on Wednesday for their consideration. With this, real negotiations on BRI have begun between Nepal and China, after four years. Although the Chinese side is not happy with excessive media reporting and hype around the BRI in Nepal, the narrowing of the scope of cooperation compared to the original Chinese proposal, and the spread of misinformation and disinformation by various sections about the BRI, the Chinese have not outright rejected the revised text, according to ruling party leaders. The leaders said efforts are underway to address Chinese concerns. A joint team of Congress and UML leaders met on Thursday evening to explore ways to reassure the Chinese side. “Our central message is, Nepal is committed to the BRI, of which we became a part in 2017. We want Chinese economic and technical support in order to expedite the projects under the BRI framework, and Nepal won’t backtrack on its position on the BRI,” a Nepali Congress leader told the Post.The taskforce has heavily revised the draft of the BRI implementation plan, to the dissatisfaction of the Chinese side.Chinese Ambassador Chen Song had expressed his displeasure about “biased media coverage on the BRI and statements made by political party leaders” during a meeting with Foreign Minister Deuba on Sunday.Foreign Minister Deuba rebutted claims of divisions between the Congress and the UML on the BRI.“Our leaders are one and firm on the BRI. There is no difference between us. We have also formed a team to pursue the issue of BRI and they are also talking with them [Chinese]… We have no disagreements over it [BRI]”, said Deuba.Asked whether an agreement on the BRI would materialise during the prime minister’s visit, Deuba stated that it is part of negotiations.“In diplomacy and foreign policy, when matters of bilateral relations arise, it is natural for both sides to present their respective positions. Several rounds of talks and negotiations are held in such cases. Let’s see how things unfold,” said Deuba without giving an explicit answer on whether a new agreement on BRI would be signed during Oli’s visit. During her meeting with Wang, Deuba will discuss overall agendas of the prime minister’s visit, Nepal’s expectations, and quick realisation of commitments from past high-level engagements.The new draft of the MoU on BRI cooperation framework focuses on Nepal’s current needs.“The Chinese had in early 2020 proposed the plan’s original text, which has been substantially revised, and our commitment to the BRI is well reflected in the new text,” said a task-force member on condition of anonymity because the matter is still evolving and in stage of negotiation with the Chinese side. “There is no need to include every detail or ambiguous language in the agreement that could lead to multiple interpretations. We want to see BRI as a development cooperation vehicle that will focus on projects related to connectivity, infrastructure and energy,” the member said. Officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that if the Chinese side agrees to Nepal’s terms and conditions, a new framework for cooperation could be signed during Oli’s visit.While the new text is silent on loans from Chinese banks and financial institutions for BRI projects, it emphasises Nepal's preference for grants, at least for now. The aim during the prime minister’s visit is to reach an agreement to expedite BRI projects. Nepal had initially proposed 35 projects under the BRI in 2018, but later trimmed down the list to nine at China’s request.Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa; chief political adviser to the prime minister, Bishnu Rimal; economic adviser to the prime minister, Yuba Raj Khatiwada; and advocate Semnata Dahal revised the original document proposed by China.As the prime minister prepares to visit the northern neighbour on December 2, the BRI has come into sharp focus. Various quarters are keenly watching how Nepal will negotiate the BRI deal with China. The two ruling coalition partners—the Congress and the UML—have been holding continuous negotiations to forge a common position and finalise Nepal’s stance on the support it seeks from China. If we can convince the Chinese side that Nepal is committed to the BRI and ready to execute some projects under its framework, it would serve as a positive outcome for Beijing, Kathmandu, Prime Minister Oli, the Nepali Congress and the UML, said the party leaders who are part of the negotiations.They added that a big country like China would respect and understand Nepal’s sensitivities and geopolitical location. \nAlthough abortion was legalised in Nepal in 2002, unsafe abortions are still rampant in many places throughout the country, and women are denied services, a new report shows.According to the report prepared by Center for Research on Environment Health and Population Activities (CREHPA), and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), one in 10 women seeking abortions at health facilities was denied care. Moreover, four in 10 women (42 percent) with more than 10 weeks of pregnancy or who were unaware of their gestational age were denied an abortion. “The most common reason for denial was advanced gestation age, with over 80 percent of denials attributed to this factor,” reads the report. “Denial doesn’t stop abortion; it drives women to seek alternatives. Sixty percent of women who were denied services by authorised health facilities attempted to end their pregnancies elsewhere.”Nepal legalised abortion in 2002, marking a milestone for women’s reproductive rights, their empowerment, and bodily autonomy. With legalisation, persecution and jail terms for women who terminated unwanted pregnancies ended, and unsafe abortions decreased significantly.However, the new report shows a vast gap in services, which forced women to opt for alternatives, including unsafe means.“Thirty-eight percent of women who were denied services turned to unsafe/unapproved sites for subsequent abortions,” the report stated. “Seventy-three percent of women who were denied abortion services were, in fact, legally eligible for abortion.”Access to abortion services varied based on women’s characteristics. Those under the age of 25 years, unmarried, childless, not working outside the home, of lower wealth, or seeking abortion solely for sex selection were more likely to be denied abortion. Additionally, women who were unaware of the legal status of abortion services also experienced higher rates of denial.The study was carried out on 1,841 women seeking abortion services from 22 government-approved health facilities in all seven provinces, including major cities—Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Chitwan, Butwal, Nepalgunj Kailali, Kanchanpur, Biratnagar, Jhapa among others.‘This study shows that progressive abortion laws alone are not enough to guarantee access to safe abortion for all women,” said Dr Mahesh Puri, principal investigator of the study. “Young women, those with lower educational backgrounds, and women from marginalised groups (such as the Dalit) are disproportionately affected by denials, perpetuating cycles of poverty and poor health.”Women who were denied abortion care reported substantial economic hardship, with increased rates of inadequate household income and lower labour force participation over the period of three years, according to the report.Women who are unable to receive abortion services were also less likely to achieve their personal goals. While 42 percent of women who received an abortion achieved education goals, only 31 percent of denied women did so. Similar disparities were seen in employment (54 percent vs 45 percent), child-related goals (65 percent vs 31 percent), and financial goals (66 percent vs 50 percent).Denying abortion care doesn’t only affect women; it has lasting consequences for the health of their children, according to the report. The report highlights the urgent need for targeted policies to bridge the gap between Nepal’s legal framework and the reality of service accessibility.“Ensuring that abortion services are universally accessible and affordable can help reduce economic and health disparities among Nepalese women and contribute to better outcomes for children,” reads the report.Experts say unsafe abortion is among the leading factors of maternal deaths. The study does not say anything about maternal deaths from unsafe abortions. Still, the latest census report by the National Statistics Office shows that of the total maternal deaths, six percent (37 women) had undergone abortions or suffered a miscarriage.. It is estimated that over 300,000 abortions are performed in Nepal in a year. However, the government data show only around 100,000 abortions are performed in a year at authorised health facilities. Experts say many abortion take place in unauthorised places too, which does not come into the government’s record. \nFarmer Bhirikhan Mandal in north Jhitakaiya, Bara, brought diammonium phosphate at Rs70 per kg to apply on his wheat farm. The subsidised rate is Rs45 per kg and is available only through government-designated cooperatives.“We don’t get fertiliser from the cooperative when we need it the most,” said Mandal. “We are forced to buy smuggled fertiliser openly available in the market paying higher rates.”He said that applying DAP is a must after sowing the wheat.Fertiliser shortage for winter crops could spell more trouble for most farmers, who have seen a reduced output of summer crop, mostly paddy, as a result of heavy rainfall in late September.Jagarnath Mandal, another farmer, also purchased the fertiliser at the same price as Bhirkhan. He said the fertiliser that the government provides to cooperatives in quotas is being sold in the market openly. Prithvi Sah, a senior farmer of Kalikamai rural municipality, Parsa, said the Divya Saving and Credit Cooperative received 60 bags of state-subsidised DAP through a quota system. Still, most of the farmers could not get it.“Unable to access fertiliser, most farmers are unable to sow wheat this winter. We are compelled to go to India to buy DAP,” said Sah.Saharom Raut, a farmer leader from Jagarnathpur, Parsa, said fertiliser scarcity was caused by the Agriculture Inputs Company and the Salt Trading Corporation, the agencies responsible for importing and distributing vital farm inputs, as they supplied only small quantities to the cooperatives that distribute them.“Cooperatives have been distributing fertilisers to their near and dear ones. In India, we get DAP bags weighing 45 kg at IRs3,000 whereas the actual weight would be 50 kg per bag,” said Raut.Asarfi Sah, former Parsa president of the Nepal Farmers Association, said there is a massive scarcity of DAP in the district. “Wheat sowing is being delayed due to fertiliser scarcity. Not all farmers can go across the border to India to buy fertiliser.”Known as the country’s food basket, farmers in the Tarai/Madhesh who were supposed to finish planting winter crops within mid-December could not do so due to fertiliser scarcity.Farmers are facing fertiliser scarcity for sowing wheat, pulses, lentils, and mustard, among other winter crops. Agriculture Inputs Company and Salt Trading Corporation have started distributing fertiliser from ‘buffer stock’ as their DAP stock has already run out.Purushottam Singh, information chief at the provincial office of Agriculture Inputs Company, Birgunj, said they have started distributing DAP from the buffer stock for a week. “We have already distributed 1,000 tonnes of DAP out of 3,500 tonnes in stock. We’ve heard that it will take 15 more days for the DAP to arrive from Kolkata.”Aditya Birla Company won the global tender to supply fertiliser in Nepal. The supplier will bring 25,000 tonnes of DAP to Nepal from a third country via the Kolkata dry port, said Singh.“It will take a week and a half more to arrive in Nepal after packaging in the Kolkata dry port,” said Singh. Out of the 25,000 tonnes, 26 percent will arrive at the Birgunj office. Amoj Lamichhane, chief of the Salt Trading Corporation's Birgunj provincial office, said the corporation is preparing to distribute the 320 tonnes of DAP in buffer stock to the cooperatives. “We have DAP in limited stock. Since it’s buffer stock, we are waiting for the agriculture ministry’s consent to distribute it.”Lamichhane said that 25,000 tonnes of DAP imported by the corporation will take a month to arrive. Aditya Birla is the consignment supplier.The shortage has hit farmers in western Nepal too. Shailendra Pandey of Amawa, Marchawar rural municipality-2, has been unable to sow wheat on his 4-bigha field due to the lack of urea and DAP. “I have been asking for fertiliser since harvesting paddy but have been unable to get it. They bring small amounts of subsidised fertiliser, which is taken quickly.”“I have been waiting for fertiliser to sow wheat on my 12 kattha for weeks. I have been trying to bring them from a nearby Indian market but do not have courage as border police beat farmers,” said Santu Dhawal of Gidhaiya, Gaidhawa rural municipality-5.Dhawal said that in the Indian market, a bucket of 20 kg fertiliser costs Rs800, and his neighbour has already brought and spread it. In Kapilvastu, Ram Shankar Tharu has sown wheat on a bigha without DAP fertiliser. “I used to sow wheat on three bighas, but after not getting fertiliser on time, I had to reduce it.” The recent paddy harvest was also not good. The winter output could drop if fertiliser is still unavailable, Tharu shared his worry.For wheat only, the Agriculture Inputs Company, Taulihawa, needs 2,000 tonnes of urea and 1,000 tonnes of DAP. The company received 447 tonnes of urea and 373 tonnes of DAP, and the cooperative took its share for distribution. The company’s stock has run out.“A farmer runs his home by selling agricultural yield, but we need to rely on rainwater, and we do not get seeds and fertiliser on time,” said Janardan Baral, a leading farmer.Wheat needs fertiliser input three times. While sowing, the DAP is needed. After three weeks and two months of sowing, urea needs to be applied to the crop.In Nepalgunj, Ramesh Teli went to buy a chemical fertiliser but had to return empty-handed. His nine-member family depends on farming income. “I would have already sown wheat if fertiliser was available,” he said, who grows mustard and wheat on 12 katthas.The Agriculture Inputs Company, Nepalgunj, has a small stock of DAP. It is unable to provide the quantity sought by farmers.Agriculture Inputs Company, Nepalgunj, demanded 6,000 tonnes of urea, 2,500 tonnes of DAP, and 300 tonnes of potash but received only 4,020 tonnes of urea, 685 tonnes of DAP, and 75 tonnes of potash, said Puspharaj Shrestha, the company's branch manager.According to the provincial office of Agriculture Inputs Company, Bhairahawa, it has 11,644 tonnes of urea, 2,557 tonnes of DAP, and 55 tonnes of potash. The company supplies fertiliser to Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, and two districts of Gandaki.In Sudurpashim Province, though there is no fertiliser shortage, the cooperatives have not been able to meet the demand.Kanchanpur received 4,000 tonnes of DAP and 5,500 tonnes of urea, which did not fulfil the district's demand. Wheat farming is done on 35,000 hectares in Sudurpashim.(With inputs from Shankar Acharya in Parsa, Sanju Paudel in Lumbini, Manoj Paudel in Kapilvastu, Rupa Gahatraj in Nepalgunj and Bhawani Bhatta in Kanchanpur) \nNepal suffered a 55-run defeat against Sri Lanka in their opening match of the U-19 Asia Cup at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium in the United Arab Emirates on Friday.Needing 234 for victory, Nepal U-19 team faltered against Sri Lanka’s disciplined bowling attack and were all out for 178 in 46.2 overs despite a half century from Mayen Yadav.Nepal made a fine start to their chase, with openers Aakash Tripathi and Mayen adding 39 runs for the opening stand.However, Tripathi’s dismissal for 19 in the 11th over started a collapse, with Arjun Kumal (12), Santosh Yadav (10) also departing soon.Mayan Yadav played a 62-ball knock facing 91 deliveries to take Nepal past 100 total after 29.2 overs but his removal by Praveen Maneesha (trapped lbw) left Nepal helpless.Mayen hit three fours and two sixes.Roshan Bishwakarma (5), Naren Bhatta (12) also departed soon.Uttam Magar (17) and Naren Saud (16) tried to keep up with the chase but could not guide Nepal closer to the target.Earlier, Sri Lanka posted 233 from the allotted 50 overs riding on half-centuries from Sharujan Shanmuganathan and Lakvin Abeysinghe. Despite a slow start, Shanmuganathan’s 99-ball 62 and Abeysinghe 50 off 53 took them to 167-3 in 20.3 overs and when it looked like the Lankans were heading for a big total, Santosh took both dangermen Shanmuganathan and Abeysinghe to halt the opponents’ progress.Santosh, who had also dispatched Vimath Dinsara for 24, also took the wicket of Maneesha to complete an outstanding four-wicket haul (4-30).Kavija Gamage then played 37 not out to ensure Sri Lanka finish their innings with a fightable total.Nepal play their next Group B match against Bangladesh on Sunday, followed by a clash against Afghanistan on Tuesday.Bangladesh started their Asia Cup with a commanding 45-run victory over Afghanistan in Dubai.Pakistan and India open the Group A battle with a blockbuster clash on Saturday in Dubai. Hosts United Arab Emirates are against Japan in Sharjah.  \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba met her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Chengdu, China, on Friday.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a post on X that both ministers exchanged views on various aspects of Nepal-China relations and discussed matters relating to the preparation for Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's upcoming official visit.Foreign Minister Deuba left for China on Thursday at the invitation of her Chinese counterpart to lay the ground for the prime minister’s visit. This marks her first official visit to China since her appointment as minister in July.The visit comes as the Oli-led coalition government prepares to navigate Nepal’s position on the BRI. Continuous negotiations between ruling coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—are underway to finalise Nepal’s stance on development cooperation with China. The BRI remains a key area of focus for Nepal’s engagement with its northern neighbour.According to the ministry, Prime Minister Oli will pay an official visit to China from December 2 to 5 at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang. During the visit, he will hold bilateral talks with Premier Li and exchange views on matters of mutual interest.Oli is also scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China. The prime minister will deliver a keynote speech at Peking University as part of the visit. He will also address the Nepal-China Business Forum, co-hosted by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI). \nThe Ministry of Home Affairs has warned that legal action will be taken against individuals using social media to spread hateful and misleading content.In a statement issued on Friday, the ministry said that those who undermine social harmony, disrupt public peace, or violate law and order will be brought under legal scrutiny.The ministry said it is concerned over the growing misuse of social media by some individuals to circulate divisive and false expressions, which are prohibited by law.It said that spreading content that damages inter-ethnic, religious, or communal relations, incites violence, or undermines public decency and morality will be a punishable offence. \nAmid growing concerns over severe health risks faced by Nepali migrant workers, such as heart and kidney failures due to heat stress, experts have recommended a complete overhaul of health screening protocols for those heading for foreign employment. The proposed measures aim to establish a Centralised Digital Repository System (CDRS) to ensure comprehensive and high-quality health checks for workers.A specialised task force led by Dr Dipendra Raman Singh, secretary at the Ministry of Health and Populations, submitted its findings to Minister for Labour, Employment and Social Security Sharat Singh Bhandari.The team with 30 experts comprising specialists from major hospitals including the National Academy of Medical Sciences/Bir Hospital, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Patan Academy of Health Sciences, and the Sukraraj Tropical Hospital discovered significant gaps in current health screening practices.The report stresses the need for a systematic approach to prevent malpractices in medical fitness reports, pointing out that many current health checks do not meet proper standards. Shedding light on the relevance of the report, Dr Singh highlighted the dangers posed by substandard testing, explaining that it compromises worker safety. “We observed that quality health assessments are lacking, and what is currently being done does not constitute a genuine health examination,” he said.The findings also call for a thorough revision of how the causes of deaths among workers abroad are documented, as many death certificates lack detailed explanations, often citing vague terms such as “natural” or “sudden” death. The task force underscored that better tracking and recording of health data from recruitment to employment abroad could help mitigate risks and protect workers’ health.The report reveals that inadequate or inaccessible health checks lead to premature deaths among workers abroad. The Foreign Employment Board states that around 1,000 Nepali workers die annually, with a total of 14,666 deaths recorded over the past 14 years (2008-09 to 2021-22). Key causes include cardiac arrest (19 percent), natural causes (19.5 percent), workplace accidents (7 percent), road incidents (12.7 percent), and suicide (11 percent).Professor Dr Sunil Kumar Joshi, director of the Nepal Injury Research Centre and a member of the task force, pointed out the absence of adequate occupational health training for workers, leading to preventable deaths. He emphasised the importance of informing workers about industry-specific risks and preventive measures before they leave for job destinations.The report suggests that Nepal’s health institutions need to be standardised according to international guidelines, recommending a unified process to match the health checks required by labour destination countries. This could involve strengthening diplomatic efforts to align with standards in countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Malaysia, Israel, South Korea, Australia, and European nations. It also calls for better regulation and supervision of health institutions to prevent malpractices.The inspections by a team led by an under-secretary on August 29 last year uncovered severe negligence, such as conducting health checks without real examinations, using substandard labs, and preparing reports without required equipment or staff. Following these findings, the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security suspended 67 health institutions for failing to meet standards, only allowing the renewal of those that complied.The report proposes that visa centres and health testing facilities be established in regions such as Bhairahawa and Pokhara to decentralise access and align with international practices. Minister Bhandari praised the report, stating, “Health checks should not be viewed as a mere commercial activity. They are connected to the life of the workers and need to be implemented with utmost seriousness. This report will contribute significantly to enhancing our migration policies.” \nAs the world marks the 16 days of activism against gender-based violence (GBV) with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women starting November 25, it bears recalling the different forms of violence inflicted upon women and young girls and how effective these campaigns are. According to the United Nations, one in three women globally experiences physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. The reality is dire in Nepal too. The Demographic Health Survey 2022 reveals that one in three Nepali women aged 15-49 has experienced some form of violence. Further, with the rise of technology, women have been experiencing harassment, non-consensual sexting, hate and fear in online spaces. The unresolved and harrowing rape-and-murder of Nirmala Panta is an example of the pervasive and enduring nature of GBV in Nepal.Campaigns and activism hold great promise to challenge and confront the violence women face. In Nepal, the government, non-profit organisations and international agencies join hands to discuss the issues of women and find practical solutions. Yet their actions are mostly urban-centric, with rallies and programmes not reaching the grassroots level. For countless Nepali women in rural areas who face multiple layers of marginalisation, these 16 days offer little in terms of solace or change. Words don’t translate into actions even as their issues get the centre stage. Apparently, despite having abundant legal frameworks against GBV, Nepal ranks 71 out of 190 economies in the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law Safety indicator, which focuses on four key areas: child marriage, sexual harassment, domestic violence and femicide. The UN’s report “Femicides in 2023” states that “home is the most dangerous place for women”. Nepal is no exception, as out of 21,568 cases of violence against women reported between July 2021 and July 2022, 80 percent were related to domestic violence. And intimate partner violence—a subset of domestic violence—remains the most challenging issue to tackle. Meanwhile, with the rise of artificial intelligence, deepfakes of women have become common. Our outdated cyber laws fail to cover new threats against women and leave them ever-vulnerable in online spaces; Nepal remains far behind in addressing technology-facilitated gender violence. While this slow progress is partly due to the enduring severity of domestic and intimate partner violence, which demands significant attention and resources from the government and other stakeholders, it would be dangerous to overlook online forms of violence against women. For women going through physical and mental trauma brought about by various forms of violence, no lofty words pronounced at forums offer relief. Addressing such pervasive issues needs practical actions like making them capable enough to recognise and resist domestic violence. It is also vital to goad survivors to break silence about the abuse they face, as according to the 2022 health survey, 58 percent of women who experience physical and sexual violence don’t seek support or speak up. If they did speak up, it would be much easier for police and other authorities to intervene and help. Yet more can be done. Alongside designated days to counter violence against women, as many women’s rights activists emphasise, there should also be year-round advocacy on GBV. Sensitising men about violence against women and bringing—and enacting—stringent laws to dismantle the evolving structures that perpetuate gender-based violence are the bare minimum needed to build safe spaces for women. \nIn politics, timing carries a big message.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s CPN-UML staged a road show on Durbarmarg in front of the now-museum royal palace on November 22. Dubbed Jagaran Sabha, the ruling party’s unusual political rally followed the arrest of Durga Prasai, a former nominated central committee member of the UML, on the charge of making ‘baseless’ allegations against Oli that the sitting premier had huge investments in a Cambodian telecom company. Prasai, who is being investigated for cybercrime of circulating doctored documents online, once had unhindered access to the residences of Oli and his former comrade, the ex-PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal. It did not take Prasai long to harbour enmity against the two former insurgents.Prasai’s allegations do not seem to hold much water, but there are calls in the political circles already to investigate if Oli, like many top Nepali leaders fairly or unfairly facing the charges of hiding their kickbacks abroad, has wealth stashed in a safe haven.Oli’s feeble show of mass—against domestic rivals, conspirators and foreign foes alike—might be interpreted as the public no longer having an interest in chest-thumping politicians: All that matters is how much they can deliver in real terms. It was visible in the pictures that the UML workers and supporters who marched up to the rally had enormous space left to fill on the former King’s Way.Many view Rabi Lamichhane’s earlier arrest and ongoing investigation in detention for over a month now, in a case of cooperatives savings embezzlement, as a fight between old forces and his newly formed outfit that once held the potential to corner traditional parties in the next round of elections. Doing his bit to unsettle the old guard is the independent Kathmandu mayor, Balen Shah, who one day threatens to burn down Singha Durbar and, on another, slaps a hefty fine on the prime minister’s party for failing to clean up after the rally before the day is barely over.However, one thing has become amply clear: Old tricks have ceased to amuse Nepalis. They have bigger problems to tackle: Lack of jobs, ineffective healthcare, unproductive education and national humiliation caused by centuries of underdevelopment and their leaders’ shameless pomp.Nepal’s global stature appears to be diminishing despite the country’s geostrategic location. Nepali passport bearers face harassment around the world in various ways. Even in the neighbourhood, the importance accorded to the Nepali government heads is shaky. Possibly due to New Delhi’s apparent refusal to receive the new Nepal prime minister even after a top New York meeting, Oli is bound for Beijing on Monday. This, by no means, should be a China card he’s playing, as Dahal alleged recently. Nepal has its own interests to pursue, especially in the periphery. The country with a huge potential in hydropower wouldn’t have been able to sell clean energy to Bangladesh without India providing the transmission line. In the same vein, Kathmandu and Beijing have signed a mega connectivity framework to extend road, rail and communication networks. Oli’s China visit, in a break from the oft-followed tradition of Nepali prime ministers going to India first, has the signing of an agreement on President Xi Jinping’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) high on the agenda.The matter of concern for Nepalis is not where our prime minister goes first but what achievement we’ll have from our government’s engagements with our neighbours. And our neighbours should only be concerned if Kathmandu’s relations with any foreign capital harm their own national interests. Locked between two Asian giants, Nepal has no history of harming its neighbours’ broad interests, while it may have suffered immensely from their unilateral policies.Both China and India are undeniable global powers, their economic and military might forever rising. While a smaller Nepal cannot afford to antagonise one of them, it reserves all the right to grow peacefully. Nepal can partner with its neighbours only in ventures it can afford and sustain. Even if our leaders, including Oli, tried to sway Nepalis with their balloony dreams in the past, the people living without ample means have come to grips with their bitter realities.Yes, Nepalis today are deserting their country, but the vast majority of them want to build their lives and careers here in their own towns and villages. Whether more Nepalis will be frustrated to live in their country will depend on how effectively our political leadership works for the national good.Since 2015, three old politicians have been playing the musical chair of power. Once on the hot seat, they are largely consumed by their urge to defeat opponents and thus have little appetite to serve the public or national interests. They’ve primarily relied on empty rhetoric to pacify a disenchanted public, but the old tool has lost its edge. Oli’s Durbarmarg speech might have been intended to browbeat accusers and opponents and calm the segment of society getting tired of delayed delivery, but it utterly failed in its purpose. The same will be the fate of political workers who make promises but fail to keep them. On the demo day, Oli said there was no rule on which country a Nepali prime minister should visit first and that he was going to China not for a pleasure trip.A country's foreign policy is often shaped by national politics. Sometimes, outreaches are made to assure the domestic public; sometimes, the signalling goes beyond. However, a botched foreign venture not only diverts domestic attention but can also create trouble.People here will be watching what deal Oli cuts in Beijing or what concessions he’ll make to the Chinese president’s global connectivity project. The ruling Congress-UML coalition is split over how BRI projects should be funded. The official position of the Congress party is that Nepal should only accept grants to undertake such projects. Differences between Nepal and China have delayed BRI implementation even as Kathmandu signed it up in 2017. Postures from both sides will have much bearing on the Nepali sentiment that prosperity will trickle into the country from the north in case it takes a while to navigate the Ganga upstream.Not least for his light demeanour, Oli is taken seriously only for his stance in the face of India’s blockade in 2015 and his opening up avenues across the Himalaya. His visit to the north this time draws a tangent to the south. BRI or no BRI, Nepali politicians must be able to reassure the domestic population that their aspirations will be fulfilled more by internal effort than through external dealings. Without delivery, platforms like the jagaran (awakening) rally will only let the people down. \nImagine, for a moment, walking through the streets of Dhaka on a cold winter morning. The smog hangs thick in the air, wrapping the city in a grey blanket. The sun, struggling to break through, casts a dull light over the buildings. This isn't just an unpleasant sight, it's a sign of a public health emergency. The \"State of Global Air 2024\" report confirms what many of us already know—Dhaka has one of the worst air quality in the world, consistently ranking among the top cities with hazardous pollution levels. On one particular morning, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Dhaka was measured at 291—labelled \"very unhealthy.\" This means that every breath we take in Dhaka carries harmful particles that can damage our lungs, hearts, and even brains.The problem is not just the occasional bad day—it is a constant, pervasive issue. Every year, more than 230,000 people in Bangladesh die from diseases linked to air pollution, and many of these deaths are avoidable. Perhaps the most heartbreaking fact is that children are bearing the brunt of this pollution. According to the latest report, air pollution is the second-leading cause of death among children under five, after malnutrition. In 2021, over 19,000 children in Bangladesh died from air pollution-related diseases, such as pneumonia and asthma. These are not just statistics—they represent children who never had the chance to grow up.In many ways, this situation mirrors the bleak descriptions of industrialised cities found in classic English literature. Take, for example, Charles Dickens' portrayal of Victorian London in Bleak House, where the fog was not just a physical phenomenon but a symbol of the social and moral decay of the time. The thick, suffocating fog in Dickens' novel could be seen as a metaphor for the way pollution clouds our judgment today—distorting our understanding of the consequences of our actions and making it difficult to see the full picture of the damage we are causing to the environment and to each other. Just as the poor of Dickens' London suffered most in the industrial age, today it is the poorest communities in Dhaka, along with our children, who are most affected by the toxic air.As we look around, it's hard to ignore the fact that the streets of Dhaka, like those of Dickensian London, are filled with people who have little choice but to breathe in the polluted air. But unlike the poor workers of the past, we have the knowledge and resources to act. We know the dangers. The question is: will we take responsibility for the future of our city and its people?Air pollution, particularly the fine particles known as PM2.5, is the silent killer here. These particles are so small that they can enter our lungs and bloodstream, causing long-term damage. Children are especially vulnerable because their lungs are still developing, and they breathe in more air relative to their body weight than adults do. This means that every breath a child takes in Dhaka could be harmful. In fact, the pollutants in the air can cause lifelong health issues, including asthma, lung diseases, and even brain development problems. As a result, children grow up in a city that doesn't just limit their dreams—it limits their health.Dhaka's air pollution is not just a human problem, it is a problem that affects the environment as well. Just as a novel's setting shapes the characters, the environment shapes the lives of those who live in it. In Dhaka, the air is no longer something we can take for granted. It is a poisoned gift, one that we have collectively polluted through our choices—choices about how we build, how we commute, and how we use energy.The dense fog in the streets, the visible haze over the skyline, are not just symptoms of a poorly managed city, they are the result of years of environmental neglect. We have allowed the city to grow without the necessary green spaces, proper waste management, and a public transportation system that reduces the need for countless private cars. The irony is that, despite all the noise, the real crisis is silent. The children suffer in ways that are unseen, and we have become numb to the changes happening around us.But we do not have to resign ourselves to this fate. There is hope if we choose to act. We can invest in cleaner technologies, such as electric vehicles and green public transport systems. We can clean up our industries and encourage businesses to adopt sustainable practices. We can also work to improve household air quality by providing alternatives to polluting fuels. The government and citizens must work together to find solutions.The health of our children, the future of Dhaka, and the future of our planet depend on the choices we make today. It is time to change the narrative, take control of our story, and ensure that the air we breathe is not the tragic backdrop to our lives but a source of life, health, and hope for future generations. The thick, suffocating fog we face is not inevitable—it is a challenge we must overcome for the sake of our children and the world they will inherit.—The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nMany may find a pair of recent decisions on constitution implementation and amendment in Nepal baffling. It was nearly five months ago that the country’s two largest political parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—joined hands to form a coalition government, an unusual practice in a parliamentary system. They argued that the need for the constitution amendment made them forge an alliance as such a move would need a two-thirds parliamentary majority and a broad political understanding.Months after the two forces crafted a coalition government with the promise to amend the constitution, a parliamentary committee formed a sub-panel to conduct a detailed study of the laws needed for full-fledged implementation of the constitution promulgated in September 2015. The Legislation Management Committee of the National Assembly has set up a five-member subcommittee to study how many laws still need to be enacted. An earlier study conducted by a similar panel under the leadership of lawmaker Anita Devkota had found that 40 laws need amendments or replacement to align with the constitution. The earlier committee’s report, which was endorsed by the full committee in June last year, made several recommendations to the legislature and the government to update the laws in line with the constitution. But instead of doing so, the government and the parliament have either not drafted the bills or sat on several ones in the House. Now, the upper house has formed one more sub-committee.The Congress-UML coalition floated the proposal of constitution amendment while without first doing even the basics to implement the constitution. They haven’t formulated laws to allow the provincial and local authorities to use the rights enshrined in the constitution. Chief ministers of the seven provinces have been continuously pressing top leaders in Kathmandu to make necessary laws. They argue that the provinces have failed in delivery mainly in the absence of their own police and civil servants. There are several other sectors where sub-national governments have failed to perform in the absence of necessary laws as required by the constitution. This shows the hollowness of the political parties’ advocacy for constitution amendment. Really, how can a constitution’s performance be judged and amended without first fully implementing it? And, will the major political forces that didn’t even formulate laws needed for the full-fledged implementation of the statute in the past nine years suddenly start working to improve the national charter? So the problem lies in the honesty of the leaders. It’s no secret that top leaders of major parties—mainly the Congress and the UML—were not in favour of the federal system. They agreed to embrace it in the face of a wave of movement in favour of state restructuring that picked up during the eight-year-long constitution writing period. While the Congress and the UML leaders accepted federalism reluctantly, CPN (Maoist Centre) chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal has often used federalism-related issues as a political tool. It was evident in the course of naming Koshi Province. While finalising the name, he first instructed Maoist lawmakers to vote in favour of naming the province ‘Koshi’ and later he provoked ethnic communities to keep fighting for an identity-based nomenclature. In sum, at the core of the problem lies the leaders’ reluctance to devolve the centralised powers to the sub-national authorities. Such confusion and contradiction will keep cropping up until the leaders are committed to formulating necessary laws and clearing the way to allow provincial and local authorities to exercise their constitutional rights. \n: A fire in a house in ward 9 of Marsyangdi Rural Municipality in Lamjung district, claimed the life of a 45-year-old man on Thursday night.The deceased, identified as Dharti Tamang, was originally from Chitwan. Tamang was living in the stone-and-mud house owned by Lukumari Gurung for the past two years, said Deputy Superintendent of Police Nishant Srivastava. His body has been sent to the District Hospital in Besisahar for postmortem. According to police, the fire broke out at around 11pm and was controlled by 2am. Local resident Tej Bahadur Gurung said Tamang’s charred body was recovered after the fire was extinguished. Authorities and locals suspect the fire started from Tamang’s room, possibly from a cigarette butt that ignited a nearby straw heap. Police are conducting further investigations into the incident. \nIsraeli military strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians overnight in the Gaza Strip, most of them in the Nuseirat camp at the centre of the enclave, medics said on Friday, after some tanks pulled back from an area they had raided.Medics said they had recovered 19 bodies of Palestinians killed in northern areas of Nuseirat, one of the enclave’s eight long-standing refugee camps.The rest were killed in the northern and southern areas of the Gaza Strip, medics added. There was no fresh statement by the Israeli military on Friday, but on Thursday it said its forces were continuing to “strike terror targets as part of the operational activity in the Gaza Strip”.Some Israeli tanks remained active in the western area of the camp and the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said teams were unable to respond to distress calls from residents trapped inside their houses.Medics said an Israeli drone later on Friday killed Ahmed Al-Kahlout, head of the Intensive Care Unit at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip, where the army has been operating since early October.Al-Kahlout was killed by a missile fired from the drone as he walked through the hospital gate, two medical officials at Kamal Adwan Hospital told Reuters. Earlier in the week, the director of the hospital and 12 other medics were wounded in similar attacks, the Gaza health ministry said.There was no immediate Israeli army comment.Kamal Adwan Hospital is one of three medical facilities on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip that are now barely operational due to shortages of medical, fuel, and food supplies. Health officials said most of its medical staff had been either detained or expelled by the Israeli army.DisplacementsThe Israeli army said forces operating in Beit Lahiya, Jabalia and Beit Hanoun since Oct. 5 aimed to prevent Hamas militants from regrouping and waging attacks from those areas. Residents said the army was depopulating the towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun as well as the Jabalia refugee camp.The head of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said on Thursday Israel’s seven-week offensive in the northern edge of Gaza had uprooted some 130,000 people.Meanwhile, Israeli authorities released around 30 Palestinians whom it had detained in the past few months during its Gaza offensive. Those released arrived at a hospital in southern Gaza for medical checkups, medics said.Freed Palestinians, detained during the war, have complained of ill-treatment and torture in Israeli detention after they were released. Israel denies torture.Months of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza have yielded scant progress, and negotiations are now on holdA ceasefire in the parallel conflict between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, took effect before dawn on Wednesday, bringing a halt to hostilities that had escalated sharply in recent months and had overshadowed the Gaza conflict.Announcing the Lebanon accord on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said he would now renew his push for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, urging Israel and Hamas to seize the moment.Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 44,300 people and displaced nearly all the enclave’s population at least once, Gaza officials say. Vast swathes of the territory are in ruins.The Hamas-led militants who attacked southern Israeli communities 13 months ago, triggering the war, killed some 1,200 people and captured more than 250 hostages, Israel has said. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nAustralians reacted on Friday with a mixture of anger and relief to a social media ban on children under 16 that the government says is world-leading, but which tech giants like TikTok argue could push young people to “darker corners of the internet”.Australia approved the social media ban for children late on Thursday after an emotive debate that has gripped the nation, setting a benchmark for jurisdictions around the world with one of the toughest regulations targeting Big Tech.The law forces tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) to TikTok to stop minors from logging in or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million). A trial of enforcement methods will start in January, with the ban to take effect in a year.“Platforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday.“We’re making sure that mums and dads can have that different conversation today and in future days.”Announcing the details of the ban earlier this month, Albanese cited the risks to physical and mental health of children from excessive social media use, in particular the risks to girls from harmful depictions of body image, and misogynist content aimed at boys.In Sydney on Friday, reaction to the ban was mixed.“I think that’s a great idea, because I found that the social media for kids (is) not really appropriate, sometimes they can look at something they shouldn’t,” said Sydney resident Francesca Sambas.Others were more scathing.“I’m feeling very angry, I feel that this government has taken democracy and thrown it out the window,” said 58-year-old Shon Klose.“How could they possibly make up these rules and these laws and push it upon the people?”Children, meanwhile, said they would try to find a way around the ban.“I feel like I still will use it, just secretly get in,” said 11-year-old Emma Wakefield.WORLD FIRSTCountries including France and some US states have passed laws to restrict access for minors without a parent’s permission, but the Australian ban is absolute. A full under-14s ban in Florida is being challenged in court on free speech grounds.Albanese’s Labor party won crucial support from the opposition conservatives for the bill that was fast-tracked through the country’s parliament as part of 31 bills pushed through in a chaotic final day of parliament for the year.The government has said enough notice was given as it first flagged the ban after a parliamentary inquiry earlier this year that heard testimony from parents of children who had self-harmed due to cyber bullying.But it was criticised by social media firms and some lawmakers who say the bill has lacked proper scrutiny.A spokesperson for TikTok, which is hugely popular with teen users, said on Friday the process had been rushed and risked putting children into greater danger.“We’re disappointed the Australian government has ignored the advice of the many mental health, online safety, and youth advocacy experts who have strongly opposed the ban,” the spokesperson said.Albanese said on Friday passing the bill before the age verification trial has been completed was the correct approach.“We’ve got your back is our message to Australian parents,” Albanese said.“We don’t argue that its implementation will be perfect, just like the alcohol ban for under 18s doesn’t mean that someone under 18 never has access, but we know that it’s the right thing to do.”The ban could strain Australia’s relationship with key ally the United States, where X owner Elon Musk, a central figure in the administration of president-elect Donald Trump, said in a post this month it seemed a “backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians”.It also builds on an existing mood of antagonism between Australia and mostly US-domiciled tech giants. Australia was the first country to make social media platforms pay media outlets royalties for sharing their content and now plans to threaten them with fines for failing to stamp out scams. \nNepal’s leading internet service provider, WorldLink Communications has received an investment of €10 million from Finnfund, Finland’s development financier.The agreement was signed by WorldLink’s Chairman, Dileep Agrawal, and Finnfund’s Senior Investment Manager and Head of Digital Infrastructure and Solutions Portfolio, Kutti Kilpeläinen, in the presence of Finland’s Minister for Foreign Trade and Development, Ville Tavio.“WorldLink has been working towards bridging the digital divide in Nepal by expanding its services to rural and remote areas,” said Kutti Kilpeläinen. “As a Finnish investor, we also value the fact that WorldLink is using Nokia’s advanced technology to expand its services.”“Finnfund is ready to assist WorldLink in managing environmental and social risks during the data centre construction,” Kilpeläinen added.WorldLink Chairman Agrawal described the investment as an important step in expanding internet access nationwide. “This funding will help us accelerate digital transformation, bridging the gap between urban and rural areas.”The collaboration between Nokia, a Finnish technology and equipment manufacturer, and WorldLink aims to offer customers a more reliable, faster, and secure internet experience.Worldlink with over 5,000 employees has been able to attract significant foreign investment from British International Investment (BII) and Dolma Impact Fund (DIF), the internet service provider said. Finnfund, a development and impact investor, focuses on sustainable businesses primarily in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It only invests in countries defined as developing by the OECD/DAC, read a press release issued after the signing ceremony.  \nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday made the official announcement of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s upcoming visit to China.According to the ministry, Oli will pay an official visit to China from December 2 to 5 at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang. During the visit, he will hold bilateral talks with Premier Li and exchange views on matters of mutual interest.Oli is also scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China.As part of the visit, the prime minister will deliver a keynote address at Peking University. He will also address the Nepal-China Business Forum, co-hosted by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI).The prime minister’s entourage will include Arzu Rana Deuba, minister for Foreign Affairs; Bishnu Prasad Rimal, chief adviser to the prime minister; Yuba Raj Khatiwada, economic and development advisor; members of parliament; high-ranking government officials; representatives of the private sector; and media persons.In preparation for Oli’s visit, Foreign Minister Rana Deuba left for China on Thursday at the invitation of her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. This marks her first official visit to China since her appointment as minister in July.During her visit, Rana will hold bilateral talks with Wang in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, and convey Nepal’s proposals for implementing projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). She is expected to return to Nepal on Saturday.The visit comes as the Oli-led coalition government prepares to navigate Nepal’s position on the BRI. Continuous negotiations between ruling coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—are underway to finalise Nepal’s stance on development cooperation with China. The BRI remains a key area of focus for Nepal’s engagement with its northern neighbour. \nOil prices rose slightly on Friday following a potential renewal of supply risk as Israel and Hezbollah traded accusations of ceasefire violations, and as a delay to an OPEC+ meeting left investors awaiting a decision on its output policy.Brent crude futures rose 10 cents, or 0.1%, to $73.38 a barrel by 0516 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $69.17, up 45 cents, or 0.7%, compared to Wednesday’s closing price.On a weekly basis, Brent futures were down 2.4% and the US WTI benchmark was trading 2.9% lower. Trading remained thin due to the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday that shut US financial markets.Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah traded accusations on Thursday over alleged violations of their ceasefire that came into effect the day before. The deal had at first appeared to alleviate the potential for supply disruption from a broader conflict that had led to a risk premium for oil.Oil supplies from the Middle East, though, have been largely unaffected during Israel’s parallel conflicts with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, delayed its next policy meeting to December 5 from December 1 to avoid a scheduling conflict. OPEC+ is expected to further extend its production cuts at the meeting.BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, downgraded its Brent price forecast on Friday to $76/bbl in 2025 from $78/bbl previously, citing a “bearish fundamental outlook, ongoing weakness in oil market sentiment and the downside pressure on prices we expect to accrue under Trump.”“Although we expect the OPEC+ group will opt to roll over the existing cuts into the new year, this will not be sufficient to fully erase the production glut we forecast for next year,” BMI analysts said in a note.Also on Thursday, Russia struck Ukrainian energy facilities for the second time this month. ANZ analysts said the attack risked retaliation that could affect Russian oil supply.Iran told a UN nuclear watchdog it would install more than 6,000 additional uranium-enriching centrifuges at its enrichment plants, a confidential report by the watchdog said on Thursday.Analysts at Goldman Sachs have said Iranian supply could drop by as much as 1 million barrels per day in the first half of next year if Western powers tighten sanctions enforcement on its crude oil output. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nBikram Timilsina is the chair and research fellow of the Asian Institute for Advanced Research (AIFAR), Kathmandu. He is an interdisciplinary researcher with expertise in politics, geopolitics, climate change, peace processes, and social inclusion. He holds a PhD in politics and international relations from Griffith University, Australia and two master’s degrees in International Studies and English. Timilsina’s passion for reading literary books began in childhood. During his school years in Nuwakot, he was driven to read more. Despite its proximity to Kathmandu, Nuwakot lacked library access, leaving him without the opportunity to explore his interest in books. Reflecting on his early years, Timilsina shares, “We formed a group of friends under the Pratibha Bidyarthi Manch, a youth student club we established. Through initiatives like organising the Deusi Bhailo programme, we raised funds to set up a library in our village.”He ran a literary show on Radio Sagarmatha from 2004 to 2014. This passion paved the way for his Gajal collection, ‘Ali Ali Chot Deu’, published in 2006. Moreover, he has published articles on national and international platforms. In this conversation with the Post’s Sanskriti Pokharel, Timilsina discusses how he balances academic readings with literary books. Do you read for knowledge or comfort? I don’t usually choose books based on preconceived expectations. Instead, I rely on a few personal criteria when selecting what to read. At times, books and their characters inspire me; other times, I turn to them for sheer joy and enjoyment. My current interests often shape my book choices. If researching the Nepal-India relationship, I lean toward books that align with that topic. In this way, my reading becomes a source of knowledge and comfort while mirroring my intellectual interests and current priorities.How do you balance academic readings with literary books as an interdisciplinary researcher?As an interdisciplinary researcher, balancing academic readings with literary books can be challenging. I often turn to literature during breaks from academic work, finding it a refreshing escape. However, I must admit that lately, I’ve felt somewhat disconnected from literary reading.Several recently purchased literary books remain untouched, awaiting the time and attention they deserve. The demands of my professional commitments and academic research have made it challenging to dedicate time to leisurely reading. To address this, I’m considering reserving my weekends—Saturdays and Sundays—exclusively for literary exploration. This approach will help me better balance academic pursuits with the joy of reading literature.How did you go from earning a degree in English to International Relations?I completed my first Master’s degree in English in 2007. Over time, I began developing a deeper awareness of political and current affairs. As I became more informed, I reflected on Nepal's challenges, questioning why the country struggles to progress, why politics is often dismissed as a ‘dirty game’ and what changes are necessary for a positive transformation.As a citizen, my curiosity expanded beyond literature. I felt compelled to understand Nepal's political, social, and geographical issues. I was impacted by the country’s fragile position between two powerful neighbours and its struggle to find stability during the Comprehensive Peace Accord. Nepal was still wrestling with conflict then, and the dream of lasting peace felt distant.These reflections inspired a strong desire to contribute to peacebuilding, geopolitics, and international relations. This led me to pursue a PhD in politics and international relations, where I could delve into these pressing issues and work toward meaningful solutions for Nepal’s future.Does literature complement your political and social research?Absolutely. My background in literature has shaped who I am today. Studying literature goes far beyond reading fiction or poetry; it involves engaging with diverse philosophical foundations and critical theories developed by thinkers over time. For example, exploring fields like feminism, postcolonialism, cultural studies, and deconstruction offers deep insights into power dynamics, identity, and societal structures.These theoretical frameworks are essential for understanding different worldviews and grasping the core principles of politics and international relations. My master’s degree in English provided me with valuable insights into these theories, which became instrumental as I ventured into international relations and politics. It helped me navigate complex global issues and perspectives more easily while equipping me with analytical tools to interpret and better understand political and social phenomena.I feel fortunate to have studied literature, as it laid a strong foundation that enriched my approach to political and social research. It also highlighted the interconnectedness between the humanities and the social sciences, enabling me to view these fields through a broader and more nuanced lens.Do specific genres help you understand the complex issues you study? In terms of genres, I am fond of reading both fiction and non-fiction. I love to read prose, which is more poetic. I enjoy books that reflect the natural world's complexity, often inspiring readers to compare the world in literature with those outside it. As a researcher addressing issues, I sometimes connect the problems depicted in literature to those in reality. While being well-informed is essential in research, imagination is just as important. The imaginative world of literature has given me valuable ideas and insights for my work.How does reading inspire your writing?Reading influences my writing approach. Fiction opens doors to human emotions and complexities, fostering empathy and creativity. It challenges my imagination, helping me explore different narrative styles, often shaping how I express ideas and build arguments.Nonfiction, on the other hand, sharpens my analytical thinking. It presents strong arguments, factual depth, and clear reasoning, enhancing my critical skills. These genres nurture creativity and precision—essential traits for any writer. This balance enriches my understanding of issues.Every book I read, whether fiction or nonfiction, sparks a continuous dialogue in my mind, inspiring me to write with originality, depth, and purpose.Bikram Timilsina’s book recommendationsAntarmanko YatraAuthor: Jagadish GhimirePublisher: Book HillYear: 2008This rare book reminds me of life’s impermanence.

He was allegedly involved in a fraud case involving the Kalimati-based Swarnalakshmi Cooperative.According to police officials, Lamichhane was transferred to Kathmandu after recording his statement on the charges of embezzling deposits borrowed from the Suryadarshan Cooperative in Pokhara.The Kathmandu District Court issued an arrest warrant against Lamichhane on November 17 for his alleged role in misappropriating funds from the Swarnalakshmi Cooperative.An arrest warrant was also issued against former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, one of the partners of Lamichhane in Gorkha Media Network, in connection with the Swarnalakshmi case. Joshi’s statement was recorded at the District Attorney’s Office in Kathmandu.The Kaski Court on November 24 extended his remand by an additional 15 days for further investigation. Lamichhane had been in custody for over 40 days when the latest remand was granted. While investigations in Kaski focus on cooperatives fraud, organised crime, and money laundering, Lamichhane is also implicated in similar cases involving Butwal's Supreme Cooperative and was previously questioned by the Rupandehi District Attorney’s Office.Following his statement in Kathmandu, Lamichhane will be returned to Kaski. Additionally, arrest warrants have been issued against Lamichhane and others in Chitwan.Lamichhane was apprehended by a Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) team from the RSP’s central office in Banasthali, Kathmandu on October 18, and transported to Pokhara for investigation. Previous probes including the one conducted by a special parliamentary committee alleged that he, as the managing director of the the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network, was involved in diverting funds from multiple cooperatives, including Rs30 million, into personal accounts. \nThe Election Commission is all set to hold the local bypolls on December 1. Three of the 44 vacant posts have seen representatives elected unopposed. According to the commission, at least 377 people are in the fray for the remaining posts.The district coordination committee candidates in Kailali and Okhaldhunga won unopposed from the Nepali Congress. While Tek Raj Bhattarai and Tika Kumari Chaudhary of the Congress were unchallenged, CPN (Maoist Centre) candidate Jagat Gharti had no contenders for the Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality ward 2 chairperson post, according to election officials.“We are all set to conduct the by-elections,” said Nita Pokharel Aryal, spokesperson for the Election Commission.Although 25 political parties have registered to participate in the by-elections for the local governments, the Hamro Nepal Party, the Nepal Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), the Nepali Congress (BP), the Nepal Janata Dal, and the Aam Janta Party did not field any contestants. Only 20 political parties are taking part in the election.According to the Local Level Election Act 2017, if the position of the district coordination committee chief, deputy chief, rural municipality chairman, vice-chairman, municipality mayor, deputy mayor and ward chair falls vacant for any reason before the end of their term and if more than one year of their term remains, the remaining term will be filled through a by-election.Congress had won most of the seats where the by-elections are taking place. Possibly for that reason, Congress has gone to the by-elections under the command of the party’s General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma.“Congress won 30 of the seats that are now vacant,” said Shyam Kumar Ghimire, the party's chief whip. “We aim to retain them through the by-election.”The Congress failed to perform well in the last two by-elections—held in 2023 and April 2024—to elect federal and provincial lawmakers. According to Ghimire, Congress lawmakers from the respective districts where the by-elections are being held are already in their constituency to help the party’s candidates.“Apart from them, even lawmakers from other districts are in the campaign to make sure Congress candidates win the election,” Ghimire said.After the Congress, the Maoist Centre lost its seven elected representatives since the last local election. The Maoist leaders also express confidence in retaining the posts.“Respective leaders in charge of the parties’ provincial committees lead their by-election campaigns, and the federal and provincial lawmakers are also on the campaign trail,” Shreeram Dhakal, the Maoist Centre office secretary, said.Leaders of CPN-UML, which lost seven ward chairpersons, claim that they will win more seats. While the Congress has fielded its General Secretary Sharma as the election commander, the UML has not given any specific task related to the by-election to any of its central leaders.“The election department of the party is overseeing the campaign, and our party has not assigned any central leader as the commander per se,” said Niraj Acharya, the UML poll department head.Among the 30 posts up for grabs, the Congress secured two seats unopposed, while the Maoist Centre took one without contest. The UML and the Maoist Centre do not seem to have put their focus on the by-elections the same way as the Congress. However, federal and provincial lawmakers of the UML in whose district election is taking place are also on the field.Among the 41 posts, Koshi and Karnali provinces are holding by-elections for eight posts each. Madhesh and Bagmati will witness by-elections for seven posts. Sudurpaschim will have the by-election for five posts and Lumbini six. A by-election will be held in Gandaki for a post only.The by-election will be held for one municipal mayor, two village council chairmen, four vice-chairmen, one deputy mayor, and 33 ward chairmen. According to the Election Commission, elections will also be held for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in Kathmandu and the deputy mayor of Nalgad Municipality in Jajarkot.Similarly, elections will be held for the posts of chairperson of Gramthan Rural Municipality of Morang and Mahabu Rural Municipality of Dailekh, Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha, Sarkegad Rural Municipality of Humla, and vice chairperson of Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality of Bajura.Elections will be held for the ward chairperson of Sirijanga Rural Municipality-3 of Taplejung, Kankai Municipality-6 of Jhapa, Laligurans Municipality-8 of Tehrathum, Gadhi Rural Municipality-6 of Sunsari, Molung Rural Municipality-5 of Okhaldhunga, and Triyuga Municipality-12 of Udayapur.Likewise, elections will be held for ward chairpersons in Belka Municipality-9 of Udayapur, Dakneshwari Municipality wards 1 and 4 of Saptari, Dhanushadham Municipality-1 of Dhanusha, Ramgopalpur Municipality-2 of Mahottari, Ishanath Municipality-7, Rajpur Municipality-6 and Gadhimai Municipality-8 of Rautahat. The Kathmandu Metropolitan City ward 16 holds the election for the post of ward chairperson. Two wards of Kirtipur Municipality, 1 and 4, will also have the election.Kakani Rural Municipality-2 of Nuwakot, Hetauda Sub-metropolitan City-12 of Makawanpur, Gorkha Municipality-5 of Gorkha, Musikot Municipality-1 of Gulmi, Runtigadhi Rural Municipality-4 of Rolpa, Thakurbaba Municipality-4 of Bardiya, and Suddhodhan Rural Municipality-1 of Kapilvastu also will have the by-election, according to the Election Commission.Similarly, elections will also be held for ward chairpersons in Dullu Municipality-13 of Dailekh, Tilagufa Municipality-4 of Kalikot, Kushe Rural Municipality-7 of Jajarkot, Tripurasundari Municipality-5 of Dolpa, Sanibheri Rural Municipality-5 of Rukum (West), Surma Rural Municipality-4 of Bajhang, Purbichauki Rural Municipality-6 of Doti, Duhun Rural Municipality-5 of Darchula and Bhimdatta Municipality-6 of Kanchanpur. \nNepal plans to ask China to provide grants to execute projects under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s upcoming visit to China.A new memorandum of understanding (MoU) will be signed to expedite BRI projects, by clearly mentioning the projects in the MoU, as per the latest understanding between the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML which is subject to be approved by the Chinese side.As the prime minister is set to visit the northern neighbour from December 2, the BRI is now in focus, with various quarters keen to see how Nepal will navigate and negotiate the BRI deal with China. Kathmandu is currently considering the BRI implementation plan proposed by Beijing. The new MoU might be titled “Cooperation Framework on Jointly Building of the BRI between Nepal and China,” said the members of the task force, and it will be shared with the Chinese side for their approval.If approved by the Chinese side, a new MoU on BRI will be signed during Oli’s visit besides other agreements, said a senior foreign ministry official. A few MoUs and instruments are proposed for signing during the visit and the two sides have already exchanged the list, including the text of a joint communique to be issued after Oli’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang on December 3 in Beijing. A joint taskforce comprising representatives of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML has drastically revised the implementation plan and trimmed it down to focus on specific projects, according to leaders. Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba will leave for China on Thursday. During her meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Chengdu, Rana will convey the message of the Oli-led coalition government and present Nepal’s terms and conditions, said a Nepali Congress leader privy to the developments. Ruling partners Congress and the UML have held extensive discussions over the past couple of weeks on how Nepal should pursue an agreement with Beijing on the BRI’s implementation. Members of the taskforce met on Wednesday evening to finalise the revised text on the BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side which is now revisited by the ruling party leaders.Prime Minister Oli is scheduled to visit China on December 2 and Foreign Minister Rana’s trip to the north is to lay the ground for that.The Congress and the UML have reached an understanding that Nepal should seek grants to fund specific projects under the BRI, which will be listed in a new MoU, said the Congress leader. The joint task force comprising four members—two each from Congress and UML—under the guidance of Prime Minister Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, has reached a tentative agreement to sign a new MoU on BRI in Beijing. The name and content of the proposed agreement has been kept secret by both sides.“The new MoU on BRI implementation will focus on specific issues and projects required at present,” said a member of the task force, adding, “The original text of the BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 has been revised drastically and it will be handed over by Foreign Minister Rana to her counterpart Wang in Chengdu.”“There is no need to include every detail or ambiguous language in the agreement that could lead to multiple interpretations. We want to see BRI as a development cooperation vehicle that will focus on projects related to connectivity, infrastructure and energy,” said the taskforce member.In her meeting with Wang, Foreign Minister Rana will discuss the new BRI understanding, projects to be funded under the BRI framework, and preparations for the prime minister’s visit, said a foreign ministry official.Rana’s three-day official visit follows an invitation from her Chinese counterpart Wang, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kathmandu stated. The foreign minister is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Wang on Friday. According to the ministry’s statement, the two leaders will have comprehensive discussions on matters of mutual interests. At a function on Wednesday, UML Deputy General Secretary Pradeep Gyawali said Nepal should clearly communicate with the Chinese about our common interests. “If our interests do not align with theirs, we should politely decline the Chinese proposals,” said Gyawali. “Discussions and deliberations in Nepal are polarised between grant versus loan for undertaking BRI projects and this is not right,” he added. “Any foreign assistance should not be seen through the lens of political ideology. We should see the conditions attached. If the grants come with conditions, we should decline. On the other hand, we are not in a stage of taking loans in a way that will put pressure on our economy. If our economic growth was satisfactory, we could take the loan, but with our economic growth struggling to reach four percent, we cannot sustain debt and its servicing,” said Gyawali. Congress leader Prakash Sharan Mahat, who as foreign minister led the BRI negotiations with China in 2017 and signed the MoU on BRI, echoed similar views. “Be it India, China, the US or any other country, any economic cooperation should be based on bilateral negotiations and should meet the conditions of both sides,” Mahat said. “We should not get carried away thinking that China or India or the US will be unhappy with us since we did not take economic cooperation and assistance on their terms and conditions.”“If we follow this principle of taking economic cooperation and assistance on our terms and conditions, that will not create any difficulties,” he said at an interaction held at the Centre for Social Inclusion and Foreign Policy.“It took me over seven months to finalise the MoU of BRI in 2017,” said Mahat. “We did a lot of homework and prepared the draft after removing several proposals sent by the Chinese side.” \nAmid sluggish progress in law promulgation, the Legislation Management Committee of the National Assembly has decided to conduct a detailed study of the laws needed for the full-fledged implementation of the constitution promulgated around a decade ago.The committee has formed a five-member sub-committee led by Beduram Bhusal, a CPN (Unified Socialist) lawmaker to assess the progress made in law promulgation and also find out how many laws, and from which sector, still need to be enacted. The sub-committee has been given a month for the study and submit a report.The committee, after a similar study last year, had found that only 111 laws among the 151 required to implement the 2015 constitution had been enacted by July 2023. It had pointed out that 40 Acts needed either major amendments or replacement to bring them in sync with the constitution.Appearing before the upper house, then prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, had said the government was serious towards drafting the necessary bills and registering them in the federal parliament. But his government failed to walk the talk. The incumbent government too has not made serious attempts to introduce these necessary bills.“The sub-committee will study what progress has been made since last year,” said Tulasa Kumari Dahal, chairperson of the House committee. “It will study minutely as to which ministry needs which laws to implement the constitution.”Once the Bhusal-led panel submits its report, the House committee will hold discussion with the prime minister and relevant ministers. “We will try to seek explanations for the delay and instruct the government to expedite the preparations of the necessary bills,” she said.The constitution had set two deadlines to prepare laws for its implementation. It mandated the passage of laws related to fundamental rights within three years of the charter’s promulgation. The federal parliament endorsed the bills related to 31 fundamental rights a day before the constitutional deadline of September 19, 2018.As per the statute, the Acts that contradict the constitution must have been revised within a year since the first meeting of the federal parliament on March 5, 2018. Though several laws were enacted, dozens are still waiting for parliamentary approval.One major constitutional mandate involves devolving authority to manage school education from the federal government to local governments. However, the federal education law has yet to be enacted. Similarly, the federal civil service bill is also stuck in a parliamentary committee.Other crucial laws, including those related to health, citizenship and the authority of the President and Vice President have also not been enacted.The report says some of the laws in force date back as far back as 1953. Similarly, dozens of Acts are from the Panchayat era (1961-1990). For instance, the Education Act from 1972 and Infectious Disease Act from 1962 remain in force.In its report, the House committee had instructed the government to revise the Panchayat era laws to align with the present day needs. However, little progress has been made in this regard.It is the government that prepares bills and registers them in parliament. They become the Act, only after they get through both the Houses of the federal parliament and receive the Presidential seal. The government, however, solely is not responsible for the delay in having the necessary laws in place. Failure of the House committees in readying the bills to be tabled for the endorsement too is equally responsible for the delay. For instance, different House committees are sitting on 16 bills for months. Despite repetitive instructions from Speaker Devraj Ghimire, the House panels also called mini-parliaments have not been active.The upcoming winter session of the House, known as bills session, is likely to be without substantial business because neither the House committees have finalized the pending bills nor has the government registered new bills. It has been more than four months since the last bill was registered.  \nThe conflict between the Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah and leadership of the ruling party, the CPN-UML, seems to be deepening as the two sides show no sign of rapprochement.In the latest episode, the KMC has fined the ruling UML Rs100,000 for littering the streets of the capital city Kathmandu while holding a mass meet on Friday. Within hours of the conclusion of the UML’s ‘Awakening rally against anarchy’ at Durbarmarg in downtown Kathmandu, the KMC made public a decision saying that the city office had fined the ruling party.But the UML leadership took serious exception to the mayor’s action. “It can be understood that Kathmandu Metropolis Mayor Balen [Balendra] has been used [by someone] against the CPN-UML, which has become clearer after the issuance of today’s ‘pamphlet’,” UML General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel wrote on Facebook a few hours after the issuance of the city office’s fine notice. He claimed that members of the rally organising committee were busy cleaning the area on their own when the metropolitan officials issued the notice.KMC representatives reached the UML party office in Chyasal on Sunday to hand over the receipt of the fine issued on Friday. After the party refused to receive it, the notice of fine was sent to the party office by email today (Monday), said Nabin Manandhar, KMC spokesperson. UML’s office secretary, Bhisma Adhikari, denied the allegations that the party littered the street during the rally. If there had been rubbish, our cadres would have cleaned it up. Adhikari said, “But the KMC issued a notice against us to defame our party, which is a politically motivated action.” Adhikari also stated that his party wouldn’t pay the fine and that the party office had not received any mail from the KMC. The City’s assistant spokesperson, Dhurba Kumar Kafle, differs. Kafle says a team from the environment department and the metropolitan police were present at the demonstration venue. It was only after inspecting the ground that the KMC slapped a fine, he said.Political observers say the KMC has been selective in imposing the fine. They, however, criticised the party for disrupting the traffic on Friday, badly affecting people’s daily lives.“Picking a party to impose a fine but turning a blind eye to similar activities carried out by other parties shows the City’s bias,” Keshav Dahal, a political analyst, said. “To prove they are not biased, the KMC from now on should penalise other political forces and groups as well for carrying out similar activities.” For the past few months, the streets of Kathmandu have witnessed many protests by various political parties. Before the UML, the main opposition party, CPN (Maoist Centre), organised a protest rally on October 26 in Kathmandu. Until recently, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) was in the street, holding multiple street protests in Kathmandu, claiming the arrest of their party chief Rabi Lamichhane was politically motivated. The City spokesperson Manandhar denied the allegation of being biased. “When the other parties had organised protests, the KMC did not see the necessity of issuing a fine as there was less garbage,” Manandhar said. “But the UML’s gathering compelled us to issue a notice of fine.” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, however thinks both the UML and the KMC are engaging in stunts.“The City issued a fine against UML and the UML put up a vehement denial after being imposed a fine. Both were doing stunts,” Subedi said. But it would have been more mature of the UML to respond to the KMC as per existing laws, he added.“If there is a lack of a policy in this connection, the UML could have vowed to bring the policy so that such incidents can be better handled in the future,” Subedi said.On April 9, the KMC had fined the Rastriya Prajantra Party (RPP) Rs5,000 for littering the streets of Kathmandu while staging a protest. Recalling the episode, Nilkantha Kafle, the treasurer of the RPP, said that the party had paid the fine.“We realised that we could have made a mistake by not cleaning up the streets after demonstrations. So we paid the fine,” Kafle said. Political analyst Subedi reckons the latest incident could be the result of bitter relations between UML chair KP Sharma Oli and KMC mayor Balendra Shah.Of late, Prime Minister Oli and other leaders from his party have been engaged in one after another dispute with Mayor Shah. On June 3, Shah accused Oli of engaging in ‘policy corruption’ by being involved in illegal land swap of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in Jhapa. After that, then deputy prime minister and minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth tried to halt the mayor’s plan to widen pavements in the Capital’s New Road area. Mayor Shah even sent metropolitan workers to dump a truckload of dirt in front of the office of the road department, which is under Mahaseth’s ministry.In September, Mayor Shah criticised Prime Minister Oli for failing to take action against UML provincial assembly member Rekha Sharma, who was accused of abusing a child domestic worker for eight years.“The court has also decided to prosecute the accused,” Shah wrote on Facebook. “Respected prime minister, good governance entails taking action against your lawmaker accused of domestic violence.”“Perhaps to you, good governance is limited to announcing a compensation of Rs100,000 and shedding crocodile tears on Facebook over her death,” Mayor Shah wrote on the social media post. Previously, the UML and Mayor Shah had argued for and against implementing the Supreme Court ruling that ordered vacating the Bagmati riverside land.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nDharahara, which reopened to the public on Constitution Day this year, has started charging entry fees from Sunday. Over 90,000 people have climbed the new iconic tower for free since it opened on September 19, but visitors will now need to pay Rs200 per person. Students, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities will be given a 50 percent discount.The Ministry of Urban Development said a fee for visitors from SAARC countries is Rs500 per person, while those from non-SAARC countries will have to pay Rs1,000 each. Entry into the Dharahara premises will cost Rs50. Fees for commercial activities are higher. For instance, it has been set at Rs5,000 per hour for videography, Rs1,000 per hour for photography, and Rs5,000 per hour for non-commercial advertisements on the Dharahara tower. Prakash Aryal, director of the Central Project Implementation Unit (Building and Housing) under the ministry, said that visitors may sometimes face delays as the new system is in the initial stage of implementation. “The time required to manage operations after implementing the fee system might cause delays for those climbing Dharahara,” Aryal said. Visitors can access the tower between 10am and 4pm, but operating hours may be adjusted later. The historic tower will remain closed every Wednesday.The International Convention Centre in New Baneshwar will look after the management until a dedicated committee is formed.The government has declared Dharahara and five other structures, including Jhapa’s Damak View Tower, as ‘special structures’. The Urban Development Ministry has issued an order to facilitate their operation under a public-private partnership model, proposing to lease their management to private entities through competitive bidding. “Minimal fees have been introduced to cover operational expenses such as utilities, staff salaries, and maintenance,” said Mani Ram Gelal, secretary at the ministry. “The state does not intend to make a profit, only to recover costs.” He said it would take at least four months for a private operator to take over once the process is completed. “We cannot provide free access indefinitely, as there are expenses for water, electricity, and staff. While not seeking profit, the fees will help cover operational costs,” said Gelal. Aryal said that by adjusting the schedule and deploying more staff, up to 3,000 visitors could be accommodated daily. “Daily crowds were overwhelming during the free entry period,” he said. “Now we’ll see how the visitor numbers change after introducing fees.” The rebuilt tower, equipped with two lifts, still faces occasional technical problems. Leaks during Tihar, caused by an improperly closed door at the top of the tower, temporarily affected the lifts, but the issue has since been resolved. Online ticketing is expected to be introduced within a month. “Until then, visitors will need to buy tickets at the site,” Aryal said. The Dharahara reconstruction is nearly complete, but some electrical work remains pending. Aryal assured us that the pending work would not affect visitors climbing the tower.The iconic structure, which is historically taken as a major landmark of the capital city Kathmandu, was destroyed by 2015 earthquake. The tower, located at the heart of the City, was rebuilt and reopened to the public nine years after the natural disaster. \n\nWomen and young girls, once excluded from the tradition of playing Newari musical instruments, are now taking the lead in preserving and revitalising the centuries-old Newari musical tradition.One such example of change is the Lubhoo Dhaa Khala, which, according to its members, is the oldest Dhaa group in Lubhu of Lalitpur district. This group performs especially during jatras and other major Newari festivals.The group now boasts a new batch of around 40 musicians, 20 of whom are women and girls. These individuals are mastering the percussive Dhaa and Khin, and the cymbals Tah and Bhusya, instruments historically reserved for men.The group’s performances have now become a central part of local festivities, especially during the Gunla festival—a month-long celebration marking spiritual reflection and cultural devotion.The musical instrument Dhaa is central to the festival’s observance. Known as the Gunla baja, the Dhaa is revered as the Buddha’s favourite instrument and is believed to bring good luck and prosperity when played around chaityas and temples.“In the past, Newari instruments like the Dhaa were associated with male musicians, creating an exclusionary tradition,” says Bekh Narayan Shrestha, the head teacher of Lubhoo Dhaa Khala.However, as social attitudes evolve, so do the practices surrounding these cultural symbols. Women are now claiming their rightful place in this heritage, learning and performing with great panache.Bekh Narayan also says that while in the past playing this instrument was reserved for the higher Shrestha caste, today, caste is no longer a barrier—anyone can be a disciple.Concerned about the traditional instruments nearing extinction, Bekh Narayan took the initiative in 2000 to establish a group and personally began teaching students.While the Lubhoo Dhaa Khala began as a male-dominated group, its evolution into an inclusive space for women is an example of progress. Mandevi Shrestha, 38, who is Bekh Narayan’s daughter, is one beneficiary of the group’s outreach.“I was always a rebel,” Mandevi says. “I put pressure on my father, who was the group’s teacher, to teach us girls as well. I told him, ‘If boys in my own home can learn to play it, why can’t I?”Mandevi adds, “My persistence paid off, and in 2014, five women learners were included in the boys group.”When some women who had joined in 2014 migrated after marriage, the number of women in the group dwindled. At the time, conservative societal attitudes discouraged many women from learning alongside men. Moreover, the women were often not given priority. This led to a temporary halt in teaching women.However, over time, as more women expressed interest and the teachers faced pressure from within their own families—with their daughters and female relatives also wanting to play—by 2017 the group formally began recruiting all-female batches.“When we first started, there was evident discrimination,” says Ashmita Pradhan, 23, who started learning the instrument in 2014 and has been teaching all-female batches since 2017. “Women were not seen as equals then. I’m glad to see things have improved. Nowadays, young girls join the group with full family support.”The change is most evident in the current generation of musicians.Prayusha Shrestha, an 11-year-old student at Future Star Academy in Lubhu, began learning Dhaa in 2023. “After school, I would rush to finish my homework and run to the training sessions,” she says. “I was always excited to learn.”Another student, 20-year-old Sarishma Shrestha, adds, “From childhood, I listened to these instruments. But at the time, participation of girls wasn’t encouraged. When I finally got the chance last year, I was elated.”The inclusion of women in Lubhoo Dhaa Khala has inspired a new generation of learners, some of whom are under 10 years old. While others like Samira Shrestha (25), Neshana Shrestha (24), and Kriti Shrestha (23), have been playing since 2017. This trio belongs to the second batch of female learners, trained by Pradhan herself.According to Samira, in the past, when they played during jatras, there were very few women involved. Despite the judgmental stares, they played with confidence.“Today, the number of girls has increased significantly, and it’s great to see women and girls reclaim their space in preserving our culture, heritage, and music,” Samira says.However, there are still hurdles.According to Mandevi, some instruments, like the Khin, are still predominantly taught to men. “We’re advocating for change,” she says, “so that these traditions become fully inclusive.”For teacher Bekh Narayan, preserving Newari music goes beyond gender inclusivity.He emphasises the need for financial support to sustain the tradition. “Instruments are becoming more expensive,” he says. “We’ve introduced a donation box so even students can contribute, even if it’s just one rupee. We need support from the local government too.”Currently, in the Khala, only the girls from Lubhu are part of the group. So they are now planning to include married daughters-in-law as well.“This will help preserve our culture while empowering homemakers with Newari musicianship, ensuring the culture is passed down generations,” Bekh Narayan says.The members of Lubhoo Dhaa Khala believe their efforts go beyond cultural preservation.Sarishma notes that traditional instruments like the Dhaa enrich Nepal’s musical heritage. “They add diversity to the nation’s music scene, which is often overshadowed by modern and western influences,” she says.In Lubhu, the beats of the Dhaa are no longer produced by just one gender or generation.“Ten years ago, when there were few women, our dedication was often questioned,” Pradhan says. “Now, with more young girls joining, we feel empowered.” \n\nIntrepid DMC Nepal said it has received certification as a “Great Place to Work”, an honour for organisations that foster positive workplace cultures.The company said in a statement that this recognition emphasises its unwavering commitment to creating a people-centred environment where employees thrive through stimulating interactions, career growth opportunities, and a strong sense of inclusion and belonging.This prestigious certification, awarded by the globally renowned Great Place to Work® Institute, is a testament to the company’s dedication to prioritising employee well-being, professional growth, and collaboration. “We are thrilled to receive this recognition,” said Ashish Verma, country general manager of Intrepid DMC Nepal. “At Intrepid, we believe that creating a positive work culture is the foundation of our success. This certification reflects the hard work and passion of our incredible team, whose commitment to excellence inspires everything we do.”Intrepid DMC Nepal, part of the Intrepid Travel Group, specialises in offering unique, responsible, and immersive travel experiences. The company’s focus on sustainability and ethical tourism is mirrored in its workplace ethos, which encourages employees to align personal and professional goals with meaningful impact. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Governors unanimously elected Masato Kanda as ADB’s 11th president. He will assume office on February 24, next year.Kanda, 59, has forty years of experience in international finance and policy and currently serves as Special Advisor to Japan’s Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. He previously served as Deputy Commissioner at the Financial Services Agency, Deputy Director-General of the Budget Bureau, Deputy Vice-Minister for Policy Planning and Coordination, and Vice-Minister of Finance for International Affairs.Kanda holds a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Tokyo and an M.Phil in Economics from Oxford University.Chair of the ADB Board of Governors and Governor of the Bank of Italy, Fabio Panetta, said, “Kanda’s extensive experience in international finance and proven leadership in multilateral settings will serve ADB well in navigating complex global economic challenges and fostering international cooperation.”Kanda has been actively engaged in international forums like G7 and G20, addressing key policy challenges such as the evolution of the multilateral development bank, pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, and debt sustainability and transparency.  \nUjjwal Kumar Shrestha is the executive director of Panchakanya Group, a diversified manufacturing company that has built its reputation over 52 years by specialising in quality and reliable building materials. Beyond manufacturing, the group has ventured into hydropower, trading, construction, and limestone mining, reflecting a diversified portfolio. Shrestha entered Nepal's corporate world in April 2007, when he joined his family business as a marketing manager in the steel and plastic divisions after his return from the US. Shrestha, who believes that no job is big or small and that whatever you do, you must put your heart into it, worked in a cafe in the US. He has always believed that a strong team brings a lot of positive synergy and high consistency, which helps attain goals more competently than through individual efforts. In an email interview with the Post, Shrestha discusses Nepal's current economic situation and challenges, including the company’s plans. Excerpts:As one of Nepal’s oldest business groups, how do you observe the business climate then and now?Despite political instability and labour management challenges, Nepal’s business environment has evolved in the last two decades. Yet, we saw a resilient and hopeful community of businesspeople as we went through the political transitions and drafted our constitution for a stable Nepal. The policies and processes lacked appeal, but financing was accessible, and the consumer market was gradually expanding. Consumption of infrastructure products was slow but showed steady growth with increased manufacturers' capacity utilisation and a healthier competition environment.Then, the 2015 earthquake brought devastation. However, along with the destruction, it brought opportunities to build a more robust and better Nepal through a stable government and improved infrastructure. We saw many commitments from the government for infrastructure-related projects and a surge in industrialisation and new business ventures. As always, in the private sector, without much homework, we started crowding our market to tap into the opportunity of new Nepal until Covid hit us. Covid and its aftermath have been the most significant learning curves for most of us as the pandemic and its effects took many lives and cost businesses. Yet, the crisis forced most firms to realign and innovate.As a third-generation business leader, I believe today’s business climate faces unprecedented challenges and lacks confidence. Overcrowding in markets due to similar imports and products manufactured much above the demand have resulted in supply glut. The central bank’s abrupt and overly conservative policy precaution has severely hampered businesses with no time to align with an overbearing regulation post-Covid, which gradually was loosened, but the damage had already been done.The volatile interest rate makes long-term planning frustrating and challenging, especially while planning and projecting your business year-on-year. This is still prevalent in doing business today. The government’s budget spending has always been poor, and it’s the same now. Persistent underutilisation of budgets hampers demand and has left Nepal behind in regional infrastructure development. Multi-party governments contribute to policy corruption and instability by creating unclear and conflicting policies. Our business community takes advantage where it fits, frustrating and damaging our economy. The cost of doing business has shot up significantly due to labour costs and delayed payments from the market and the state, creating additional financial strain.To invigorate the business climate, it is time for the government systems to become more digitised and faceless, with less bureaucracy at every step and a focus on policy clarity. The business community must be held accountable and motivated to contribute rather than feel beleaguered. All stakeholders must unite and bring transformational changes in Nepal, a country blessed with nature and immense human potential.The country’s economy is not in sound health. How is the Panchakanya Group doing?We have faced and adapted to numerous political, geopolitical, and natural disasters or the pandemic’s challenges throughout our industrial journey. Each setback has been a learning experience, helping us consolidate and sustain our operations.The aftermath of Covid-19 severely impacted Nepal's business landscape, including our group. While the pandemic was challenging, the subsequent financial policies deepened the difficulties. The restrictive and abrupt policy measures made navigating a strained economy even trickier, damaging businesses and slowing overall economic recovery. However, the crisis taught us invaluable lessons, compelling us to adapt and realign our strategies to survive and sustain.In my 19 years with the group, I have never witnessed an economy as stagnant and challenging as it is today, both financially and morally. The prolonged economic slump has dampened people’s hopes and drives to grow and their vision of national prosperity anytime soon.For the Group, sales have shrunk, and capacity utilisation has decreased significantly. Frequent and unpredictable policy changes in industry regulations and financial frameworks have kept us on edge.The lack of political stability and the prioritisation of politics over economic development has eroded confidence in the government and its ability to foster economic growth. The road ahead is uncertain, but our resilience and adaptability, built over five decades, will guide us forward.Since Nepal started exporting iron and steel to India, how is the demand in the Indian market? What difficulties is the company facing in the export process?Nepal's iron and steel industry makes various products, but only a few are manufactured locally for export. Among the prominent exports are corrugated sheets, some household items, and wire products, though the volume of other exports remains negligible. Panchakanya Stainless Steel tanks have also entered the export market, with small quantities being sent to India. Efforts are underway to expand this market and increase export volumes.In 2022, the government introduced an incentive scheme to promote exports, mainly targeting steel and cement industries with an 8 percent export incentive. This policy generated significant enthusiasm among manufacturers. Cement exports to India have been highly successful due to Nepal's abundant raw material, making production and export viable. However, steel exports have faced challenges. For instance, following the introduction of the incentive, only three truckloads of steel rebars were exported in 2022.The challenges in exporting steel and iron products stem from several factors. Nepal relies heavily on raw material imports from India and third countries, making production costs high. Additionally, the industry is hindered by poor electricity infrastructure, unreliable supply, rising labour costs, fluctuating interest rates, and unstable government policies, all of which making large-scale exports unfeasible.Under the Nepal-India trade treaty, Nepali products receive preferential treatment for export to India, provided they meet the requirement of at least 30 percent local and Indian value addition if the raw material originates from third countries. Furthermore, certain products must obtain Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification to qualify for export. While exporting to India is generally hassle-free, the competitiveness and cost-efficiency of Nepali industries remain critical factors. Unfortunately, these industries face numerous uncertainties, limiting their ability to capitalise on export opportunities.As a multiple manufacturing group, how is the company working on environmentally sustainable manufacturing practices? What are your plans for that?Panchakanya Group has always been and will remain deeply committed to integrating environmentally sustainable practices into its manufacturing processes. We focus on minimising our environmental footprint throughout every stage of our product life cycle while maintaining operational efficiency. We have consistently adopted green, clean, and lean practices across all our manufacturing units in Nepal, such as energy-efficient technologies. We use advanced process equipment to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, maximise raw material usage, and minimise waste.We have adopted an online automatic air-oil lubrication system that drastically reduces lubricant consumption, minimises discharge, and ensures eco-friendly operations. We adopt an automatic excess oxygen control system. This technology optimises combustion, reduces pollution, and minimises material wastage.Our commitment to the \"3R Policy\" (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) ensures maximum production efficiency while minimising waste. Additionally, we practice zero air, water, and electricity leakage in our manufacturing processes. We use only premium raw materials such as prime billets and virgin plastic to enhance output, improve quality, and reduce process losses and waste.In October 2024, we achieved a significant milestone by becoming Nepal’s first company to receive the GreenPro Type-1 Ecolabel for Panchakanya Steel. This certification recognises products that meet the highest standards of environmentally friendly practices. We take pride in being the greenest manufacturing facility, reducing our carbon footprint through green initiatives and planting over 4,500 trees in and around our industrial complex in Kotihawa, Bhairahawa.We aim to expand and enhance our green movement through several initiatives like expanding our existing 194 kW solar facility to over 1MW across plants and offices, planting more trees in available spaces to support the environment, adopting eco-friendly raw materials and energy solutions, encouraging digital practices to reduce paper usage and achieving zero water wastage by reusing recycled water.We aim to explore alternative fuels and the latest technologies to minimise environmental impact further, reduce waste, and increase efficiency.How does the company align with the UN sustainable development goals?Panchakanya Group has significantly aligned its operations with the UN SDGs. Key initiatives include creating jobs to combat poverty, ensuring productive and decent employment opportunities at its units, promoting sustainable consumption and responsible production, investing in environmentally friendly technologies, and prioritising the development of green products. These efforts showcase the group’s commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility.Further reinforcing its dedication, the Panchakanya Group contributes to five significant causes through its CSR arm, the Panchakanya Foundation. These initiatives include environmental protection, education, skill development, health and sanitation, and preserving culture and heritage.Why is there not a single woman on your company’s board?Panchakanya Group is deeply committed to fostering diversity and inclusion at all levels of its organisation. It takes pride in the rich diversity represented across its workforce, encompassing gender, culture, and religion.As a family-owned business, the group has been evolving, transitioning from traditional, family-centric management practices to a more professional and structured approach to governance. While the current leadership framework, shaped during the early stages of the company’s foundation and growth, does not yet include female representation at the board level, the group acknowledges the importance of gender diversity in leadership roles.We are optimistic about embracing broader inclusivity, including more excellent female representation in decision-making. This commitment reflects its forward-thinking approach to fostering a culture that supports equal opportunities, aligns with global best practices, and promotes sustainable and inclusive growth for all. \nAbout seven in 10 people in the country are facing health issues because of smog with the most common symptoms being cough, flu and breathing difficulties, according to a report by international insights firm Ipsos.The recent smog situation was declared a “calamity” in Punjab last month. According to the international Air Quality Index Scale, an index value of 300 or higher results is “hazardous” to health and Pakistan has regularly tipped over 1,000 on the scale.Around two million people visited medical facilities across Punjab with breathing problems and other respiratory diseases in a month as record-breaking smog choked the province.The Ipsos survey, titled “Smog in Pakistan: Awareness, Perceptions and Practices” and dated November 26, was conducted from Nov 18 to 22 using computer-assisted telephone interviews with a sample of 1,000 people from all four provinces and Islamabad.In its first section on people’s awareness and experience with smog, data showed that eight in 10 people, around 79 per cent of the sample size, experienced smog over the last month, with 100pc of the sample in Lahore experiencing it.It also revealed that 68pc people reported having smog-related health issues with 71pc in urban areas and 67pc in rural.The survey also highlighted the effect of smog on daily life, stating, “Over one-third Pakistanis found their daily household activities, work life, and social events being affected by smog.”It further said that Punjab was the worst hit among all provinces, adding that Lahore and Rawalpindi were most affected.According to the second section on people’s beliefs and perceptions, when asked about the primary cause of smog, 70pc of respondents said vehicular emissions, 63pc said industrial smoke and 37pc said waste burning. About 31pc chose brick kilns and 30pc crop burning, followed by one in five who believed it was the “wrath of God”.The data showed that 44pc of the people saw a lack of public cooperation and 37pc believed enforcement of law as the barriers in combating smog and air pollution.In the last section on actions and behaviours, the data showed that eight out of 10 people agreed that they needed to play their part in combatting smog. It also said that men, elderly and highly educated Pakistanis were more willing to cooperate, indicating that those who were more informed were likely to take responsibility.When asked to choose personal actions to reduce smog, 48pc said they were ready to switch to walking, 31pc chose public transport, 29pc chose bicycles and 10pc opted for new/hybrid electric vehicles.The report stated that out of 796 people who owned vehicles, “nine in 10 Pakistanis are ready to cooperate if they were asked to repair their vehicles and get certification from the government — a clear sign for the government to play its part in this regard.”According to the survey, three in five people were satisfied with their provincial government’s approaches to battling smog. However, it found that satisfaction decreased as the education level increased, which raised concerns about the relevance, priority and effectiveness of the government’s strategies in addressing smog.-In Association with ANN \nAmid a decline in temperatures, the number of people suffering from influenza and other respiratory ailments has risen. Hospitals treating respiratory patients say there has been an increase in flu and other respiratory illnesses compared to a few days ago.“A rise in cases of respiratory illnesses during winter or at the time of season change is not uncommon,” said Dr Ram Hari Chapagain, a senior consultant paediatrician at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. “Parents should not take these problems lightly, as children can sometimes develop severe symptoms.”Seasonal influenza is also highly contagious. It mainly affects the lungs and spreads quickly in communities. Its symptoms include fever, cough, body aches, and in some cases, vomiting and diarrhoea, and pneumonia.Pneumonia, an infection of the lungs caused by various types of bacteria, viruses and fungi, is the leading cause of death among children under five in Nepal. It kills more children annually than malaria, tuberculosis and HIV combined. According to the World Health Organisation, pneumonia accounts for 15 percent of under-five mortality.Doctors say pneumonia caused by bacteria is deadlier than that caused by viruses, and children under five and people above 65 years of age are highly vulnerable to the disease.Thousands of people across the country contract pneumonia every year. The average cost of hospitalisation for pneumonia is Rs13,250, which is nearly half the average monthly household expenses in Nepal, a study by Pneumo Nepal shows.The study—which was carried out at Patan Hospital, Kanti Children's Hospital, Mission Hospital in Palpa, Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj, and BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences—shows that unexpected medical costs often push families into poverty.Doctors warn that if seasonal influenza is left untreated, it can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Doctors say seasonal influenza affects not only children but also comorbid and elderly people equally.Although Nepal has no system in place to track influenza infections, severity, and deaths from influenza viruses, many people get severe infection from the disease, according to them.“We don’t know exactly how many people get infected, develop severe symptoms, or succumb to seasonal influenza each year in Nepal, as we do not maintain detailed records,” said Dr Anup Subedee, an infectious disease expert. “But the fact is small children, elderly people and those with underlying conditions are highly vulnerable.”Experts say most children recover within a few days of infection, but the virus could be severe to elderly people and those with underlying conditions.“The number of people suffering from seasonal flu, or influenza, has risen of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The increased flow of patients at pharmacies also indicates a rise in influenza cases.”Doctors say the number of people infected with seasonal influenza could be far more than recorded, as not all cases reach hospitals and undergo testing. Sometimes, even doctors do not think it necessary to carry out testing as there is no specific treatment for the infection.The seasonal influenza virus causes respiratory complications, mainly affecting the lungs. Experts say early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection and complications. Patients recover early if treated promptly. However, the severity of the disease and deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time.“Those who can afford to pay for influenza shots should get inoculated themselves along with children, elderly and people with comorbidities,” said Pun. “The influenza vaccine prevents severe infections.” \nThe Ministry of Health and Population has decided to inspect medical bills issued by health facilities following growing complaints from patients and their families about exorbitant charges, particularly in private hospitals. Patients and their relatives have also complained that private hospitals and medical colleges often do not inform them about fees at the time of treatment, only to impose excessive charges during discharge, according to officials.“We have received several complaints from patients and their relatives about the excessive charges by health facilities, and such complaints are growing every day,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesperson for the ministry. “We have already directed all health facilities, including medical colleges, to publish their fee structures on their websites.”Officials said Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel himself expressed concern about these growing complaints and instructed officials to regulate the charges.As per the ministry’s circular, health facilities must disclose outpatient department charges, bed fees, surgery charges, and lab fees, among other things.“We have also requested health agencies under provincial and local governments to regulate health facilities,” said Budhathoky. “They are requested to check if patients are being overcharged by health facilities.”Health officials said they are also planning to audit doctors’ prescriptions to see whether unnecessary medicines and tests are being prescribed. For this, the ministry plans to seek help from professional councils such as the Nepal Medical Council, the Nepal Pharmacy Council, and other agencies concerned.Experts say most ailments can be treated with medicines costing just a few hundred rupees, but some doctors force patients to buy vitamin supplements costing thousands of rupees. Patients and their relatives have also lodged complaints with the ministry about doctors' alleged wrongdoings and collusion with health facilities. They also complained that some hospitals force patients to undergo unnecessary tests costing high fees.Officials at the health ministry hope that an audit of doctors’ prescriptions will help address patients' complaints and grievances. Prescription audit is a systematic analysis and is in practice in many countries across the globe. It is carried out to find errors in doctors’ prescriptions and improve patient care.Officials say the decision to carry out a prescription audit was made to discourage malpractices involving doctors, pharmacists, importers, drug manufacturers, and hospitals.Under pressure from hospitals, patients are often made to undergo unnecessary and costly tests or are kept admitted in hospitals longer than necessary.An official at the ministry, asking not to be named since he is not authorised to speak to the media, said the Department of Drug Administration has banned certain vitamin supplements prescribed by doctors and sold openly in the market in combinations with specified solutions and agents.Some doctors and dispensaries have been taking undue advantage of poor patients, forcing them to buy additional vitamin supplements, the official said, adding that most patients are unaware and don’t ask if the supplements are necessary.Medical experts say that vitamin supplements are only needed in specific conditions, but most doctors prescribe them unnecessarily.Experts hope the prescription audit will help minimise irrational prescribing, improper dispensing, unnecessary testing and the practice of taking undue advantage of ailing patients. \nMalaysia should introduce pneumococcal vaccines for adults and high-risk groups following the steady rise in pneumonia-related deaths, say health experts.While pneumococcal vaccination is already part of the National Immunisation Programme for children, they said there is no such programme yet for adults, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions.Federation of Private Medical Practitioners’ Associations Malaysia president Dr Shanmuganathan Ganeson said Malaysia should integrate this vaccine as it has great public health benefits.“Many countries have successfully reduced pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality by integrating pneumococcal vaccines. Malaysia should follow suit.“It will help reduce hospital admissions by preventing severe pneumonia and invasive diseases, decrease healthcare costs by minimising complications and intensive care needs, and promote herd immunity by lowering bacterial transmission to protect unvaccinated individuals.“Cost-effectiveness studies in other nations suggest that national-level vaccinations could have a long-term economic benefit alongside improved health outcomes,” he said in an interview yesterday.Calling pneumonia a “highly avoidable disease”, Dr Shanmuganathan noted a rise in pneumonia-related deaths, particularly in 2021, due to Covid-19.“Even after recovery, some individuals experienced secondary bacterial infections, further increasing pneumonia risks,” he added.He pointed out that strained healthcare capacity also delayed treatment for other respiratory conditions.At the same time, an ageing population and prevalent non-communicable diseases like diabetes and heart disease heightened pneumonia risks.“The rise of antibiotic-resistant strains like Streptococcus pneumoniae has complicated treatment.“Also, the lack of widespread adoption of the pneumococcal vaccine, especially among high-risk groups, leaves a significant portion of the population vulnerable,” he said.Dr Shanmuganathan said the pneumococcal vaccine effectively reduces the risk of severe pneumococcal disease.He added that the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) can prevent up to 80% of invasive diseases in children.“For the elderly and high-risk groups, the vaccine significantly lowers the risk of complications and death.“Its efficacy varies depending on the individual health status and the vaccine type – either the PCV or the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV).“Importantly, it offers protection against antibiotic-resistant strains of pneumococcus, addressing a growing concern.“Malaysians, especially high-risk groups, should get the pneumococcal vaccine available in hospitals and clinics.“This includes children under two, adults over 65, those with chronic diseases and the immunocompromised,” he said, adding that increasing the awareness of the benefits of the vaccine and its availability at most clinics is important.With pneumonia now the leading cause of death, Dr Shanmuganathan said it is essential to update the Covid-19 vaccination programme, focusing on new variants like XEC and vulnerable populations.He emphasised that a broader respiratory health strategy is needed, including promoting pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations and ensuring early diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections.“Private general practitioners should be kept informed of these developments.“The Health Ministry must remain proactive, despite diverting staff to address the doctor shortage in clinical sectors,” he said.Association of Private Hospitals Malaysia president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said while Covid-19 infections may have been reduced, influenza cases are rising, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) becoming more recognised as a significant infection.As such, he said the government should consider including pneumococcal vaccines in Malaysia’s national vaccination programme.The vaccines, he added, should also be made readily available at private medical facilities and selected clinics.“Such a programme should be introduced as it would help reduce morbidity and mortality, especially in the high-risk population.“Vaccines should be made widely available to reduce the cost and burden of treating illnesses,” he said.Dr Kuljit suggested that those in the high-risk group consider getting vaccinated to better protect themselves against pneumonia.He said private medical centres are currently using the latest vaccine, Vaxneuvance, which helps protect against 15 types of pneumococcus.The cost of pneumococcal vaccines ranges between RM280 and RM400, depending on the type used.When asked, Dr Kuljit said the steady rise in pneumonia-related deaths in the past decade could be from the large number of high-risk populations due to the nation’s ageing population and those suffering from non-communicable diseases, which result in compromised immune systems.He also said the increase in cigarette and e-cigarette smoking could also be a factor in the rise of such cases.Smoking damages the cilia (tiny hair-like structures) in the respiratory tract that help clear pathogens and debris.“This dysfunction can lead to a higher risk of respiratory infections, including pneumonia,” he said.-In Association with ANN \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral's background in environmental science and artistic sensibility imbue her baking creations with unique offerings from jams to cakes, advocating for a zero-waste policy while sharing three easy-to-bake recipes.\nAmidst Kathmandu's urban sprawl, the historic village of Khokana preserves its ancient architecture, temples, and mustard oil mills, providing a glimpse into Nepal's medieval past and the resilience of its cultural traditions.\nA woman's journey to Everest Base Camp amidst changing climate and personal challenges, leading to a transformative experience and a reflection on life's meaning, limits, and value of existence.\nA group of journalists embarked on a 1,000-kilometer tour of Sri Lanka, visiting heritage sites, religious monuments, and scenic landscapes, while exploring the challenges and recovery of its tourism industry in the wake of recent economic and political struggles.\nVarious cultural and natural attractions in Nepal, including Mundhum Trek, Janaki Mandir, Kuri Village, Annapurna Base Camp, Bardiya National Park, Khaptad National Park, and Limi Valley, offer unique experiences and stunning landscapes.\nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nAmateur Rahul BK won the Surya Nepal Central Open, the first event under Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, at the par-72 Gokarna Golf Club on Thursday.BK carded 5-under 67 in the fourth and final round for a total score of 12-under 276.He registered a one-stroke victory over overnight leader Toran Bikram Shahi to claim maiden career title.BK also bagged the amateur section title with a five-stroke victory over Nepal number one amateur Sadbhav Acharya.BK, who began the day four strokes behind, carded 4-under 32 on the front nine to catch Shahi, who took the turn at even-par 36.

He was later charged with espionage.“Sentencing Yuyu to seven years in prison on no evidence declares to the world the bankruptcy of the justice system in China,” Dong’s family said in a statement provided to Reuters.“Today’s verdict is a grave injustice not only to Yuyu and his family but also to every freethinking Chinese journalist and every ordinary Chinese committed to friendly engagement with the world.”The family added that in the court judgment, Japanese diplomats whom Dong met were “specifically named as agents of an ‘espionage organisation,’ which is the Japanese embassy in Beijing”.Dong’s conviction implied every Chinese citizen would be “expected to know that the Chinese government may consider those embassies to be ‘espionage organisations’”, it said, causing a chilling effect.Police guarded the court on Friday, with seven police cars parked nearby, and journalists were asked to leave the area. A US diplomat said they had been barred from attending the hearing.Dong has been detained in a Beijing prison since a closed-court hearing in July 2023, the press club said in September.“Chinese authorities must reverse this unjust verdict, and protect the right of journalists to work freely and safely in China,” said Beh Lih Yi, Asia program manager at the Committee to Protect Journalists.“Dong Yuyu should be reunited with his family immediately.”Dong regularly had in-person exchanges with diplomats from various embassies and journalists.The Japanese diplomat he met, one of two he had regularly met in the past, was also detained for several hours, spurring a complaint from Japan's foreign ministry.At the time, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the diplomat was engaged in activities “inconsistent with their capacity” in China. The diplomat was later released.A Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 2007, Dong was a visiting scholar and visiting professor at Keio University and Hokkaido University in Japan, his family said in a statement in April 2023.He joined the Guangming Daily, affiliated to the ruling Communist Party, in 1987, after graduating from Peking University law school, and was the deputy editor of its commentary section.He wrote opinion articles in Chinese media and liberal academic journals on topics from legal reforms to social issues, and co-edited a book promoting the rule of law in China.His articles advocated moderate reforms while avoiding direct criticism of President Xi Jinping.His family had initially kept news of his detention private in the hope that charges could be reduced or dropped, but were told in March 2023 that he would stand trial, they said in their statement.Non-government bodies (NGOs) advocating press freedom have called for his release, with more than 700 journalists, academics and NGO workers signing an online petition for him to be freed.“Dong Yuyu is a talented reporter and author whose work has long been respected by colleagues,” said Ann Marie Lipinski, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard.“We stand with many in hoping for his release and return to his family.”In February, a Beijing court handed a suspended death sentence to Australian writer and pro-democracy blogger, Yang Hengjun, on espionage charges. \nFifteen people have died and at least 100 more are missing after a landslide triggered by heavy rains buried dozens of homes across several villages in eastern Uganda, the prime minister’s office and police said on Thursday.The landslide occurred on Wednesday in Bulambuli district, about 300 km (190 miles) east of the capital Kampala.At least 40 households were completely buried, the Uganda Red Cross Society said in a statement, while others were partially damaged.“We have 15 dead and fears are that there are many more bodies still buried,” said Charles Odongtho, spokesman for the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) which overseas disaster response work.He added that more than 100 people were still missing across eight villages.“We are shocked that it was this devastating,” Odongtho said. He said all bridges in the area had been swept away and roads inundated by water.Police said that 113 people were missing and that impassable roads were preventing vehicles, including ambulances, from conducting rescue operations.Uganda has been hit by unusually heavy rainfall since October that has triggered widespread flooding and landslides in some areas.On Tuesday torrential rains caused the River Nile, the main branch of which runs through Uganda, to burst its banks and flood a highway connecting Kampala to the country’s northwest, according to the Uganda National Roads Authority and police.Large swathes on the slopes of Ugandan mountains have been denuded of their forests and other vegetation cover for cultivable land, increasing the risk of landslides.The area where the landslide occurred is mountainous and has experienced similar disasters in the past, including an avalanche in 2010 that killed at least 80 people. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nChina celebrated the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Republic of China in 1959. A Nepali delegation also visited the country to participate in the celebrations conducted by the Chinese Communist Party. Surya Bahadur Thapa, a minister in the interim government formed by King Mahendra, led the Nepali delegation.At the end of Thapa’s sojourn to China, his Chinese interlocutors informed him that Chairman Mao would grant him a meeting. Thapa was advised to carry three messages to King Mahendra. First, Mao informed Thapa that the Chinese were not in a race with India to provide developmental assistance to Nepal. Second, he assured that China would not let anyone compromise issues related to Nepal’s sovereignty. Finally, Mao said that Thapa must advise the King to maintain good relations with India to ensure political stability in Nepal. Leading a semi-retired life half a decade later, the octogenarian Thapa was curiously observing the evolving politics of the peace process, which marked a gargantuan shift in Nepali society. Pushpa Kamal Dahal had just resigned as prime minister over his failed attempt to depose the army chief in 2010. At this point, he seemed hellbent on soliciting China’s support to return to power. After losing power, Dahal visited the northern neighbour with a plan to counter India. This was Dahal playing the China card in Nepali politics in the early phase of the peace process. After returning to Nepal from his China visit in 2011, Dahal’s trusted China hand Agni Sapkota declared China’s prophetic advice to the visiting Maoist delegation: To mend ties with India for stability in Nepal. Thapa observed that great powers seldom change track at provocations insinuated by political frictions of Nepali leaders. He also witnessed that China had upheld its tested Nepal policy for over 50 years since different regimes in Nepal continued with their commitment to the One China Policy.Interestingly, China’s ambitious global outreach in recent times has compelled analysts to examine whether its policy is evolving towards deeper engagement in Nepal. For instance, many analysts have characterised the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a geopolitical initiative that aims to provide strategic leverage over other countries. BRI is a signature foreign policy of President Xi Jinping, which was announced in 2013 to connect China closer to the world through infrastructure and investment projects. Unsurprisingly, Beijing would want Nepal to be a part of President Xi’s ambitious foreign policy gambit. While Nepal signed the BRI Framework Agreement in 2017, Beijing is now pressing Kathmandu to move forward with the BRI implementation plan. Given the heightened geopolitical rivalry, including in the SAARC region, the BRI implementation plan was bound to face scrutiny in Nepal. The fact that the document has not been made public and the details of the plan remain elusive gives way to rising speculations on the negative aspects of the proposed plan. In a democracy, process and content fundamentally determine the course of bilateral or multilateral treaties. As in Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the proposed implementation plan should have been made public to allow for debates, enhancing the understanding of the agreement. Also, the government, in the Parliament’s absence, could have called an all-party meeting or referred the plan to the international committee of the Lower House of Parliament. MCC received bipartisan support since Nepal’s parliament endorsed it after many rounds of deliberations and amendments. Therefore, as Nepal builds on its relationship with its neighbours, the political leadership in Kathmandu should provide space to open debates on the policy choices it intends to initiate. More importantly, Nepal must strive to achieve bipartisan support on critical issues impacting its external relations, especially with its neighbours. As Nepal’s economy struggles due to political instability, bilateral and multilateral funding will continue to play a pivotal role in fueling growth. However, there are genuine concerns regarding BRI that should be clarified. It is widely reported that BRI has led to unsustainable debt in several countries, and the bad debt incurred through its funded projects has seriously impacted their economies. Sri Lanka and Pakistan are perfect examples in the region, illustrating that large infrastructure projects with high interest rates plunge the economy into a crisis with high debt-to-GDP ratios. This situation leads to unstainable levels, eventually producing a balance-of-payment deficit and a large-scale financial crisis that triggered protests in Sri Lanka.Nepal must prudently select projects that it can repay, and the borrowing rates must be on par with what the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank Group offer for financing infrastructure projects in the country. In simple words, we must bite what we can chew in terms of envisioning big-ticket infrastructure projects that require enormous amounts of capital. Another aspect of the implementation plan that was criticised was how the plan covers an entire range of areas of cooperation, including law enforcement and other areas unrelated to infrastructure development. Any imbalance in Nepal’s foreign policy will be watched closely by Nepal’s friends on the global stage. Coincidently, Donald Trump’s NSC designate recently visited Kathmandu, which reinforces Nepal’s geopolitical importance. The BRI implementation plan, in its current speculated form, has broader strategic and geopolitical implications. There seems to be no clarity on the requirement of the plan for BRI projects, as countries worldwide haven’t signed it. Therefore, the rationale for Nepal signing the agreement is largely questionable at this stage. At all costs, Nepal must avoid sending a signal that it has chosen a particular geopolitical camp. Advocates of the implementation plan mention that this is only an in-principal document. If so, the political leadership of Nepal must evaluate that by conceding Nepal’s principled position on seeking grants or concessional loans at the World Bank and the ADB rates. Observers will question the neutrality of the in-principal stand taken to endorse the document. Those opposing the plan in its present form will continue to argue that once a country loses on principle, what else is there to lose?Nepali politicians and policymakers at the strategic level should realise Beijing has moved ahead from the traditional way of looking at Nepal. Nepal should assess whether China has shifted the goalpost and its commitments by introducing a non-essential implementation plan as one of its priorities—from a geopolitical perspective—and what it means for the country. Moreover, Kathmandu’s position should be to seek the implementation of past announcements and promises. Lastly, Sino-Nepal relations are of historical importance, and therefore, they cannot be reduced to dividing political forces in Nepal. Nepali politicians need to improvise their foreign policy positioning by understanding that state-to-state relations are becoming more transactional and that each nation will aim to expand its leverage over the other. It is time an aspiring Nepali woke up to the reality of cutthroat competition for influence in international relations.  \nGreen finance isn’t a foreign concept for Nepal or its banking industry. Nepal’s financial sector's investment has been by default in the hydropower sector for years. However, these investments lacked clear definitions and parameters. With Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) recent introduction of a comprehensive green finance taxonomy, that is about to change. The Nepali banking sector is expected to undergo substantive and sustainable changes, redefining investment standards.This new taxonomy marks an important step towards instituting clear provisions on green investments. It serves as a structured system to classify sustainable economic activities, offering local and international investors the market clarity they need to make informed, sustainable decisions.As Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari noted, “The adoption of a dedicated green finance taxonomy is crucial given the pivotal role of private and public finance in tackling climate change.” This is an important step toward creating a well-defined green finance landscape in Nepal. It helps reduce ambiguity and strengthens Nepal’s position on the global map of sustainable finance.The core of a green finance taxonomy is clarity. By defining what “green” means in Nepal, NRB’s taxonomy guides banks and investors on where to direct their funds. Without this clarity, “greenwashing”—where investments falsely claim to be eco-friendly—can occur. This new framework reduces that risk by setting clear standards, giving investors confidence that their money supports genuinely sustainable projects.The taxonomy also prioritises green finance for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and focuses on gender. NRB’s structure closely follows international best practices, aiming to make sustainable finance accessible, transparent and essential to Nepal’s economy. It brings multiple benefits such as reducing environmental risks, strengthening the energy sector and supporting the financial sector’s shift to a green economy.Benefits for banksThe green taxonomy is a significant enabler for Nepali banks. It provides a clear and structured system of classifying green projects, making it easier to create financial products that support environmental goals. This shift helps banks direct funds more effectively into green sectors. Previously, banks invested in green areas without a standard framework; now, they have official guidelines to align with sustainable and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards.Moreover, this taxonomy is designed to support projects on various scales, focusing on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and smaller-scale adaptation projects. This is especially relevant for Nepal, where small businesses form a substantial portion of the economy and often face challenges accessing finance for sustainable projects. By enabling banks to tailor green finance products for MSMEs, the taxonomy opens up new pathways for these businesses to contribute to Nepal’s green transition.More FDINepal’s clear green finance framework isn’t just a boost for its banks; it’s a signal to the world that the country is open and committed to sustainable foreign investment. Global investors increasingly prioritise sustainability and seek out countries with strong green finance policies. NRB's new taxonomy signals to the international community that Nepal is serious about transparency and environmental responsibility, showing an appealing climate for foreign direct investment (FDI).As green finance standards continue to tighten worldwide, NRB’s taxonomy places Nepal on par with international benchmarks. This allows for global investors to back up Nepali projects. By aligning with global expectations, Nepal becomes a destination for the kind of FDI that promotes both economic growth and environmental care.NRB’s leadership in developing the green taxonomy has been impressive. The bank has taken thoughtful steps to ensure the taxonomy is comprehensive, inclusive and tailored specifically to Nepal’s needs. Working with central banks across the region for peer review has further strengthened its credibility among foreign investors.This taxonomy will open the door to financial products that support clean energy, sustainable farming, waste management and more. These financial tools are essential for managing climate risks and building resilience for a country like Nepal, where environmental challenges are closely linked to economic growth.Perhaps the most impactful aspect of NRB’s green taxonomy is its forward-looking approach. This isn’t just about guiding today’s investments into sustainable projects; it’s about setting a strong foundation for a resilient green economy in the future. The taxonomy encourages banks to consider both climate mitigation and adaptation, ensuring that Nepal’s financial system can support a sustainable future in a world facing increasing environmental challenges.But successful implementation of the green taxonomy is not without challenges. Currently, the banking sector lacks the capacity to evaluate green projects. In addition, the regulatory framework must evolve to dissuade greenwashing. Ensuring sustained coordination between government agencies, development partners and the private sector to realise the true intent of this policy is a must. In a market like Nepal's, there is a need for a concessional and blended finance mechanism to reduce the cost of borrowing and the risk for financial institutions. Establishing clear standards enables local and international investors to fund projects that align with Nepal’s environmental and economic priorities. With this move, NRB has shown true leadership on the climate front, setting a regional precedent in sustainable finance. \nThe formal implementation of federalism in Nepal began after the three-tier elections in 2017. As it completes its seventh year, the journey to effective implementation remains fraught with challenges. The recent Kantipur Conclave (November 13-14) brought together the chief ministers of all provinces to discuss the progress, hurdles and opportunities in federal governance in a session titled “Face to Face with Chief Ministers”. Their insights shed light on the practical realities of federalism, revealing gaps in legislation, administrative autonomy, fiscal federalism and intergovernmental relations.Chief ministers highlighted several shared concerns about federalism's implementation. Hikmat Karki, Chief Minister of Koshi Province, said that provinces are given a “treasure bag without money,” referring to the lack of fiscal autonomy. He pointed out that while Koshi Province has made progress, such as reforming the vehicle licensing system, it still faces significant barriers due to the absence of enabling legislation and institutional support from the federal government. Similarly, Satish Kumar Singh, Chief Minister of Madhesh Province, echoed the frustration over the gap between rights and resources. He compared Nepal’s federalism with India’s, highlighting how Indian states are empowered with resources and authority to implement their mandates. Singh called for more clarity in resource allocation and legislative framework and emphasised the need for regular evaluation and accountability for civil servants.The struggle for autonomy and functionality is not confined to these provinces. Chief Minister Bahadur Singh Lama of Bagmati Province pointed to a lack of laws governing exclusive and shared powers as a fundamental issue, despite his province achieving over 70 percent budget utilisation. Surendra Raj Pandey of Gandaki Province articulated similar concerns. He metaphorically described how federalism is stuck in a “2G framework” while governance demands have moved into a “5G era”. Pandey emphasised that the delayed enactment of critical federal laws, such as the Federal Police Act and the Education Act, prevents provinces from functioning effectively. He criticised the centralised mindset of political leaders and bureaucrats, which stymies the progress of federalisation.Acting Chief Minister Bhumeswar Dhakal of Lumbini Province stressed that provinces are the backbone of federalism and pivotal for connecting government to the people. He expressed frustration over the federal government’s failure to release grants on time and clarify shared powers. Meanwhile, Yam Lal Kandel of Karnali Province focused on the need for equitable resource allocation. He criticised the centralised governance model, arguing that it perpetuates disparities between provinces. Kandel called for timely legislation and structural alignment to enable provinces to fulfil their constitutional mandates and address development gaps.Kamala Bahadur Shah, the Chief Minister of Sudurpaschim Province, shed light on bureaucratic resistance. He shared an anecdote where a government secretary denied provincial authority but exerted control when operating in Kathmandu. According to Shah, this duality highlights the reluctance among bureaucrats to embrace federalism. He urged leaders to adopt a federal mindset and foster collaboration to strengthen governance at all levels.Despite challenges, chief ministers also shared some successes and opportunities. For example, the vehicle licensing reform in Koshi Province and Bagmati Province’s high budget utilisation demonstrate that provinces can deliver tangible results when given authority and resources. However, these isolated successes cannot mask the persisting systemic issues across provinces.At the Kantipur Conclave, their concerns were similar to those raised during programmes organised in all provincial capitals by the Federalism and Localization Centre, facilitated by the chief ministers’ offices in September 2024.Federalism is a shared responsibility, and its success depends on the collective efforts of federal, provincial and local governments. Chief ministers emphasised that the federal government must lead by example, demonstrating a commitment to federalisation and creating an enabling environment for provinces to thrive.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli also addressed the conclave, emphasising the government's commitment to enacting laws that will provide reasonable powers to the provinces in line with the constitution. In response to concerns raised by the chief ministers regarding the lack of essential resources, such as financial autonomy and police powers, Oli acknowledged that the federal government has yet to enact laws that would fully empower the provinces. However, he assured that such laws would be made to ensure that provinces receive the rights they are entitled to.Prime Minister Oli's message, however, was not entirely encouraging for the provinces. He suggested that rather than focusing on “Sanduk ra Banduk” (fiscal resources and police authority), provinces should prioritise working with ideas and enthusiasm. Drawing on the example of Mahatma Gandhi, who achieved monumental change without weapons or fiscal resources, Oli emphasised that “thoughts” and “enthusiasm” are key to progress, suggesting that provinces should cultivate a mindset of innovation and dedication rather than waiting for more powers to be granted.While his statement reflected optimism and a call for action, it highlighted a more cautious approach toward empowering the provinces, contrasting with the urgency the provincial leaders expressed.The insights shared by the chief ministers at the conclave serve as a roadmap for strengthening federalism in Nepal. Their voices underscore the need for clear laws, robust institutions and a commitment to federalisation and inclusivity. Addressing legislative gaps, empowering provinces with resources and authority and fostering a decentralised mindset are critical steps toward realising the promise of federalism.As Nepal navigates its federal journey, these lessons must guide its path toward more effective and equitable governance. By tackling the systemic issues collectively, Nepal can fulfil the promise of federalism and build a governance system that serves its diverse population. The conclave provided a platform for these critical discussions, and it is now up to the stakeholders to act on these insights and strengthen the federal framework. Federalism in Nepal remains a work in progress, but with concerted efforts, it holds the potential to transform governance and empower provinces to become engines of development and inclusivity. \nThe annual United Nations climate summit, COP29, where nations discuss the future of climate, wrapped up last Sunday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Even as nations fought hard to reach a fair deal, the conference ended with a new climate finance target or New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) of at least $300 billion a year by 2035. Some representatives stood from their seats and applauded; however, delegates from developing nations felt insulted and labelled the $300 billion a “paltry sum” as it is simply not enough to address their mounting climate concerns. Even though the pledge has tripled from the previous target of $100 billion, which expires at the end of this year, it is less than the $400-$900 billion that many developing countries demanded from wealthy nations. The NCQG serves as a financial tool for justice, holding developed nations accountable for a climate crisis that disproportionately affects poorer countries. Yet, the escalating climate crisis each year has not been matched by a proportional increase in climate finance to address it. According to a 2024 OECD/IEA report, only $179 billion of the $1,265 billion tracked in global climate mitigation and adaptation finance from 2021-22 went to developing nations, with just $30 billion allocated to the least developed countries (LDCs).Developing nations like ours need this fund to adapt to climate change as they progress. Climate change impacts are not equally distributed. Nepal is one of the most climate change-vulnerable countries globally, although it contributes a negligible 0.02 percent share of global carbon emissions. This means that the climate-induced disasters the nation is grappling with, like floods, droughts, heatwaves, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), and so on, are outcomes of global climate change, a crisis fueled mainly by the inaction of nations with substantial carbon footprints. This is the sad reality of several South Asian nations: By 2050, Bangladesh will lose 17 percent of its territory due to rising sea levels, around 90 percent of India lies in extreme heat danger zones, and Pakistan became the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change last year according to Global Climate Risk Index. Considering our susceptibility to climate change, platforms like COP are vital to inform the world about our experiences and demand the compensation we deserve. Nepal’s COP-29 priorities this year focused on safeguarding its mountains, ensuring promised climate finance, enhancing access to climate funds, and urging the expedited implementation of the loss and damage fund established last year. Under the leadership of President Ramchandra Paudel, Nepal conducted a high-level session on climate change, during which he talked about the impacts of the melting of snow in the mountains. Nepal’s participation in the previous iterations of the UN climate summit hasn’t been that impressive. Negotiating and presenting on such platforms require experience, research and preparation. More than anything, it demands sensitivity towards climate change, which our leaders seemingly do not possess. Besides setting an NCQG, this year’s COP also delivered global standards for carbon trading and mandated all 195 Paris signatories to announce more ambitious emission targets by February 2025. However, concerns over Donald Trump’s re-election as the US president overshadowed these developments at the summit. The US, even though it is the world’s second-largest emitter after China, withdrew from the Paris Agreement during Trump’s first term. Although climate finance this year did not meet the expectations of developing nations, it cannot be rejected, especially with the rise of right-wing politicians who are indifferent to the climate crisis. Regardless, Nepal must strengthen its domestic climate change policies and enhance its negotiating and communication skills internationally. It should also collaborate with other developing nations that are experiencing the negative impacts of climate change. It is time we stopped ignoring the elephant in the room.  \nKarnali Province has worryingly become synonymous with tragic road accidents, with deaths and injuries getting far too frequent. We aren’t even halfway through this fiscal year, and as many as 48 people have already died on Karnali’s roads. According to the Provincial Police Office in Surkhet, just in the second week of November, 17 accidents resulted in 12 fatalities and 132 injuries. And in the past five years, a total of 666 people in the province died for the same reason. This alarming data hints at systemic negligence and calls for immediate remedial action.Karnali’s rugged topography is well-known, presenting natural challenges to smooth transport. But the blame for these accidents cannot be attributed solely on the province’s layout. In areas with a limited number of vehicles, reckless bus operators overload them, which contributes to accidents. Recently, a five-seater jeep jam-packed with 32 people crashed at Raduneta of Palata Rural Municipality-3 in Kalikot district, killing seven and injuring 13 others. Moreover, the vehicle operators tend to deceive the police by asking some passengers to get off the bus at security check-posts so the overcrowding goes unnoticed. The passengers are left with no option but to accept such wretched conditions, often out of necessity. The vehicle operators also justify their actions by claiming they cannot bar people who want to get inside packed buses, especially on routes where public transport is scarce. Such problems could have been averted if the province had good roads and enough vehicles. The Karnali Highway was blacktopped eight years ago, but the asphalt has eroded in sections, making accidents more likely. Inaugurated in 1992 and operated in 2007, the state of the highway remains sub-par and inadequate to meet the province’s demands. Besides the Karnali Highway, Rapti, Mid-Hill Highway and other road sections also need upgrade and widening. Landslides during the monsoon obstruct these roads and pose danger to travellers. This absence of proper road infrastructure has not just affected the local people but also harmed Karnali’s tourism prospects and undercut its development aspirations. There isn’t much interest, either at the federal or provincial level, in improving the state of Karnali’s roads. The focus of elected officials seems to be to open new tracks on unstable soil just to show that development has ‘arrived’ in Karnali. The region’s challenges are examples of systemic neglect. While it is commendable that many remote areas are now connected by roads, these paths should also be relatively safe and easy to traverse. Given such a large number of deaths and injuries, the federal and provincial governments should prioritise road safety as a matter of urgency. Drivers, police and passengers—none of them can escape their responsibility while blaming the others for the accidents. They would all be better served if they joined hands to put pressure on governments to enhance the quality of roads and collaborate with the private sector to bring more vehicles to the province. Monitoring and supervision activities along the stretch of the Karnali Highway, where most accidents take place—from Bangesimal in Surkhet to Khalanga in Jumla—should be another priority. Nowhere in Nepal should people have to put their lives on the line while travelling for essential business.  \nPrime Minister and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli likes to project an image of a decisive leader. This much-valued leadership trait often works to his advantage. Yet when he makes decisions on the fly, it can backfire just as often. This past Friday, the UML held a mass gathering in the national capital in order to “raise awareness against anarchy”. Many found it curious that the party leading the national government would call for such a gathering: Shouldn’t the prime minister be focusing on delivery and leave all the protests and rallies to opposition forces? The real reason behind the rally, as party insiders put it, was the UML’s desire to “project strength” at a time of widespread public disenchantment. The rally and the eventual gathering at Durbar Marg, it was hoped, would send an unmistakable signal to other political forces that the party is still a potent force capable of mobilising big masses at short notice. Such a show of strength had apparently become vital after much smaller forces like the Rastriya Swatantra Party and even some troublemakers associated with Durga Prasai were seen hitting the streets in order to “sow anarchy”. The Friday event turned out to be dud. The party had expected at least 100,000 to turn up; the actual crowd was much smaller. In any case, Oli and other top UML leaders who addressed the Durbar Marg gathering had little of substance to say. For instance, the prime minister spent considerable time denouncing the RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane and his supposedly dubious character. This was rum as Lamichhane is currently in police custody and facing a series of criminal charges. Moreover, the RSP protests against Lamichhane’s arrest have already fizzled out. So, instead of promising no government intervention on investigations against Lamichhane and others arrested on charges of cooperatives fraud, why continue to hound a jailed and much-diminished political opponent? Whatever Oli’s intent, it betrayed a deep sense of insecurity vis-a-vis Lamichhane and even the smallest forces that have criticised his government leadership. This wasn’t a display of strength, either from Oli or the UML. It was rather an inadvertent show of weakness which the party’s political opponents will greatly relish. Any way you look at it, the gathering, organised on a weekday and at great inconvenience for commuters, was unnecessary, nay, a nuisance. Again, it is hard to read Oli, and perhaps whatever purpose he had in mind has been served. But most folks are left scratching their heads. The head of government, instead of governing and trying to silence his critics through delivery, is seen spewing venom against his political opponents at a rally that seemingly no one except him wanted. There is also a sense of unease among the people. Our prime minister and his party seem incapable of taking criticism and if someone raises a question, they will try to shout down the questioner. Ironically, the protest against anarchy itself turned out to be rather anarchic: Lacking a purpose, horribly organised and disturbing people’s daily lives.  \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is preparing to visit China in the first week of December. It will be his first bilateral visit after assuming the office in mid-July. Nepali prime ministers generally go to New Delhi first. Sudheer Sharma, former editor-in-chief of Kantipur daily, has recently published a pair of books on Nepal-China relations—‘Himalpari ko Huri’ and ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’. He also frequently writes on Nepal’s relations with its two big neighbours. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Sharma on the eve of Oli’s China visit. Prime Minister Oli is all set to visit China next month. Many find it curious that he decided to go to Beijing first before visiting New Delhi. How do you see this development?Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have given high priority to visits and engagements with our two neighbours–India and China. This is natural. Generally, the prime ministers first visited India and then went to China. I believe Prime Minister Oli tried to do the same. We see regular engagements with New Delhi at various levels. Prime Minister Oli had met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in the last week of September. In August, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India and met Prime Minister Modi and her counterpart S Jaishankar, among other key officials there. But Delhi has yet to extend the invitation to the prime minister. So he seems to have decided not to defer his foreign visits for long and chose to visit Beijing first. We have to see this in two perspectives. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and he is also going to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even in the past, Oli developed good relations with Chinese leaders. So, there are expectations that he may make the visit fruitful. An equally important concern is whether this visit impacts our relations with the southern neighbour India. I think the prime minister should focus on implementing the agreements reached during his previous visits to Beijing and during Chinese leaders’ Nepal visits. He should be mindful of not irking the southern neighbour while reaching any agreement with the northern one. I believe the prime minister is conscious of this.India often seems anxious about Chinese involvement in Nepal. Do you see any risk of this visit increasing the distance between Oli and India?Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited China first after he became prime minister in 2008. Even in the past, some Nepali prime ministers including Tanka Prasad Acharya went to China on their first official visit. This is not unusual. The two prime ministers—Oli and Modi—recently met in New York. India doesn’t seem ready to intensify bilateral engagements with Nepal immediately. So it is natural for the prime minister to increase engagements with China, without taking any steps that could provoke India. We should stop seeking Indian signals when dealing with China, and vice versa. We should maintain parallel relations with both the neighbours without antagonising any side.In this context, what should be the prime minister’s priorities during his China visit?We have to end our chronic problem of signing agreements and not implementing them. We make announcements and forget them. There are also some infrastructure projects China pledged to develop but there is little progress. So the prime minister should draw the Chinese leadership’s attention and press them to complete the projects on time. Some important projects such as Mugling-Pokhara and Narayanghat-Butwal road upgradation by the Chinese side have been slow, causing hardships to people. Even such issues should be communicated to the political level. Also, there are several commitments made by the Chinese government but left unimplemented. This creates an impression that China makes big promises but doesn’t keep them. Prime Minister Oli often highlights the Tokha-Chhahare road upgrade project under Chinese support but there is no satisfactory progress. Progress on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) on Nepal-China cross-border railway is unclear as well. Nepal expected some substantive support from China to make the Pokhara international airport financially feasible. Some concrete steps are needed to operate this airport. There are reports that the government has requested China to convert the loan taken to develop the airport into a grant and the prime minister will push for this during his visit. It will be an achievement if the prime minister succeeds in this. In the course of writing your recent books, you extensively interacted with Chinese officials and experts, as well as with their Nepali counterparts. What are the major factors delaying the projects? Is it lack of preparation on the Nepali side or is there any problem on the Chinese side?First, we [Nepalis] sign agreements but don’t work seriously to implement them. This is true in the case of agreements with other countries as well. We are negligent. Red tape is another problem. Third, China gives less priority to small countries like Nepal as it has so many big issues with other countries. We have to constantly follow up with them to speed things up. In the past, the two sides agreed to open more border points. This should be expedited. The people-to-people relations on the border areas were historically based on social interactions at the community level. People used to trade, marry those from the other side and interact in various ways. Of late, despite progress on infrastructure development, social engagement has been hindered. This should be rectified and new border points should be opened at Dolpa, Mustang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Taplejung, and Sankhuwasabha. We should think beyond the Capital-centric approach. This will help strengthen relations at the people’s level and give alternatives in our connectivity. We should put connectivity at the core of our relations with the two neighbours. In the past decade, we have made good progress in improving connectivity with India. A study report has been prepared on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway project. We are building an expressway linking Kathmandu and the southern belt of the country. Integrated check posts (ICPs) have come into operation along Nepal-India border points. Cross border electricity transmission lines have been built and we have increased energy trade with India. We have thus progressed in deepening connectivity with India. We lack reliable north-south highways. Therefore, the prime minister should make connectivity a major agenda of his China visit. Given the lacklustre performance of past projects, can we be optimistic about big cross-border infra projects under Chinese help?Nepal and China have committed to run some projects under the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) concept. A key component of this concept is to upgrade connectivity between Kathmandu and Kerung that includes roads as well as a railway. The concept also envisions operating other border points. The railway project requires more study and investment and needs to consider various other factors. For now, we should prioritise opening the aforementioned border points. The Korala border point at Mustang has huge potential. Nepal is making a road that connects Mustang with the Sunauli border point with India. Centuries ago, people from Banaras used to travel to Tibet via Mustang through this route. It can be revived and made a trilateral trade route between Nepal, India and China. Similarly, Limi in Humla, Olangchugola in Taplejung, among others places, can be developed as alternative routes. As far as Kerung-Kathmandu connection is concerned, let’s first give priority to building a reliable highway. The railway project should be developed with a broader understanding between Nepal, India and China. Beijing will develop such a big project only with the big Indian markets in mind. More importantly, there are some signs of improvements in India-China relations. We have to use this as an opportunity.There are differences in the way we work and the Chinese do and there are systemic and linguistic differences as well. These factors are often blamed for lack of progress in development activities carried out with Chinese support. Can Nepalis work closely with Chinese, just like we do with Indians?Until a decade ago, several projects developed under Indian support were left in limbo. In 2015, India imposed a blockade against Nepal and that sparked anti-India sentiment. Then, India expedited several projects. This drastic change became possible as the political leadership in India realised its mistake and showed the commitment to improve things.But the same thing is not happening with China because there is a “great wall” between Nepal and China when it comes to understanding each other. The Chinese haven’t understood Nepali context. The northern neighbour should be more open and liberal in helping Nepal. Second, Nepal should also stop approaching China only when our relations with India sour. We have left this impression on the Chinese psyche. First, we should be clear about what exactly we want from China, forge consensus among major political forces and hold talks with the Chinese leaders. Then, we should be equally committed to implementing the agreements reached this way. People now take announcements of building big projects under Chinese support as propaganda. Therefore, this time the prime minister should stress on pushing the pending projects. The prime minister should tell them that even the projects announced during President Xi’s visit have not progressed and that has created a bad impression of China in Nepal.There are some differences between the coalition partners—the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress—about the funding modality of projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). Do you think this may cause a problem?The UML wants to expedite the BRI projects while the Congress has insisted that we should accept only grants and not loans under the BRI. The prime minister should clear such dilemmas and come up with common views before he leaves for Beijing. Once they come up with a common view on such key issues, it will give a positive and strong message. The Chinese side will take it more seriously because the strong government led by the two largest parties can implement bilateral agreements.We have instances of Nepal’s political parties standing for and against important projects funded by other countries. This was seen in the case of the US-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and China’s BRI. Moreover, in the past, the Chinese leaders created an impression that they preferred working with communist parties and leaders. This is neither in the interest of Nepal nor of China.There are also discussions on signing the BRI implementation plan during the visit. What are the things Nepal should be careful about while signing BRI-related agreements?Trying to get grants instead of loans is in itself good. But there is no need to be prejudiced against the BRI per se. Nepal reportedly wants to include some points specifying waivers in specific projects. We should be very careful while signing project-based agreements. For instance, what will be the conditions and funding modality of a project, will it be developed under grants or loans etcetera. All our technical experts and other brains should be engaged while signing project-based agreements and specifying conditions and other nitty-gritty to ensure that we will not have unnecessary liability and debt burden in the future. Over time, Nepal has rightly adopted a steadfast position saying that we don’t join a strategic alliance proposed by any country. It stayed away from the US government’s State Partnership Programme (SPP) and China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI) as well as from India’s security umbrella. But we can’t be isolated in development initiatives. We have to take support from India, China, the US and other countries based on our needs.Do you think the Chinese side will show magnanimity on Nepal’s requests, for instance on waiving off the loan to develop Pokhara international airport?Though the Chinese ambassador to Nepal last year claimed the airport project to be under the BRI, the case is different because it was signed years before we joined the BRI. And, converting that loan into a grant is not a big deal for China. They should show magnanimity given the support we have been providing to China for a long time. If you see things historically, Nepal has helped China by suppressing Khampa revolt, preventing free Tibet movements on our soil and showing a steadfast commitment to One-China policy. China, which is now prosperous, should definitely show magnanimity and waive off loan of Pokhara airport. They shouldn’t see relations with Nepal through a purely transactional lens.In your book, you describe 2008 as a watershed after which the engagements between Nepal and China increased drastically. But why couldn’t we benefit from the northern neighbour in terms of development?The Chinese side looks more interested in increasing engagement. They like to showcase their development before foreigners. But more than lavish hospitality, we need substantive support from the neighbour, which has emerged as the world’s second-largest economy. But we should be clear about what we want from our engagements with China.  The Nepali side doesn’t present its proposals clearly. On certain issues, our politicians give mixed signals. This time, if this government of two largest parties reaches a certain agreement with China and remains committed to implement it, other forces can’t hinder it. The same approach can be replicated while dealing with India, the US, Japan or other friendly countries.Is difficult geography still a barrier in developing cross-border infrastructure projects and deepening relations between Nepal and China?In our textbooks we read that the Himalayan range is a natural barrier between the two countries. In my book ‘Bhikshu Byapar ra Bidroha’, I have explored and described how people from Nepal and northern India had been traversing through these mountains and there were interactions and engagements between the people in this part of the world since the 5th and 6th centuries. So, the mountains weren’t barriers even at that time. Now technology has made things easier. We have to think about how to connect with these two big economies. We have multiple east-west highways. Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries. \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nOn Friday the weather in the hilly areas of Koshi province is forecast to be partly cloudy while the rest of the country is to remain mainly fair.Tonight the weather is to remain partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi and Gandaki Province and mainly fair in the rest of the country.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe debut edition of the Nepal Premier League Twenty20 cricket tournament is set to kick off on Saturday with a festive atmosphere and with so much anticipation that it could write a new chapter in Nepali cricket.Billed as the ‘Festival of Himalayas’, the NPL has already attracted global interest, with the likes of former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan and New Zealand allrounder James Neesham, among other big cricketing names, set to light up the eight-team competition that will run until December 21.The involvement of Star Sports Network—a group of Indian television sports channels that also holds the rights of flagship tournaments like Indian Premier League, English Premier League, Wimbledon and ICC events—as the official broadcasting partner will now give the league a worldwide exposure.Partnership with Twenty-first Century Media (TCM) Sports—a sports management company that has managed Cricket World Cups, Asia Cups, IPL and other international events—is further evidence that the NPL aspires to evolve into one of the major cricketing events in the world.Organiser Cricket Association of Nepal appears determined to make the league a landmark event, aiming to propel Nepali cricket into an unprecedented era of growth and global recognition.“The organisation of the NPL is itself a big achievement for CAN and Nepali cricket,” CAN Spokesperson Chhumbi Lama told the Post.“For the first time, our domestic tournament will be broadcast worldwide, making the NPL the ideal platform to elevate Nepali cricket to the international stage,” Lama added. “The inaugural league could be a catalyst for Nepali cricket’s golden era.”CAN has laid out ambitious plans to expand the league in future editions, including multi-venue matches, games under floodlights, and a potential home-and-away format within five years.“This year, the NPL will be hosted at TU Cricket Ground, but as eight cricket stadiums are currently under construction, we plan to expand to cities outside the Kathmandu Valley,” Lama said. “If floodlights are installed at TU Ground, the future matches will be even more spectacular.”CAN has also developed a comprehensive business strategy to ensure the league’s sustainability, with goals to attract government investment and international grants.“This will take Nepali cricket into a commercial era, paving the way for further development of the game,” Lama added. CAN is making another effort to establish its own franchise league in the country following a debacle of its previous venture. It had organised Nepal T20 League in the 2022/23 season but the tournament proved a disaster as it was overshadowed by spot-fixing allegations, resulting in the involvement of Central Investigation Bureau and several arrests.CAN also faced criticisms for its mismanagement, negligence and incompetence. Eventually, the contract with Seven3Sports, to which the tournament rights were sold for eight years without a competitive bidding process, had to be terminated.This time, CAN, in its renewed effort to establish a successful franchise cricket league, seems committed to implementing stringent measures to safeguard the integrity of the NPL.Retired AIG Ishwor Babu Karki, who is the Head of Integrity at CAN and oversees anti-corruption, safeguarding, security and anti-doping for the cricket governing body, will lead the oversight unit during the NPL.“We have taken previous mistakes as a lesson. The NPL will be fair,” said Lama.“Karki will oversee the integrity of the NPL. CAN has also coordinated with all the concerned departments to make sure things comply with the ICC protocol,” he added.“CAN wants to assure that the league will be without any controversy.”The NPL—which is building on the foundation laid by earlier tournaments like Everest Premier League, Dhangadhi Premier League and Pokhara Premier League—is also positioning itself as a game-changer for domestic cricket, with the promise of becoming a vital financial lifeline for domestic players.A major highlight is the league’s title sponsorship deal with Siddhartha Bank Limited, which is being hailed as the largest sponsorship agreement in Nepali sports history. However, the exact figures of the agreement have not been disclosed.Eight franchise teams—Biratnagar Kings, Chitwan Rhinos, Janakpur Bolts, Karnali Yaks, Kathmandu Gurkhas, Lumbini Lions, Pokhara Avengers and Sudurpaschim Royals—collectively spent more than Rs50 million rupees in the auction. They secured marquee players for 2 million each, while the players graded into A B and C categories were auctioned at base prices ranging from Rs20,000 to Rs1.5 million.The big investment underscores the league’s ambition to redefine the profile of cricket in Nepal and provide robust financial support to domestic players.While CAN provides monthly incentives to national players, NPL offers a new pathway for many domestic cricketers to build sustainable careers within the country. The tournament will nurture the next generation of cricketing talent by offering them a platform to showcase their skills and catch the attention of national selectors. Each franchise has identified a local iconic player through talent hunts, further strengthening the grassroots impact of the league.“The NPL will be a big support to domestic cricketers,” Lama said. “The players are very motivated by the initiative. It also lays the ground for grassroots cricket development as the teams have conducted talent hunts in the provinces they represent. And the exciting participation of hundreds of teenagers in the hunts is further evidence of the game’s popularity.”In addition to spotlighting emerging players, the NPL offers national cricketers a global stage to showcase their abilities.“The NPL provides an opportunity for national and domestic players to share the field with foreign professionals and world’s best cricketers. This will help them learn, grow, and improve as cricketers,\" said former national player Sharad Vesawkar, who will represent Chitwan Rhinos in the NPL.Vesawkar also emphasised how the league will help highlight Nepali talent to the world while providing a financial boost to local players aspiring to build careers in cricket. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba has reached Chengdu, China, on Thursday to lay the groundwork for the visit of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.This marks Deuba’s first visit to China since her appointment as foreign minister. The visit is expected to set the tone for the prime minister’s upcoming trip, which is being keenly watched by different sectors and stakeholders, both domestic and international.During her visit, Minister Deuba is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Chengdu in Sichuan Province, on Friday. Prime Minister Oli is visiting the northern neighbour next week at the head of an 87-member delegation, which will include 39 members from the government and 48 from the private sector. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s China visit.The prime minister’s delegation includes his spouse Radhika Shakya, Foreign Minister Deuba, two advisers to the prime minister, the prime minister’s private doctor, chief secretary, foreign and finance secretaries, security personnel, senior government officials and chief of protocol of the foreign ministry, media persons and nine lawmakers from different political parties, according to a minister. The delegation will also include the chief executive officer of the Nepal Investment Board and officials from Madan Bhandari Science and Technology University. The prime minister will fly directly to Beijing on a chartered flight of Himalaya Airlines on December 2. Foreign Minister Deuba is expected to return to Nepal on Saturday and will join the prime minister’s delegation on Monday, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Nepali Ambassador to China Krishna Prasad Oli, charge d'affaires at the Nepali Embassy in Beijing Surendra Yadav, among others, will accompany her at the meeting with Wang. During the meeting, Deuba will convey to Wang the message of the Oli-led coalition government and Nepal’s revised proposal for implementing projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Oli will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on December 3, as per the itinerary. Speaking with the Post before heading for Chengdu, Deuba said she will discuss and exchange the agenda of Oli’s upcoming China visit and will update China on Nepal’s latest position on the BRI implementation plan, which has been revised and named as ‘Framework for cooperation on jointly building the BRI between Nepal and China’. Beijing had proposed the plan in early 2020.A joint Congress-UML taskforce has heavily revised the text of the document and sent it for Chinese approval. The new text of the cooperation framework, which was reviewed and approved by Prime Minister Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, was sent to the Chinese side on Wednesday for their consideration. With this, real negotiations on BRI have begun between Nepal and China, after four years. Although the Chinese side is not happy with excessive media reporting and hype around the BRI in Nepal, the narrowing of the scope of cooperation compared to the original Chinese proposal, and the spread of misinformation and disinformation by various sections about the BRI, the Chinese have not outright rejected the revised text, according to ruling party leaders. The leaders said efforts are underway to address Chinese concerns. A joint team of Congress and UML leaders met on Thursday evening to explore ways to reassure the Chinese side. “Our central message is, Nepal is committed to the BRI, of which we became a part in 2017. We want Chinese economic and technical support in order to expedite the projects under the BRI framework, and Nepal won’t backtrack on its position on the BRI,” a Nepali Congress leader told the Post.The taskforce has heavily revised the draft of the BRI implementation plan, to the dissatisfaction of the Chinese side.Chinese Ambassador Chen Song had expressed his displeasure about “biased media coverage on the BRI and statements made by political party leaders” during a meeting with Foreign Minister Deuba on Sunday.Foreign Minister Deuba rebutted claims of divisions between the Congress and the UML on the BRI.“Our leaders are one and firm on the BRI. There is no difference between us. We have also formed a team to pursue the issue of BRI and they are also talking with them [Chinese]… We have no disagreements over it [BRI]”, said Deuba.Asked whether an agreement on the BRI would materialise during the prime minister’s visit, Deuba stated that it is part of negotiations.“In diplomacy and foreign policy, when matters of bilateral relations arise, it is natural for both sides to present their respective positions. Several rounds of talks and negotiations are held in such cases. Let’s see how things unfold,” said Deuba without giving an explicit answer on whether a new agreement on BRI would be signed during Oli’s visit. During her meeting with Wang, Deuba will discuss overall agendas of the prime minister’s visit, Nepal’s expectations, and quick realisation of commitments from past high-level engagements.The new draft of the MoU on BRI cooperation framework focuses on Nepal’s current needs.“The Chinese had in early 2020 proposed the plan’s original text, which has been substantially revised, and our commitment to the BRI is well reflected in the new text,” said a task-force member on condition of anonymity because the matter is still evolving and in stage of negotiation with the Chinese side. “There is no need to include every detail or ambiguous language in the agreement that could lead to multiple interpretations. We want to see BRI as a development cooperation vehicle that will focus on projects related to connectivity, infrastructure and energy,” the member said. Officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that if the Chinese side agrees to Nepal’s terms and conditions, a new framework for cooperation could be signed during Oli’s visit.While the new text is silent on loans from Chinese banks and financial institutions for BRI projects, it emphasises Nepal's preference for grants, at least for now. The aim during the prime minister’s visit is to reach an agreement to expedite BRI projects. Nepal had initially proposed 35 projects under the BRI in 2018, but later trimmed down the list to nine at China’s request.Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa; chief political adviser to the prime minister, Bishnu Rimal; economic adviser to the prime minister, Yuba Raj Khatiwada; and advocate Semnata Dahal revised the original document proposed by China.As the prime minister prepares to visit the northern neighbour on December 2, the BRI has come into sharp focus. Various quarters are keenly watching how Nepal will negotiate the BRI deal with China. The two ruling coalition partners—the Congress and the UML—have been holding continuous negotiations to forge a common position and finalise Nepal’s stance on the support it seeks from China. If we can convince the Chinese side that Nepal is committed to the BRI and ready to execute some projects under its framework, it would serve as a positive outcome for Beijing, Kathmandu, Prime Minister Oli, the Nepali Congress and the UML, said the party leaders who are part of the negotiations.They added that a big country like China would respect and understand Nepal’s sensitivities and geopolitical location. \nAlthough abortion was legalised in Nepal in 2002, unsafe abortions are still rampant in many places throughout the country, and women are denied services, a new report shows.According to the report prepared by Center for Research on Environment Health and Population Activities (CREHPA), and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), one in 10 women seeking abortions at health facilities was denied care. Moreover, four in 10 women (42 percent) with more than 10 weeks of pregnancy or who were unaware of their gestational age were denied an abortion. “The most common reason for denial was advanced gestation age, with over 80 percent of denials attributed to this factor,” reads the report. “Denial doesn’t stop abortion; it drives women to seek alternatives. Sixty percent of women who were denied services by authorised health facilities attempted to end their pregnancies elsewhere.”Nepal legalised abortion in 2002, marking a milestone for women’s reproductive rights, their empowerment, and bodily autonomy. With legalisation, persecution and jail terms for women who terminated unwanted pregnancies ended, and unsafe abortions decreased significantly.However, the new report shows a vast gap in services, which forced women to opt for alternatives, including unsafe means.“Thirty-eight percent of women who were denied services turned to unsafe/unapproved sites for subsequent abortions,” the report stated. “Seventy-three percent of women who were denied abortion services were, in fact, legally eligible for abortion.”Access to abortion services varied based on women’s characteristics. Those under the age of 25 years, unmarried, childless, not working outside the home, of lower wealth, or seeking abortion solely for sex selection were more likely to be denied abortion. Additionally, women who were unaware of the legal status of abortion services also experienced higher rates of denial.The study was carried out on 1,841 women seeking abortion services from 22 government-approved health facilities in all seven provinces, including major cities—Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Chitwan, Butwal, Nepalgunj Kailali, Kanchanpur, Biratnagar, Jhapa among others.‘This study shows that progressive abortion laws alone are not enough to guarantee access to safe abortion for all women,” said Dr Mahesh Puri, principal investigator of the study. “Young women, those with lower educational backgrounds, and women from marginalised groups (such as the Dalit) are disproportionately affected by denials, perpetuating cycles of poverty and poor health.”Women who were denied abortion care reported substantial economic hardship, with increased rates of inadequate household income and lower labour force participation over the period of three years, according to the report.Women who are unable to receive abortion services were also less likely to achieve their personal goals. While 42 percent of women who received an abortion achieved education goals, only 31 percent of denied women did so. Similar disparities were seen in employment (54 percent vs 45 percent), child-related goals (65 percent vs 31 percent), and financial goals (66 percent vs 50 percent).Denying abortion care doesn’t only affect women; it has lasting consequences for the health of their children, according to the report. The report highlights the urgent need for targeted policies to bridge the gap between Nepal’s legal framework and the reality of service accessibility.“Ensuring that abortion services are universally accessible and affordable can help reduce economic and health disparities among Nepalese women and contribute to better outcomes for children,” reads the report.Experts say unsafe abortion is among the leading factors of maternal deaths. The study does not say anything about maternal deaths from unsafe abortions. Still, the latest census report by the National Statistics Office shows that of the total maternal deaths, six percent (37 women) had undergone abortions or suffered a miscarriage.. It is estimated that over 300,000 abortions are performed in Nepal in a year. However, the government data show only around 100,000 abortions are performed in a year at authorised health facilities. Experts say many abortion take place in unauthorised places too, which does not come into the government’s record. \nFarmer Bhirikhan Mandal in north Jhitakaiya, Bara, brought diammonium phosphate at Rs70 per kg to apply on his wheat farm. The subsidised rate is Rs45 per kg and is available only through government-designated cooperatives.“We don’t get fertiliser from the cooperative when we need it the most,” said Mandal. “We are forced to buy smuggled fertiliser openly available in the market paying higher rates.”He said that applying DAP is a must after sowing the wheat.Fertiliser shortage for winter crops could spell more trouble for most farmers, who have seen a reduced output of summer crop, mostly paddy, as a result of heavy rainfall in late September.Jagarnath Mandal, another farmer, also purchased the fertiliser at the same price as Bhirkhan. He said the fertiliser that the government provides to cooperatives in quotas is being sold in the market openly. Prithvi Sah, a senior farmer of Kalikamai rural municipality, Parsa, said the Divya Saving and Credit Cooperative received 60 bags of state-subsidised DAP through a quota system. Still, most of the farmers could not get it.“Unable to access fertiliser, most farmers are unable to sow wheat this winter. We are compelled to go to India to buy DAP,” said Sah.Saharom Raut, a farmer leader from Jagarnathpur, Parsa, said fertiliser scarcity was caused by the Agriculture Inputs Company and the Salt Trading Corporation, the agencies responsible for importing and distributing vital farm inputs, as they supplied only small quantities to the cooperatives that distribute them.“Cooperatives have been distributing fertilisers to their near and dear ones. In India, we get DAP bags weighing 45 kg at IRs3,000 whereas the actual weight would be 50 kg per bag,” said Raut.Asarfi Sah, former Parsa president of the Nepal Farmers Association, said there is a massive scarcity of DAP in the district. “Wheat sowing is being delayed due to fertiliser scarcity. Not all farmers can go across the border to India to buy fertiliser.”Known as the country’s food basket, farmers in the Tarai/Madhesh who were supposed to finish planting winter crops within mid-December could not do so due to fertiliser scarcity.Farmers are facing fertiliser scarcity for sowing wheat, pulses, lentils, and mustard, among other winter crops. Agriculture Inputs Company and Salt Trading Corporation have started distributing fertiliser from ‘buffer stock’ as their DAP stock has already run out.Purushottam Singh, information chief at the provincial office of Agriculture Inputs Company, Birgunj, said they have started distributing DAP from the buffer stock for a week. “We have already distributed 1,000 tonnes of DAP out of 3,500 tonnes in stock. We’ve heard that it will take 15 more days for the DAP to arrive from Kolkata.”Aditya Birla Company won the global tender to supply fertiliser in Nepal. The supplier will bring 25,000 tonnes of DAP to Nepal from a third country via the Kolkata dry port, said Singh.“It will take a week and a half more to arrive in Nepal after packaging in the Kolkata dry port,” said Singh. Out of the 25,000 tonnes, 26 percent will arrive at the Birgunj office. Amoj Lamichhane, chief of the Salt Trading Corporation's Birgunj provincial office, said the corporation is preparing to distribute the 320 tonnes of DAP in buffer stock to the cooperatives. “We have DAP in limited stock. Since it’s buffer stock, we are waiting for the agriculture ministry’s consent to distribute it.”Lamichhane said that 25,000 tonnes of DAP imported by the corporation will take a month to arrive. Aditya Birla is the consignment supplier.The shortage has hit farmers in western Nepal too. Shailendra Pandey of Amawa, Marchawar rural municipality-2, has been unable to sow wheat on his 4-bigha field due to the lack of urea and DAP. “I have been asking for fertiliser since harvesting paddy but have been unable to get it. They bring small amounts of subsidised fertiliser, which is taken quickly.”“I have been waiting for fertiliser to sow wheat on my 12 kattha for weeks. I have been trying to bring them from a nearby Indian market but do not have courage as border police beat farmers,” said Santu Dhawal of Gidhaiya, Gaidhawa rural municipality-5.Dhawal said that in the Indian market, a bucket of 20 kg fertiliser costs Rs800, and his neighbour has already brought and spread it. In Kapilvastu, Ram Shankar Tharu has sown wheat on a bigha without DAP fertiliser. “I used to sow wheat on three bighas, but after not getting fertiliser on time, I had to reduce it.” The recent paddy harvest was also not good. The winter output could drop if fertiliser is still unavailable, Tharu shared his worry.For wheat only, the Agriculture Inputs Company, Taulihawa, needs 2,000 tonnes of urea and 1,000 tonnes of DAP. The company received 447 tonnes of urea and 373 tonnes of DAP, and the cooperative took its share for distribution. The company’s stock has run out.“A farmer runs his home by selling agricultural yield, but we need to rely on rainwater, and we do not get seeds and fertiliser on time,” said Janardan Baral, a leading farmer.Wheat needs fertiliser input three times. While sowing, the DAP is needed. After three weeks and two months of sowing, urea needs to be applied to the crop.In Nepalgunj, Ramesh Teli went to buy a chemical fertiliser but had to return empty-handed. His nine-member family depends on farming income. “I would have already sown wheat if fertiliser was available,” he said, who grows mustard and wheat on 12 katthas.The Agriculture Inputs Company, Nepalgunj, has a small stock of DAP. It is unable to provide the quantity sought by farmers.Agriculture Inputs Company, Nepalgunj, demanded 6,000 tonnes of urea, 2,500 tonnes of DAP, and 300 tonnes of potash but received only 4,020 tonnes of urea, 685 tonnes of DAP, and 75 tonnes of potash, said Puspharaj Shrestha, the company's branch manager.According to the provincial office of Agriculture Inputs Company, Bhairahawa, it has 11,644 tonnes of urea, 2,557 tonnes of DAP, and 55 tonnes of potash. The company supplies fertiliser to Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, and two districts of Gandaki.In Sudurpashim Province, though there is no fertiliser shortage, the cooperatives have not been able to meet the demand.Kanchanpur received 4,000 tonnes of DAP and 5,500 tonnes of urea, which did not fulfil the district's demand. Wheat farming is done on 35,000 hectares in Sudurpashim.(With inputs from Shankar Acharya in Parsa, Sanju Paudel in Lumbini, Manoj Paudel in Kapilvastu, Rupa Gahatraj in Nepalgunj and Bhawani Bhatta in Kanchanpur) \nNepal suffered a 55-run defeat against Sri Lanka in their opening match of the U-19 Asia Cup at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium in the United Arab Emirates on Friday.Needing 234 for victory, Nepal U-19 team faltered against Sri Lanka’s disciplined bowling attack and were all out for 178 in 46.2 overs despite a half century from Mayen Yadav.Nepal made a fine start to their chase, with openers Aakash Tripathi and Mayen adding 39 runs for the opening stand.However, Tripathi’s dismissal for 19 in the 11th over started a collapse, with Arjun Kumal (12), Santosh Yadav (10) also departing soon.Mayan Yadav played a 62-ball knock facing 91 deliveries to take Nepal past 100 total after 29.2 overs but his removal by Praveen Maneesha (trapped lbw) left Nepal helpless.Mayen hit three fours and two sixes.Roshan Bishwakarma (5), Naren Bhatta (12) also departed soon.Uttam Magar (17) and Naren Saud (16) tried to keep up with the chase but could not guide Nepal closer to the target.Earlier, Sri Lanka posted 233 from the allotted 50 overs riding on half-centuries from Sharujan Shanmuganathan and Lakvin Abeysinghe. Despite a slow start, Shanmuganathan’s 99-ball 62 and Abeysinghe 50 off 53 took them to 167-3 in 20.3 overs and when it looked like the Lankans were heading for a big total, Santosh took both dangermen Shanmuganathan and Abeysinghe to halt the opponents’ progress.Santosh, who had also dispatched Vimath Dinsara for 24, also took the wicket of Maneesha to complete an outstanding four-wicket haul (4-30).Kavija Gamage then played 37 not out to ensure Sri Lanka finish their innings with a fightable total.Nepal play their next Group B match against Bangladesh on Sunday, followed by a clash against Afghanistan on Tuesday.Bangladesh started their Asia Cup with a commanding 45-run victory over Afghanistan in Dubai.Pakistan and India open the Group A battle with a blockbuster clash on Saturday in Dubai. Hosts United Arab Emirates are against Japan in Sharjah.  \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba met her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Chengdu, China, on Friday.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a post on X that both ministers exchanged views on various aspects of Nepal-China relations and discussed matters relating to the preparation for Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's upcoming official visit.Foreign Minister Deuba left for China on Thursday at the invitation of her Chinese counterpart to lay the ground for the prime minister’s visit. This marks her first official visit to China since her appointment as minister in July.The visit comes as the Oli-led coalition government prepares to navigate Nepal’s position on the BRI. Continuous negotiations between ruling coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—are underway to finalise Nepal’s stance on development cooperation with China. The BRI remains a key area of focus for Nepal’s engagement with its northern neighbour.According to the ministry, Prime Minister Oli will pay an official visit to China from December 2 to 5 at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang. During the visit, he will hold bilateral talks with Premier Li and exchange views on matters of mutual interest.Oli is also scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China. The prime minister will deliver a keynote speech at Peking University as part of the visit. He will also address the Nepal-China Business Forum, co-hosted by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI). \nThe Ministry of Home Affairs has warned that legal action will be taken against individuals using social media to spread hateful and misleading content.In a statement issued on Friday, the ministry said that those who undermine social harmony, disrupt public peace, or violate law and order will be brought under legal scrutiny.The ministry said it is concerned over the growing misuse of social media by some individuals to circulate divisive and false expressions, which are prohibited by law.It said that spreading content that damages inter-ethnic, religious, or communal relations, incites violence, or undermines public decency and morality will be a punishable offence. \nAmid growing concerns over severe health risks faced by Nepali migrant workers, such as heart and kidney failures due to heat stress, experts have recommended a complete overhaul of health screening protocols for those heading for foreign employment. The proposed measures aim to establish a Centralised Digital Repository System (CDRS) to ensure comprehensive and high-quality health checks for workers.A specialised task force led by Dr Dipendra Raman Singh, secretary at the Ministry of Health and Populations, submitted its findings to Minister for Labour, Employment and Social Security Sharat Singh Bhandari.The team with 30 experts comprising specialists from major hospitals including the National Academy of Medical Sciences/Bir Hospital, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Patan Academy of Health Sciences, and the Sukraraj Tropical Hospital discovered significant gaps in current health screening practices.The report stresses the need for a systematic approach to prevent malpractices in medical fitness reports, pointing out that many current health checks do not meet proper standards. Shedding light on the relevance of the report, Dr Singh highlighted the dangers posed by substandard testing, explaining that it compromises worker safety. “We observed that quality health assessments are lacking, and what is currently being done does not constitute a genuine health examination,” he said.The findings also call for a thorough revision of how the causes of deaths among workers abroad are documented, as many death certificates lack detailed explanations, often citing vague terms such as “natural” or “sudden” death. The task force underscored that better tracking and recording of health data from recruitment to employment abroad could help mitigate risks and protect workers’ health.The report reveals that inadequate or inaccessible health checks lead to premature deaths among workers abroad. The Foreign Employment Board states that around 1,000 Nepali workers die annually, with a total of 14,666 deaths recorded over the past 14 years (2008-09 to 2021-22). Key causes include cardiac arrest (19 percent), natural causes (19.5 percent), workplace accidents (7 percent), road incidents (12.7 percent), and suicide (11 percent).Professor Dr Sunil Kumar Joshi, director of the Nepal Injury Research Centre and a member of the task force, pointed out the absence of adequate occupational health training for workers, leading to preventable deaths. He emphasised the importance of informing workers about industry-specific risks and preventive measures before they leave for job destinations.The report suggests that Nepal’s health institutions need to be standardised according to international guidelines, recommending a unified process to match the health checks required by labour destination countries. This could involve strengthening diplomatic efforts to align with standards in countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Malaysia, Israel, South Korea, Australia, and European nations. It also calls for better regulation and supervision of health institutions to prevent malpractices.The inspections by a team led by an under-secretary on August 29 last year uncovered severe negligence, such as conducting health checks without real examinations, using substandard labs, and preparing reports without required equipment or staff. Following these findings, the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security suspended 67 health institutions for failing to meet standards, only allowing the renewal of those that complied.The report proposes that visa centres and health testing facilities be established in regions such as Bhairahawa and Pokhara to decentralise access and align with international practices. Minister Bhandari praised the report, stating, “Health checks should not be viewed as a mere commercial activity. They are connected to the life of the workers and need to be implemented with utmost seriousness. This report will contribute significantly to enhancing our migration policies.” \nAs the world marks the 16 days of activism against gender-based violence (GBV) with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women starting November 25, it bears recalling the different forms of violence inflicted upon women and young girls and how effective these campaigns are. According to the United Nations, one in three women globally experiences physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. The reality is dire in Nepal too. The Demographic Health Survey 2022 reveals that one in three Nepali women aged 15-49 has experienced some form of violence. Further, with the rise of technology, women have been experiencing harassment, non-consensual sexting, hate and fear in online spaces. The unresolved and harrowing rape-and-murder of Nirmala Panta is an example of the pervasive and enduring nature of GBV in Nepal.Campaigns and activism hold great promise to challenge and confront the violence women face. In Nepal, the government, non-profit organisations and international agencies join hands to discuss the issues of women and find practical solutions. Yet their actions are mostly urban-centric, with rallies and programmes not reaching the grassroots level. For countless Nepali women in rural areas who face multiple layers of marginalisation, these 16 days offer little in terms of solace or change. Words don’t translate into actions even as their issues get the centre stage. Apparently, despite having abundant legal frameworks against GBV, Nepal ranks 71 out of 190 economies in the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law Safety indicator, which focuses on four key areas: child marriage, sexual harassment, domestic violence and femicide. The UN’s report “Femicides in 2023” states that “home is the most dangerous place for women”. Nepal is no exception, as out of 21,568 cases of violence against women reported between July 2021 and July 2022, 80 percent were related to domestic violence. And intimate partner violence—a subset of domestic violence—remains the most challenging issue to tackle. Meanwhile, with the rise of artificial intelligence, deepfakes of women have become common. Our outdated cyber laws fail to cover new threats against women and leave them ever-vulnerable in online spaces; Nepal remains far behind in addressing technology-facilitated gender violence. While this slow progress is partly due to the enduring severity of domestic and intimate partner violence, which demands significant attention and resources from the government and other stakeholders, it would be dangerous to overlook online forms of violence against women. For women going through physical and mental trauma brought about by various forms of violence, no lofty words pronounced at forums offer relief. Addressing such pervasive issues needs practical actions like making them capable enough to recognise and resist domestic violence. It is also vital to goad survivors to break silence about the abuse they face, as according to the 2022 health survey, 58 percent of women who experience physical and sexual violence don’t seek support or speak up. If they did speak up, it would be much easier for police and other authorities to intervene and help. Yet more can be done. Alongside designated days to counter violence against women, as many women’s rights activists emphasise, there should also be year-round advocacy on GBV. Sensitising men about violence against women and bringing—and enacting—stringent laws to dismantle the evolving structures that perpetuate gender-based violence are the bare minimum needed to build safe spaces for women. \nIn politics, timing carries a big message.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s CPN-UML staged a road show on Durbarmarg in front of the now-museum royal palace on November 22. Dubbed Jagaran Sabha, the ruling party’s unusual political rally followed the arrest of Durga Prasai, a former nominated central committee member of the UML, on the charge of making ‘baseless’ allegations against Oli that the sitting premier had huge investments in a Cambodian telecom company. Prasai, who is being investigated for cybercrime of circulating doctored documents online, once had unhindered access to the residences of Oli and his former comrade, the ex-PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal. It did not take Prasai long to harbour enmity against the two former insurgents.Prasai’s allegations do not seem to hold much water, but there are calls in the political circles already to investigate if Oli, like many top Nepali leaders fairly or unfairly facing the charges of hiding their kickbacks abroad, has wealth stashed in a safe haven.Oli’s feeble show of mass—against domestic rivals, conspirators and foreign foes alike—might be interpreted as the public no longer having an interest in chest-thumping politicians: All that matters is how much they can deliver in real terms. It was visible in the pictures that the UML workers and supporters who marched up to the rally had enormous space left to fill on the former King’s Way.Many view Rabi Lamichhane’s earlier arrest and ongoing investigation in detention for over a month now, in a case of cooperatives savings embezzlement, as a fight between old forces and his newly formed outfit that once held the potential to corner traditional parties in the next round of elections. Doing his bit to unsettle the old guard is the independent Kathmandu mayor, Balen Shah, who one day threatens to burn down Singha Durbar and, on another, slaps a hefty fine on the prime minister’s party for failing to clean up after the rally before the day is barely over.However, one thing has become amply clear: Old tricks have ceased to amuse Nepalis. They have bigger problems to tackle: Lack of jobs, ineffective healthcare, unproductive education and national humiliation caused by centuries of underdevelopment and their leaders’ shameless pomp.Nepal’s global stature appears to be diminishing despite the country’s geostrategic location. Nepali passport bearers face harassment around the world in various ways. Even in the neighbourhood, the importance accorded to the Nepali government heads is shaky. Possibly due to New Delhi’s apparent refusal to receive the new Nepal prime minister even after a top New York meeting, Oli is bound for Beijing on Monday. This, by no means, should be a China card he’s playing, as Dahal alleged recently. Nepal has its own interests to pursue, especially in the periphery. The country with a huge potential in hydropower wouldn’t have been able to sell clean energy to Bangladesh without India providing the transmission line. In the same vein, Kathmandu and Beijing have signed a mega connectivity framework to extend road, rail and communication networks. Oli’s China visit, in a break from the oft-followed tradition of Nepali prime ministers going to India first, has the signing of an agreement on President Xi Jinping’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) high on the agenda.The matter of concern for Nepalis is not where our prime minister goes first but what achievement we’ll have from our government’s engagements with our neighbours. And our neighbours should only be concerned if Kathmandu’s relations with any foreign capital harm their own national interests. Locked between two Asian giants, Nepal has no history of harming its neighbours’ broad interests, while it may have suffered immensely from their unilateral policies.Both China and India are undeniable global powers, their economic and military might forever rising. While a smaller Nepal cannot afford to antagonise one of them, it reserves all the right to grow peacefully. Nepal can partner with its neighbours only in ventures it can afford and sustain. Even if our leaders, including Oli, tried to sway Nepalis with their balloony dreams in the past, the people living without ample means have come to grips with their bitter realities.Yes, Nepalis today are deserting their country, but the vast majority of them want to build their lives and careers here in their own towns and villages. Whether more Nepalis will be frustrated to live in their country will depend on how effectively our political leadership works for the national good.Since 2015, three old politicians have been playing the musical chair of power. Once on the hot seat, they are largely consumed by their urge to defeat opponents and thus have little appetite to serve the public or national interests. They’ve primarily relied on empty rhetoric to pacify a disenchanted public, but the old tool has lost its edge. Oli’s Durbarmarg speech might have been intended to browbeat accusers and opponents and calm the segment of society getting tired of delayed delivery, but it utterly failed in its purpose. The same will be the fate of political workers who make promises but fail to keep them. On the demo day, Oli said there was no rule on which country a Nepali prime minister should visit first and that he was going to China not for a pleasure trip.A country's foreign policy is often shaped by national politics. Sometimes, outreaches are made to assure the domestic public; sometimes, the signalling goes beyond. However, a botched foreign venture not only diverts domestic attention but can also create trouble.People here will be watching what deal Oli cuts in Beijing or what concessions he’ll make to the Chinese president’s global connectivity project. The ruling Congress-UML coalition is split over how BRI projects should be funded. The official position of the Congress party is that Nepal should only accept grants to undertake such projects. Differences between Nepal and China have delayed BRI implementation even as Kathmandu signed it up in 2017. Postures from both sides will have much bearing on the Nepali sentiment that prosperity will trickle into the country from the north in case it takes a while to navigate the Ganga upstream.Not least for his light demeanour, Oli is taken seriously only for his stance in the face of India’s blockade in 2015 and his opening up avenues across the Himalaya. His visit to the north this time draws a tangent to the south. BRI or no BRI, Nepali politicians must be able to reassure the domestic population that their aspirations will be fulfilled more by internal effort than through external dealings. Without delivery, platforms like the jagaran (awakening) rally will only let the people down. \nImagine, for a moment, walking through the streets of Dhaka on a cold winter morning. The smog hangs thick in the air, wrapping the city in a grey blanket. The sun, struggling to break through, casts a dull light over the buildings. This isn't just an unpleasant sight, it's a sign of a public health emergency. The \"State of Global Air 2024\" report confirms what many of us already know—Dhaka has one of the worst air quality in the world, consistently ranking among the top cities with hazardous pollution levels. On one particular morning, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Dhaka was measured at 291—labelled \"very unhealthy.\" This means that every breath we take in Dhaka carries harmful particles that can damage our lungs, hearts, and even brains.The problem is not just the occasional bad day—it is a constant, pervasive issue. Every year, more than 230,000 people in Bangladesh die from diseases linked to air pollution, and many of these deaths are avoidable. Perhaps the most heartbreaking fact is that children are bearing the brunt of this pollution. According to the latest report, air pollution is the second-leading cause of death among children under five, after malnutrition. In 2021, over 19,000 children in Bangladesh died from air pollution-related diseases, such as pneumonia and asthma. These are not just statistics—they represent children who never had the chance to grow up.In many ways, this situation mirrors the bleak descriptions of industrialised cities found in classic English literature. Take, for example, Charles Dickens' portrayal of Victorian London in Bleak House, where the fog was not just a physical phenomenon but a symbol of the social and moral decay of the time. The thick, suffocating fog in Dickens' novel could be seen as a metaphor for the way pollution clouds our judgment today—distorting our understanding of the consequences of our actions and making it difficult to see the full picture of the damage we are causing to the environment and to each other. Just as the poor of Dickens' London suffered most in the industrial age, today it is the poorest communities in Dhaka, along with our children, who are most affected by the toxic air.As we look around, it's hard to ignore the fact that the streets of Dhaka, like those of Dickensian London, are filled with people who have little choice but to breathe in the polluted air. But unlike the poor workers of the past, we have the knowledge and resources to act. We know the dangers. The question is: will we take responsibility for the future of our city and its people?Air pollution, particularly the fine particles known as PM2.5, is the silent killer here. These particles are so small that they can enter our lungs and bloodstream, causing long-term damage. Children are especially vulnerable because their lungs are still developing, and they breathe in more air relative to their body weight than adults do. This means that every breath a child takes in Dhaka could be harmful. In fact, the pollutants in the air can cause lifelong health issues, including asthma, lung diseases, and even brain development problems. As a result, children grow up in a city that doesn't just limit their dreams—it limits their health.Dhaka's air pollution is not just a human problem, it is a problem that affects the environment as well. Just as a novel's setting shapes the characters, the environment shapes the lives of those who live in it. In Dhaka, the air is no longer something we can take for granted. It is a poisoned gift, one that we have collectively polluted through our choices—choices about how we build, how we commute, and how we use energy.The dense fog in the streets, the visible haze over the skyline, are not just symptoms of a poorly managed city, they are the result of years of environmental neglect. We have allowed the city to grow without the necessary green spaces, proper waste management, and a public transportation system that reduces the need for countless private cars. The irony is that, despite all the noise, the real crisis is silent. The children suffer in ways that are unseen, and we have become numb to the changes happening around us.But we do not have to resign ourselves to this fate. There is hope if we choose to act. We can invest in cleaner technologies, such as electric vehicles and green public transport systems. We can clean up our industries and encourage businesses to adopt sustainable practices. We can also work to improve household air quality by providing alternatives to polluting fuels. The government and citizens must work together to find solutions.The health of our children, the future of Dhaka, and the future of our planet depend on the choices we make today. It is time to change the narrative, take control of our story, and ensure that the air we breathe is not the tragic backdrop to our lives but a source of life, health, and hope for future generations. The thick, suffocating fog we face is not inevitable—it is a challenge we must overcome for the sake of our children and the world they will inherit.—The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nMany may find a pair of recent decisions on constitution implementation and amendment in Nepal baffling. It was nearly five months ago that the country’s two largest political parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—joined hands to form a coalition government, an unusual practice in a parliamentary system. They argued that the need for the constitution amendment made them forge an alliance as such a move would need a two-thirds parliamentary majority and a broad political understanding.Months after the two forces crafted a coalition government with the promise to amend the constitution, a parliamentary committee formed a sub-panel to conduct a detailed study of the laws needed for full-fledged implementation of the constitution promulgated in September 2015. The Legislation Management Committee of the National Assembly has set up a five-member subcommittee to study how many laws still need to be enacted. An earlier study conducted by a similar panel under the leadership of lawmaker Anita Devkota had found that 40 laws need amendments or replacement to align with the constitution. The earlier committee’s report, which was endorsed by the full committee in June last year, made several recommendations to the legislature and the government to update the laws in line with the constitution. But instead of doing so, the government and the parliament have either not drafted the bills or sat on several ones in the House. Now, the upper house has formed one more sub-committee.The Congress-UML coalition floated the proposal of constitution amendment while without first doing even the basics to implement the constitution. They haven’t formulated laws to allow the provincial and local authorities to use the rights enshrined in the constitution. Chief ministers of the seven provinces have been continuously pressing top leaders in Kathmandu to make necessary laws. They argue that the provinces have failed in delivery mainly in the absence of their own police and civil servants. There are several other sectors where sub-national governments have failed to perform in the absence of necessary laws as required by the constitution. This shows the hollowness of the political parties’ advocacy for constitution amendment. Really, how can a constitution’s performance be judged and amended without first fully implementing it? And, will the major political forces that didn’t even formulate laws needed for the full-fledged implementation of the statute in the past nine years suddenly start working to improve the national charter? So the problem lies in the honesty of the leaders. It’s no secret that top leaders of major parties—mainly the Congress and the UML—were not in favour of the federal system. They agreed to embrace it in the face of a wave of movement in favour of state restructuring that picked up during the eight-year-long constitution writing period. While the Congress and the UML leaders accepted federalism reluctantly, CPN (Maoist Centre) chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal has often used federalism-related issues as a political tool. It was evident in the course of naming Koshi Province. While finalising the name, he first instructed Maoist lawmakers to vote in favour of naming the province ‘Koshi’ and later he provoked ethnic communities to keep fighting for an identity-based nomenclature. In sum, at the core of the problem lies the leaders’ reluctance to devolve the centralised powers to the sub-national authorities. Such confusion and contradiction will keep cropping up until the leaders are committed to formulating necessary laws and clearing the way to allow provincial and local authorities to exercise their constitutional rights. \n: A fire in a house in ward 9 of Marsyangdi Rural Municipality in Lamjung district, claimed the life of a 45-year-old man on Thursday night.The deceased, identified as Dharti Tamang, was originally from Chitwan. Tamang was living in the stone-and-mud house owned by Lukumari Gurung for the past two years, said Deputy Superintendent of Police Nishant Srivastava. His body has been sent to the District Hospital in Besisahar for postmortem. According to police, the fire broke out at around 11pm and was controlled by 2am. Local resident Tej Bahadur Gurung said Tamang’s charred body was recovered after the fire was extinguished. Authorities and locals suspect the fire started from Tamang’s room, possibly from a cigarette butt that ignited a nearby straw heap. Police are conducting further investigations into the incident. \nIsraeli military strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians overnight in the Gaza Strip, most of them in the Nuseirat camp at the centre of the enclave, medics said on Friday, after some tanks pulled back from an area they had raided.Medics said they had recovered 19 bodies of Palestinians killed in northern areas of Nuseirat, one of the enclave’s eight long-standing refugee camps.The rest were killed in the northern and southern areas of the Gaza Strip, medics added. There was no fresh statement by the Israeli military on Friday, but on Thursday it said its forces were continuing to “strike terror targets as part of the operational activity in the Gaza Strip”.Some Israeli tanks remained active in the western area of the camp and the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said teams were unable to respond to distress calls from residents trapped inside their houses.Medics said an Israeli drone later on Friday killed Ahmed Al-Kahlout, head of the Intensive Care Unit at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip, where the army has been operating since early October.Al-Kahlout was killed by a missile fired from the drone as he walked through the hospital gate, two medical officials at Kamal Adwan Hospital told Reuters. Earlier in the week, the director of the hospital and 12 other medics were wounded in similar attacks, the Gaza health ministry said.There was no immediate Israeli army comment.Kamal Adwan Hospital is one of three medical facilities on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip that are now barely operational due to shortages of medical, fuel, and food supplies. Health officials said most of its medical staff had been either detained or expelled by the Israeli army.DisplacementsThe Israeli army said forces operating in Beit Lahiya, Jabalia and Beit Hanoun since Oct. 5 aimed to prevent Hamas militants from regrouping and waging attacks from those areas. Residents said the army was depopulating the towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun as well as the Jabalia refugee camp.The head of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said on Thursday Israel’s seven-week offensive in the northern edge of Gaza had uprooted some 130,000 people.Meanwhile, Israeli authorities released around 30 Palestinians whom it had detained in the past few months during its Gaza offensive. Those released arrived at a hospital in southern Gaza for medical checkups, medics said.Freed Palestinians, detained during the war, have complained of ill-treatment and torture in Israeli detention after they were released. Israel denies torture.Months of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza have yielded scant progress, and negotiations are now on holdA ceasefire in the parallel conflict between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, took effect before dawn on Wednesday, bringing a halt to hostilities that had escalated sharply in recent months and had overshadowed the Gaza conflict.Announcing the Lebanon accord on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said he would now renew his push for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, urging Israel and Hamas to seize the moment.Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 44,300 people and displaced nearly all the enclave’s population at least once, Gaza officials say. Vast swathes of the territory are in ruins.The Hamas-led militants who attacked southern Israeli communities 13 months ago, triggering the war, killed some 1,200 people and captured more than 250 hostages, Israel has said. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nAustralians reacted on Friday with a mixture of anger and relief to a social media ban on children under 16 that the government says is world-leading, but which tech giants like TikTok argue could push young people to “darker corners of the internet”.Australia approved the social media ban for children late on Thursday after an emotive debate that has gripped the nation, setting a benchmark for jurisdictions around the world with one of the toughest regulations targeting Big Tech.The law forces tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) to TikTok to stop minors from logging in or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million). A trial of enforcement methods will start in January, with the ban to take effect in a year.“Platforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday.“We’re making sure that mums and dads can have that different conversation today and in future days.”Announcing the details of the ban earlier this month, Albanese cited the risks to physical and mental health of children from excessive social media use, in particular the risks to girls from harmful depictions of body image, and misogynist content aimed at boys.In Sydney on Friday, reaction to the ban was mixed.“I think that’s a great idea, because I found that the social media for kids (is) not really appropriate, sometimes they can look at something they shouldn’t,” said Sydney resident Francesca Sambas.Others were more scathing.“I’m feeling very angry, I feel that this government has taken democracy and thrown it out the window,” said 58-year-old Shon Klose.“How could they possibly make up these rules and these laws and push it upon the people?”Children, meanwhile, said they would try to find a way around the ban.“I feel like I still will use it, just secretly get in,” said 11-year-old Emma Wakefield.WORLD FIRSTCountries including France and some US states have passed laws to restrict access for minors without a parent’s permission, but the Australian ban is absolute. A full under-14s ban in Florida is being challenged in court on free speech grounds.Albanese’s Labor party won crucial support from the opposition conservatives for the bill that was fast-tracked through the country’s parliament as part of 31 bills pushed through in a chaotic final day of parliament for the year.The government has said enough notice was given as it first flagged the ban after a parliamentary inquiry earlier this year that heard testimony from parents of children who had self-harmed due to cyber bullying.But it was criticised by social media firms and some lawmakers who say the bill has lacked proper scrutiny.A spokesperson for TikTok, which is hugely popular with teen users, said on Friday the process had been rushed and risked putting children into greater danger.“We’re disappointed the Australian government has ignored the advice of the many mental health, online safety, and youth advocacy experts who have strongly opposed the ban,” the spokesperson said.Albanese said on Friday passing the bill before the age verification trial has been completed was the correct approach.“We’ve got your back is our message to Australian parents,” Albanese said.“We don’t argue that its implementation will be perfect, just like the alcohol ban for under 18s doesn’t mean that someone under 18 never has access, but we know that it’s the right thing to do.”The ban could strain Australia’s relationship with key ally the United States, where X owner Elon Musk, a central figure in the administration of president-elect Donald Trump, said in a post this month it seemed a “backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians”.It also builds on an existing mood of antagonism between Australia and mostly US-domiciled tech giants. Australia was the first country to make social media platforms pay media outlets royalties for sharing their content and now plans to threaten them with fines for failing to stamp out scams. \nNepal’s leading internet service provider, WorldLink Communications has received an investment of €10 million from Finnfund, Finland’s development financier.The agreement was signed by WorldLink’s Chairman, Dileep Agrawal, and Finnfund’s Senior Investment Manager and Head of Digital Infrastructure and Solutions Portfolio, Kutti Kilpeläinen, in the presence of Finland’s Minister for Foreign Trade and Development, Ville Tavio.“WorldLink has been working towards bridging the digital divide in Nepal by expanding its services to rural and remote areas,” said Kutti Kilpeläinen. “As a Finnish investor, we also value the fact that WorldLink is using Nokia’s advanced technology to expand its services.”“Finnfund is ready to assist WorldLink in managing environmental and social risks during the data centre construction,” Kilpeläinen added.WorldLink Chairman Agrawal described the investment as an important step in expanding internet access nationwide. “This funding will help us accelerate digital transformation, bridging the gap between urban and rural areas.”The collaboration between Nokia, a Finnish technology and equipment manufacturer, and WorldLink aims to offer customers a more reliable, faster, and secure internet experience.Worldlink with over 5,000 employees has been able to attract significant foreign investment from British International Investment (BII) and Dolma Impact Fund (DIF), the internet service provider said. Finnfund, a development and impact investor, focuses on sustainable businesses primarily in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It only invests in countries defined as developing by the OECD/DAC, read a press release issued after the signing ceremony.  \nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday made the official announcement of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s upcoming visit to China.According to the ministry, Oli will pay an official visit to China from December 2 to 5 at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang. During the visit, he will hold bilateral talks with Premier Li and exchange views on matters of mutual interest.Oli is also scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China.As part of the visit, the prime minister will deliver a keynote address at Peking University. He will also address the Nepal-China Business Forum, co-hosted by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI).The prime minister’s entourage will include Arzu Rana Deuba, minister for Foreign Affairs; Bishnu Prasad Rimal, chief adviser to the prime minister; Yuba Raj Khatiwada, economic and development advisor; members of parliament; high-ranking government officials; representatives of the private sector; and media persons.In preparation for Oli’s visit, Foreign Minister Rana Deuba left for China on Thursday at the invitation of her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. This marks her first official visit to China since her appointment as minister in July.During her visit, Rana will hold bilateral talks with Wang in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, and convey Nepal’s proposals for implementing projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). She is expected to return to Nepal on Saturday.The visit comes as the Oli-led coalition government prepares to navigate Nepal’s position on the BRI. Continuous negotiations between ruling coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—are underway to finalise Nepal’s stance on development cooperation with China. The BRI remains a key area of focus for Nepal’s engagement with its northern neighbour. \nOil prices rose slightly on Friday following a potential renewal of supply risk as Israel and Hezbollah traded accusations of ceasefire violations, and as a delay to an OPEC+ meeting left investors awaiting a decision on its output policy.Brent crude futures rose 10 cents, or 0.1%, to $73.38 a barrel by 0516 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $69.17, up 45 cents, or 0.7%, compared to Wednesday’s closing price.On a weekly basis, Brent futures were down 2.4% and the US WTI benchmark was trading 2.9% lower. Trading remained thin due to the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday that shut US financial markets.Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah traded accusations on Thursday over alleged violations of their ceasefire that came into effect the day before. The deal had at first appeared to alleviate the potential for supply disruption from a broader conflict that had led to a risk premium for oil.Oil supplies from the Middle East, though, have been largely unaffected during Israel’s parallel conflicts with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, delayed its next policy meeting to December 5 from December 1 to avoid a scheduling conflict. OPEC+ is expected to further extend its production cuts at the meeting.BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, downgraded its Brent price forecast on Friday to $76/bbl in 2025 from $78/bbl previously, citing a “bearish fundamental outlook, ongoing weakness in oil market sentiment and the downside pressure on prices we expect to accrue under Trump.”“Although we expect the OPEC+ group will opt to roll over the existing cuts into the new year, this will not be sufficient to fully erase the production glut we forecast for next year,” BMI analysts said in a note.Also on Thursday, Russia struck Ukrainian energy facilities for the second time this month. ANZ analysts said the attack risked retaliation that could affect Russian oil supply.Iran told a UN nuclear watchdog it would install more than 6,000 additional uranium-enriching centrifuges at its enrichment plants, a confidential report by the watchdog said on Thursday.Analysts at Goldman Sachs have said Iranian supply could drop by as much as 1 million barrels per day in the first half of next year if Western powers tighten sanctions enforcement on its crude oil output. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nBikram Timilsina is the chair and research fellow of the Asian Institute for Advanced Research (AIFAR), Kathmandu. He is an interdisciplinary researcher with expertise in politics, geopolitics, climate change, peace processes, and social inclusion. He holds a PhD in politics and international relations from Griffith University, Australia and two master’s degrees in International Studies and English. Timilsina’s passion for reading literary books began in childhood. During his school years in Nuwakot, he was driven to read more. Despite its proximity to Kathmandu, Nuwakot lacked library access, leaving him without the opportunity to explore his interest in books. Reflecting on his early years, Timilsina shares, “We formed a group of friends under the Pratibha Bidyarthi Manch, a youth student club we established. Through initiatives like organising the Deusi Bhailo programme, we raised funds to set up a library in our village.”He ran a literary show on Radio Sagarmatha from 2004 to 2014. This passion paved the way for his Gajal collection, ‘Ali Ali Chot Deu’, published in 2006. Moreover, he has published articles on national and international platforms. In this conversation with the Post’s Sanskriti Pokharel, Timilsina discusses how he balances academic readings with literary books. Do you read for knowledge or comfort? I don’t usually choose books based on preconceived expectations. Instead, I rely on a few personal criteria when selecting what to read. At times, books and their characters inspire me; other times, I turn to them for sheer joy and enjoyment. My current interests often shape my book choices. If researching the Nepal-India relationship, I lean toward books that align with that topic. In this way, my reading becomes a source of knowledge and comfort while mirroring my intellectual interests and current priorities.How do you balance academic readings with literary books as an interdisciplinary researcher?As an interdisciplinary researcher, balancing academic readings with literary books can be challenging. I often turn to literature during breaks from academic work, finding it a refreshing escape. However, I must admit that lately, I’ve felt somewhat disconnected from literary reading.Several recently purchased literary books remain untouched, awaiting the time and attention they deserve. The demands of my professional commitments and academic research have made it challenging to dedicate time to leisurely reading. To address this, I’m considering reserving my weekends—Saturdays and Sundays—exclusively for literary exploration. This approach will help me better balance academic pursuits with the joy of reading literature.How did you go from earning a degree in English to International Relations?I completed my first Master’s degree in English in 2007. Over time, I began developing a deeper awareness of political and current affairs. As I became more informed, I reflected on Nepal's challenges, questioning why the country struggles to progress, why politics is often dismissed as a ‘dirty game’ and what changes are necessary for a positive transformation.As a citizen, my curiosity expanded beyond literature. I felt compelled to understand Nepal's political, social, and geographical issues. I was impacted by the country’s fragile position between two powerful neighbours and its struggle to find stability during the Comprehensive Peace Accord. Nepal was still wrestling with conflict then, and the dream of lasting peace felt distant.These reflections inspired a strong desire to contribute to peacebuilding, geopolitics, and international relations. This led me to pursue a PhD in politics and international relations, where I could delve into these pressing issues and work toward meaningful solutions for Nepal’s future.Does literature complement your political and social research?Absolutely. My background in literature has shaped who I am today. Studying literature goes far beyond reading fiction or poetry; it involves engaging with diverse philosophical foundations and critical theories developed by thinkers over time. For example, exploring fields like feminism, postcolonialism, cultural studies, and deconstruction offers deep insights into power dynamics, identity, and societal structures.These theoretical frameworks are essential for understanding different worldviews and grasping the core principles of politics and international relations. My master’s degree in English provided me with valuable insights into these theories, which became instrumental as I ventured into international relations and politics. It helped me navigate complex global issues and perspectives more easily while equipping me with analytical tools to interpret and better understand political and social phenomena.I feel fortunate to have studied literature, as it laid a strong foundation that enriched my approach to political and social research. It also highlighted the interconnectedness between the humanities and the social sciences, enabling me to view these fields through a broader and more nuanced lens.Do specific genres help you understand the complex issues you study? In terms of genres, I am fond of reading both fiction and non-fiction. I love to read prose, which is more poetic. I enjoy books that reflect the natural world's complexity, often inspiring readers to compare the world in literature with those outside it. As a researcher addressing issues, I sometimes connect the problems depicted in literature to those in reality. While being well-informed is essential in research, imagination is just as important. The imaginative world of literature has given me valuable ideas and insights for my work.How does reading inspire your writing?Reading influences my writing approach. Fiction opens doors to human emotions and complexities, fostering empathy and creativity. It challenges my imagination, helping me explore different narrative styles, often shaping how I express ideas and build arguments.Nonfiction, on the other hand, sharpens my analytical thinking. It presents strong arguments, factual depth, and clear reasoning, enhancing my critical skills. These genres nurture creativity and precision—essential traits for any writer. This balance enriches my understanding of issues.Every book I read, whether fiction or nonfiction, sparks a continuous dialogue in my mind, inspiring me to write with originality, depth, and purpose.Bikram Timilsina’s book recommendationsAntarmanko YatraAuthor: Jagadish GhimirePublisher: Book HillYear: 2008This rare book reminds me of life’s impermanence.

He was allegedly involved in a fraud case involving the Kalimati-based Swarnalakshmi Cooperative.According to police officials, Lamichhane was transferred to Kathmandu after recording his statement on the charges of embezzling deposits borrowed from the Suryadarshan Cooperative in Pokhara.The Kathmandu District Court issued an arrest warrant against Lamichhane on November 17 for his alleged role in misappropriating funds from the Swarnalakshmi Cooperative.An arrest warrant was also issued against former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, one of the partners of Lamichhane in Gorkha Media Network, in connection with the Swarnalakshmi case. Joshi’s statement was recorded at the District Attorney’s Office in Kathmandu.The Kaski Court on November 24 extended his remand by an additional 15 days for further investigation. Lamichhane had been in custody for over 40 days when the latest remand was granted. While investigations in Kaski focus on cooperatives fraud, organised crime, and money laundering, Lamichhane is also implicated in similar cases involving Butwal's Supreme Cooperative and was previously questioned by the Rupandehi District Attorney’s Office.Following his statement in Kathmandu, Lamichhane will be returned to Kaski. Additionally, arrest warrants have been issued against Lamichhane and others in Chitwan.Lamichhane was apprehended by a Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) team from the RSP’s central office in Banasthali, Kathmandu on October 18, and transported to Pokhara for investigation. Previous probes including the one conducted by a special parliamentary committee alleged that he, as the managing director of the the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network, was involved in diverting funds from multiple cooperatives, including Rs30 million, into personal accounts. \nThe Election Commission is all set to hold the local bypolls on December 1. Three of the 44 vacant posts have seen representatives elected unopposed. According to the commission, at least 377 people are in the fray for the remaining posts.The district coordination committee candidates in Kailali and Okhaldhunga won unopposed from the Nepali Congress. While Tek Raj Bhattarai and Tika Kumari Chaudhary of the Congress were unchallenged, CPN (Maoist Centre) candidate Jagat Gharti had no contenders for the Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality ward 2 chairperson post, according to election officials.“We are all set to conduct the by-elections,” said Nita Pokharel Aryal, spokesperson for the Election Commission.Although 25 political parties have registered to participate in the by-elections for the local governments, the Hamro Nepal Party, the Nepal Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), the Nepali Congress (BP), the Nepal Janata Dal, and the Aam Janta Party did not field any contestants. Only 20 political parties are taking part in the election.According to the Local Level Election Act 2017, if the position of the district coordination committee chief, deputy chief, rural municipality chairman, vice-chairman, municipality mayor, deputy mayor and ward chair falls vacant for any reason before the end of their term and if more than one year of their term remains, the remaining term will be filled through a by-election.Congress had won most of the seats where the by-elections are taking place. Possibly for that reason, Congress has gone to the by-elections under the command of the party’s General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma.“Congress won 30 of the seats that are now vacant,” said Shyam Kumar Ghimire, the party's chief whip. “We aim to retain them through the by-election.”The Congress failed to perform well in the last two by-elections—held in 2023 and April 2024—to elect federal and provincial lawmakers. According to Ghimire, Congress lawmakers from the respective districts where the by-elections are being held are already in their constituency to help the party’s candidates.“Apart from them, even lawmakers from other districts are in the campaign to make sure Congress candidates win the election,” Ghimire said.After the Congress, the Maoist Centre lost its seven elected representatives since the last local election. The Maoist leaders also express confidence in retaining the posts.“Respective leaders in charge of the parties’ provincial committees lead their by-election campaigns, and the federal and provincial lawmakers are also on the campaign trail,” Shreeram Dhakal, the Maoist Centre office secretary, said.Leaders of CPN-UML, which lost seven ward chairpersons, claim that they will win more seats. While the Congress has fielded its General Secretary Sharma as the election commander, the UML has not given any specific task related to the by-election to any of its central leaders.“The election department of the party is overseeing the campaign, and our party has not assigned any central leader as the commander per se,” said Niraj Acharya, the UML poll department head.Among the 30 posts up for grabs, the Congress secured two seats unopposed, while the Maoist Centre took one without contest. The UML and the Maoist Centre do not seem to have put their focus on the by-elections the same way as the Congress. However, federal and provincial lawmakers of the UML in whose district election is taking place are also on the field.Among the 41 posts, Koshi and Karnali provinces are holding by-elections for eight posts each. Madhesh and Bagmati will witness by-elections for seven posts. Sudurpaschim will have the by-election for five posts and Lumbini six. A by-election will be held in Gandaki for a post only.The by-election will be held for one municipal mayor, two village council chairmen, four vice-chairmen, one deputy mayor, and 33 ward chairmen. According to the Election Commission, elections will also be held for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in Kathmandu and the deputy mayor of Nalgad Municipality in Jajarkot.Similarly, elections will be held for the posts of chairperson of Gramthan Rural Municipality of Morang and Mahabu Rural Municipality of Dailekh, Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha, Sarkegad Rural Municipality of Humla, and vice chairperson of Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality of Bajura.Elections will be held for the ward chairperson of Sirijanga Rural Municipality-3 of Taplejung, Kankai Municipality-6 of Jhapa, Laligurans Municipality-8 of Tehrathum, Gadhi Rural Municipality-6 of Sunsari, Molung Rural Municipality-5 of Okhaldhunga, and Triyuga Municipality-12 of Udayapur.Likewise, elections will be held for ward chairpersons in Belka Municipality-9 of Udayapur, Dakneshwari Municipality wards 1 and 4 of Saptari, Dhanushadham Municipality-1 of Dhanusha, Ramgopalpur Municipality-2 of Mahottari, Ishanath Municipality-7, Rajpur Municipality-6 and Gadhimai Municipality-8 of Rautahat. The Kathmandu Metropolitan City ward 16 holds the election for the post of ward chairperson. Two wards of Kirtipur Municipality, 1 and 4, will also have the election.Kakani Rural Municipality-2 of Nuwakot, Hetauda Sub-metropolitan City-12 of Makawanpur, Gorkha Municipality-5 of Gorkha, Musikot Municipality-1 of Gulmi, Runtigadhi Rural Municipality-4 of Rolpa, Thakurbaba Municipality-4 of Bardiya, and Suddhodhan Rural Municipality-1 of Kapilvastu also will have the by-election, according to the Election Commission.Similarly, elections will also be held for ward chairpersons in Dullu Municipality-13 of Dailekh, Tilagufa Municipality-4 of Kalikot, Kushe Rural Municipality-7 of Jajarkot, Tripurasundari Municipality-5 of Dolpa, Sanibheri Rural Municipality-5 of Rukum (West), Surma Rural Municipality-4 of Bajhang, Purbichauki Rural Municipality-6 of Doti, Duhun Rural Municipality-5 of Darchula and Bhimdatta Municipality-6 of Kanchanpur. \nNepal plans to ask China to provide grants to execute projects under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s upcoming visit to China.A new memorandum of understanding (MoU) will be signed to expedite BRI projects, by clearly mentioning the projects in the MoU, as per the latest understanding between the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML which is subject to be approved by the Chinese side.As the prime minister is set to visit the northern neighbour from December 2, the BRI is now in focus, with various quarters keen to see how Nepal will navigate and negotiate the BRI deal with China. Kathmandu is currently considering the BRI implementation plan proposed by Beijing. The new MoU might be titled “Cooperation Framework on Jointly Building of the BRI between Nepal and China,” said the members of the task force, and it will be shared with the Chinese side for their approval.If approved by the Chinese side, a new MoU on BRI will be signed during Oli’s visit besides other agreements, said a senior foreign ministry official. A few MoUs and instruments are proposed for signing during the visit and the two sides have already exchanged the list, including the text of a joint communique to be issued after Oli’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang on December 3 in Beijing. A joint taskforce comprising representatives of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML has drastically revised the implementation plan and trimmed it down to focus on specific projects, according to leaders. Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba will leave for China on Thursday. During her meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Chengdu, Rana will convey the message of the Oli-led coalition government and present Nepal’s terms and conditions, said a Nepali Congress leader privy to the developments. Ruling partners Congress and the UML have held extensive discussions over the past couple of weeks on how Nepal should pursue an agreement with Beijing on the BRI’s implementation. Members of the taskforce met on Wednesday evening to finalise the revised text on the BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side which is now revisited by the ruling party leaders.Prime Minister Oli is scheduled to visit China on December 2 and Foreign Minister Rana’s trip to the north is to lay the ground for that.The Congress and the UML have reached an understanding that Nepal should seek grants to fund specific projects under the BRI, which will be listed in a new MoU, said the Congress leader. The joint task force comprising four members—two each from Congress and UML—under the guidance of Prime Minister Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, has reached a tentative agreement to sign a new MoU on BRI in Beijing. The name and content of the proposed agreement has been kept secret by both sides.“The new MoU on BRI implementation will focus on specific issues and projects required at present,” said a member of the task force, adding, “The original text of the BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 has been revised drastically and it will be handed over by Foreign Minister Rana to her counterpart Wang in Chengdu.”“There is no need to include every detail or ambiguous language in the agreement that could lead to multiple interpretations. We want to see BRI as a development cooperation vehicle that will focus on projects related to connectivity, infrastructure and energy,” said the taskforce member.In her meeting with Wang, Foreign Minister Rana will discuss the new BRI understanding, projects to be funded under the BRI framework, and preparations for the prime minister’s visit, said a foreign ministry official.Rana’s three-day official visit follows an invitation from her Chinese counterpart Wang, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kathmandu stated. The foreign minister is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Wang on Friday. According to the ministry’s statement, the two leaders will have comprehensive discussions on matters of mutual interests. At a function on Wednesday, UML Deputy General Secretary Pradeep Gyawali said Nepal should clearly communicate with the Chinese about our common interests. “If our interests do not align with theirs, we should politely decline the Chinese proposals,” said Gyawali. “Discussions and deliberations in Nepal are polarised between grant versus loan for undertaking BRI projects and this is not right,” he added. “Any foreign assistance should not be seen through the lens of political ideology. We should see the conditions attached. If the grants come with conditions, we should decline. On the other hand, we are not in a stage of taking loans in a way that will put pressure on our economy. If our economic growth was satisfactory, we could take the loan, but with our economic growth struggling to reach four percent, we cannot sustain debt and its servicing,” said Gyawali. Congress leader Prakash Sharan Mahat, who as foreign minister led the BRI negotiations with China in 2017 and signed the MoU on BRI, echoed similar views. “Be it India, China, the US or any other country, any economic cooperation should be based on bilateral negotiations and should meet the conditions of both sides,” Mahat said. “We should not get carried away thinking that China or India or the US will be unhappy with us since we did not take economic cooperation and assistance on their terms and conditions.”“If we follow this principle of taking economic cooperation and assistance on our terms and conditions, that will not create any difficulties,” he said at an interaction held at the Centre for Social Inclusion and Foreign Policy.“It took me over seven months to finalise the MoU of BRI in 2017,” said Mahat. “We did a lot of homework and prepared the draft after removing several proposals sent by the Chinese side.” \nAmid sluggish progress in law promulgation, the Legislation Management Committee of the National Assembly has decided to conduct a detailed study of the laws needed for the full-fledged implementation of the constitution promulgated around a decade ago.The committee has formed a five-member sub-committee led by Beduram Bhusal, a CPN (Unified Socialist) lawmaker to assess the progress made in law promulgation and also find out how many laws, and from which sector, still need to be enacted. The sub-committee has been given a month for the study and submit a report.The committee, after a similar study last year, had found that only 111 laws among the 151 required to implement the 2015 constitution had been enacted by July 2023. It had pointed out that 40 Acts needed either major amendments or replacement to bring them in sync with the constitution.Appearing before the upper house, then prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, had said the government was serious towards drafting the necessary bills and registering them in the federal parliament. But his government failed to walk the talk. The incumbent government too has not made serious attempts to introduce these necessary bills.“The sub-committee will study what progress has been made since last year,” said Tulasa Kumari Dahal, chairperson of the House committee. “It will study minutely as to which ministry needs which laws to implement the constitution.”Once the Bhusal-led panel submits its report, the House committee will hold discussion with the prime minister and relevant ministers. “We will try to seek explanations for the delay and instruct the government to expedite the preparations of the necessary bills,” she said.The constitution had set two deadlines to prepare laws for its implementation. It mandated the passage of laws related to fundamental rights within three years of the charter’s promulgation. The federal parliament endorsed the bills related to 31 fundamental rights a day before the constitutional deadline of September 19, 2018.As per the statute, the Acts that contradict the constitution must have been revised within a year since the first meeting of the federal parliament on March 5, 2018. Though several laws were enacted, dozens are still waiting for parliamentary approval.One major constitutional mandate involves devolving authority to manage school education from the federal government to local governments. However, the federal education law has yet to be enacted. Similarly, the federal civil service bill is also stuck in a parliamentary committee.Other crucial laws, including those related to health, citizenship and the authority of the President and Vice President have also not been enacted.The report says some of the laws in force date back as far back as 1953. Similarly, dozens of Acts are from the Panchayat era (1961-1990). For instance, the Education Act from 1972 and Infectious Disease Act from 1962 remain in force.In its report, the House committee had instructed the government to revise the Panchayat era laws to align with the present day needs. However, little progress has been made in this regard.It is the government that prepares bills and registers them in parliament. They become the Act, only after they get through both the Houses of the federal parliament and receive the Presidential seal. The government, however, solely is not responsible for the delay in having the necessary laws in place. Failure of the House committees in readying the bills to be tabled for the endorsement too is equally responsible for the delay. For instance, different House committees are sitting on 16 bills for months. Despite repetitive instructions from Speaker Devraj Ghimire, the House panels also called mini-parliaments have not been active.The upcoming winter session of the House, known as bills session, is likely to be without substantial business because neither the House committees have finalized the pending bills nor has the government registered new bills. It has been more than four months since the last bill was registered.  \nThe conflict between the Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah and leadership of the ruling party, the CPN-UML, seems to be deepening as the two sides show no sign of rapprochement.In the latest episode, the KMC has fined the ruling UML Rs100,000 for littering the streets of the capital city Kathmandu while holding a mass meet on Friday. Within hours of the conclusion of the UML’s ‘Awakening rally against anarchy’ at Durbarmarg in downtown Kathmandu, the KMC made public a decision saying that the city office had fined the ruling party.But the UML leadership took serious exception to the mayor’s action. “It can be understood that Kathmandu Metropolis Mayor Balen [Balendra] has been used [by someone] against the CPN-UML, which has become clearer after the issuance of today’s ‘pamphlet’,” UML General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel wrote on Facebook a few hours after the issuance of the city office’s fine notice. He claimed that members of the rally organising committee were busy cleaning the area on their own when the metropolitan officials issued the notice.KMC representatives reached the UML party office in Chyasal on Sunday to hand over the receipt of the fine issued on Friday. After the party refused to receive it, the notice of fine was sent to the party office by email today (Monday), said Nabin Manandhar, KMC spokesperson. UML’s office secretary, Bhisma Adhikari, denied the allegations that the party littered the street during the rally. If there had been rubbish, our cadres would have cleaned it up. Adhikari said, “But the KMC issued a notice against us to defame our party, which is a politically motivated action.” Adhikari also stated that his party wouldn’t pay the fine and that the party office had not received any mail from the KMC. The City’s assistant spokesperson, Dhurba Kumar Kafle, differs. Kafle says a team from the environment department and the metropolitan police were present at the demonstration venue. It was only after inspecting the ground that the KMC slapped a fine, he said.Political observers say the KMC has been selective in imposing the fine. They, however, criticised the party for disrupting the traffic on Friday, badly affecting people’s daily lives.“Picking a party to impose a fine but turning a blind eye to similar activities carried out by other parties shows the City’s bias,” Keshav Dahal, a political analyst, said. “To prove they are not biased, the KMC from now on should penalise other political forces and groups as well for carrying out similar activities.” For the past few months, the streets of Kathmandu have witnessed many protests by various political parties. Before the UML, the main opposition party, CPN (Maoist Centre), organised a protest rally on October 26 in Kathmandu. Until recently, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) was in the street, holding multiple street protests in Kathmandu, claiming the arrest of their party chief Rabi Lamichhane was politically motivated. The City spokesperson Manandhar denied the allegation of being biased. “When the other parties had organised protests, the KMC did not see the necessity of issuing a fine as there was less garbage,” Manandhar said. “But the UML’s gathering compelled us to issue a notice of fine.” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, however thinks both the UML and the KMC are engaging in stunts.“The City issued a fine against UML and the UML put up a vehement denial after being imposed a fine. Both were doing stunts,” Subedi said. But it would have been more mature of the UML to respond to the KMC as per existing laws, he added.“If there is a lack of a policy in this connection, the UML could have vowed to bring the policy so that such incidents can be better handled in the future,” Subedi said.On April 9, the KMC had fined the Rastriya Prajantra Party (RPP) Rs5,000 for littering the streets of Kathmandu while staging a protest. Recalling the episode, Nilkantha Kafle, the treasurer of the RPP, said that the party had paid the fine.“We realised that we could have made a mistake by not cleaning up the streets after demonstrations. So we paid the fine,” Kafle said. Political analyst Subedi reckons the latest incident could be the result of bitter relations between UML chair KP Sharma Oli and KMC mayor Balendra Shah.Of late, Prime Minister Oli and other leaders from his party have been engaged in one after another dispute with Mayor Shah. On June 3, Shah accused Oli of engaging in ‘policy corruption’ by being involved in illegal land swap of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in Jhapa. After that, then deputy prime minister and minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth tried to halt the mayor’s plan to widen pavements in the Capital’s New Road area. Mayor Shah even sent metropolitan workers to dump a truckload of dirt in front of the office of the road department, which is under Mahaseth’s ministry.In September, Mayor Shah criticised Prime Minister Oli for failing to take action against UML provincial assembly member Rekha Sharma, who was accused of abusing a child domestic worker for eight years.“The court has also decided to prosecute the accused,” Shah wrote on Facebook. “Respected prime minister, good governance entails taking action against your lawmaker accused of domestic violence.”“Perhaps to you, good governance is limited to announcing a compensation of Rs100,000 and shedding crocodile tears on Facebook over her death,” Mayor Shah wrote on the social media post. Previously, the UML and Mayor Shah had argued for and against implementing the Supreme Court ruling that ordered vacating the Bagmati riverside land.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nDharahara, which reopened to the public on Constitution Day this year, has started charging entry fees from Sunday. Over 90,000 people have climbed the new iconic tower for free since it opened on September 19, but visitors will now need to pay Rs200 per person. Students, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities will be given a 50 percent discount.The Ministry of Urban Development said a fee for visitors from SAARC countries is Rs500 per person, while those from non-SAARC countries will have to pay Rs1,000 each. Entry into the Dharahara premises will cost Rs50. Fees for commercial activities are higher. For instance, it has been set at Rs5,000 per hour for videography, Rs1,000 per hour for photography, and Rs5,000 per hour for non-commercial advertisements on the Dharahara tower. Prakash Aryal, director of the Central Project Implementation Unit (Building and Housing) under the ministry, said that visitors may sometimes face delays as the new system is in the initial stage of implementation. “The time required to manage operations after implementing the fee system might cause delays for those climbing Dharahara,” Aryal said. Visitors can access the tower between 10am and 4pm, but operating hours may be adjusted later. The historic tower will remain closed every Wednesday.The International Convention Centre in New Baneshwar will look after the management until a dedicated committee is formed.The government has declared Dharahara and five other structures, including Jhapa’s Damak View Tower, as ‘special structures’. The Urban Development Ministry has issued an order to facilitate their operation under a public-private partnership model, proposing to lease their management to private entities through competitive bidding. “Minimal fees have been introduced to cover operational expenses such as utilities, staff salaries, and maintenance,” said Mani Ram Gelal, secretary at the ministry. “The state does not intend to make a profit, only to recover costs.” He said it would take at least four months for a private operator to take over once the process is completed. “We cannot provide free access indefinitely, as there are expenses for water, electricity, and staff. While not seeking profit, the fees will help cover operational costs,” said Gelal. Aryal said that by adjusting the schedule and deploying more staff, up to 3,000 visitors could be accommodated daily. “Daily crowds were overwhelming during the free entry period,” he said. “Now we’ll see how the visitor numbers change after introducing fees.” The rebuilt tower, equipped with two lifts, still faces occasional technical problems. Leaks during Tihar, caused by an improperly closed door at the top of the tower, temporarily affected the lifts, but the issue has since been resolved. Online ticketing is expected to be introduced within a month. “Until then, visitors will need to buy tickets at the site,” Aryal said. The Dharahara reconstruction is nearly complete, but some electrical work remains pending. Aryal assured us that the pending work would not affect visitors climbing the tower.The iconic structure, which is historically taken as a major landmark of the capital city Kathmandu, was destroyed by 2015 earthquake. The tower, located at the heart of the City, was rebuilt and reopened to the public nine years after the natural disaster. \n\nWomen and young girls, once excluded from the tradition of playing Newari musical instruments, are now taking the lead in preserving and revitalising the centuries-old Newari musical tradition.One such example of change is the Lubhoo Dhaa Khala, which, according to its members, is the oldest Dhaa group in Lubhu of Lalitpur district. This group performs especially during jatras and other major Newari festivals.The group now boasts a new batch of around 40 musicians, 20 of whom are women and girls. These individuals are mastering the percussive Dhaa and Khin, and the cymbals Tah and Bhusya, instruments historically reserved for men.The group’s performances have now become a central part of local festivities, especially during the Gunla festival—a month-long celebration marking spiritual reflection and cultural devotion.The musical instrument Dhaa is central to the festival’s observance. Known as the Gunla baja, the Dhaa is revered as the Buddha’s favourite instrument and is believed to bring good luck and prosperity when played around chaityas and temples.“In the past, Newari instruments like the Dhaa were associated with male musicians, creating an exclusionary tradition,” says Bekh Narayan Shrestha, the head teacher of Lubhoo Dhaa Khala.However, as social attitudes evolve, so do the practices surrounding these cultural symbols. Women are now claiming their rightful place in this heritage, learning and performing with great panache.Bekh Narayan also says that while in the past playing this instrument was reserved for the higher Shrestha caste, today, caste is no longer a barrier—anyone can be a disciple.Concerned about the traditional instruments nearing extinction, Bekh Narayan took the initiative in 2000 to establish a group and personally began teaching students.While the Lubhoo Dhaa Khala began as a male-dominated group, its evolution into an inclusive space for women is an example of progress. Mandevi Shrestha, 38, who is Bekh Narayan’s daughter, is one beneficiary of the group’s outreach.“I was always a rebel,” Mandevi says. “I put pressure on my father, who was the group’s teacher, to teach us girls as well. I told him, ‘If boys in my own home can learn to play it, why can’t I?”Mandevi adds, “My persistence paid off, and in 2014, five women learners were included in the boys group.”When some women who had joined in 2014 migrated after marriage, the number of women in the group dwindled. At the time, conservative societal attitudes discouraged many women from learning alongside men. Moreover, the women were often not given priority. This led to a temporary halt in teaching women.However, over time, as more women expressed interest and the teachers faced pressure from within their own families—with their daughters and female relatives also wanting to play—by 2017 the group formally began recruiting all-female batches.“When we first started, there was evident discrimination,” says Ashmita Pradhan, 23, who started learning the instrument in 2014 and has been teaching all-female batches since 2017. “Women were not seen as equals then. I’m glad to see things have improved. Nowadays, young girls join the group with full family support.”The change is most evident in the current generation of musicians.Prayusha Shrestha, an 11-year-old student at Future Star Academy in Lubhu, began learning Dhaa in 2023. “After school, I would rush to finish my homework and run to the training sessions,” she says. “I was always excited to learn.”Another student, 20-year-old Sarishma Shrestha, adds, “From childhood, I listened to these instruments. But at the time, participation of girls wasn’t encouraged. When I finally got the chance last year, I was elated.”The inclusion of women in Lubhoo Dhaa Khala has inspired a new generation of learners, some of whom are under 10 years old. While others like Samira Shrestha (25), Neshana Shrestha (24), and Kriti Shrestha (23), have been playing since 2017. This trio belongs to the second batch of female learners, trained by Pradhan herself.According to Samira, in the past, when they played during jatras, there were very few women involved. Despite the judgmental stares, they played with confidence.“Today, the number of girls has increased significantly, and it’s great to see women and girls reclaim their space in preserving our culture, heritage, and music,” Samira says.However, there are still hurdles.According to Mandevi, some instruments, like the Khin, are still predominantly taught to men. “We’re advocating for change,” she says, “so that these traditions become fully inclusive.”For teacher Bekh Narayan, preserving Newari music goes beyond gender inclusivity.He emphasises the need for financial support to sustain the tradition. “Instruments are becoming more expensive,” he says. “We’ve introduced a donation box so even students can contribute, even if it’s just one rupee. We need support from the local government too.”Currently, in the Khala, only the girls from Lubhu are part of the group. So they are now planning to include married daughters-in-law as well.“This will help preserve our culture while empowering homemakers with Newari musicianship, ensuring the culture is passed down generations,” Bekh Narayan says.The members of Lubhoo Dhaa Khala believe their efforts go beyond cultural preservation.Sarishma notes that traditional instruments like the Dhaa enrich Nepal’s musical heritage. “They add diversity to the nation’s music scene, which is often overshadowed by modern and western influences,” she says.In Lubhu, the beats of the Dhaa are no longer produced by just one gender or generation.“Ten years ago, when there were few women, our dedication was often questioned,” Pradhan says. “Now, with more young girls joining, we feel empowered.” \n\nIntrepid DMC Nepal said it has received certification as a “Great Place to Work”, an honour for organisations that foster positive workplace cultures.The company said in a statement that this recognition emphasises its unwavering commitment to creating a people-centred environment where employees thrive through stimulating interactions, career growth opportunities, and a strong sense of inclusion and belonging.This prestigious certification, awarded by the globally renowned Great Place to Work® Institute, is a testament to the company’s dedication to prioritising employee well-being, professional growth, and collaboration. “We are thrilled to receive this recognition,” said Ashish Verma, country general manager of Intrepid DMC Nepal. “At Intrepid, we believe that creating a positive work culture is the foundation of our success. This certification reflects the hard work and passion of our incredible team, whose commitment to excellence inspires everything we do.”Intrepid DMC Nepal, part of the Intrepid Travel Group, specialises in offering unique, responsible, and immersive travel experiences. The company’s focus on sustainability and ethical tourism is mirrored in its workplace ethos, which encourages employees to align personal and professional goals with meaningful impact. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Governors unanimously elected Masato Kanda as ADB’s 11th president. He will assume office on February 24, next year.Kanda, 59, has forty years of experience in international finance and policy and currently serves as Special Advisor to Japan’s Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. He previously served as Deputy Commissioner at the Financial Services Agency, Deputy Director-General of the Budget Bureau, Deputy Vice-Minister for Policy Planning and Coordination, and Vice-Minister of Finance for International Affairs.Kanda holds a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Tokyo and an M.Phil in Economics from Oxford University.Chair of the ADB Board of Governors and Governor of the Bank of Italy, Fabio Panetta, said, “Kanda’s extensive experience in international finance and proven leadership in multilateral settings will serve ADB well in navigating complex global economic challenges and fostering international cooperation.”Kanda has been actively engaged in international forums like G7 and G20, addressing key policy challenges such as the evolution of the multilateral development bank, pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, and debt sustainability and transparency.  \nUjjwal Kumar Shrestha is the executive director of Panchakanya Group, a diversified manufacturing company that has built its reputation over 52 years by specialising in quality and reliable building materials. Beyond manufacturing, the group has ventured into hydropower, trading, construction, and limestone mining, reflecting a diversified portfolio. Shrestha entered Nepal's corporate world in April 2007, when he joined his family business as a marketing manager in the steel and plastic divisions after his return from the US. Shrestha, who believes that no job is big or small and that whatever you do, you must put your heart into it, worked in a cafe in the US. He has always believed that a strong team brings a lot of positive synergy and high consistency, which helps attain goals more competently than through individual efforts. In an email interview with the Post, Shrestha discusses Nepal's current economic situation and challenges, including the company’s plans. Excerpts:As one of Nepal’s oldest business groups, how do you observe the business climate then and now?Despite political instability and labour management challenges, Nepal’s business environment has evolved in the last two decades. Yet, we saw a resilient and hopeful community of businesspeople as we went through the political transitions and drafted our constitution for a stable Nepal. The policies and processes lacked appeal, but financing was accessible, and the consumer market was gradually expanding. Consumption of infrastructure products was slow but showed steady growth with increased manufacturers' capacity utilisation and a healthier competition environment.Then, the 2015 earthquake brought devastation. However, along with the destruction, it brought opportunities to build a more robust and better Nepal through a stable government and improved infrastructure. We saw many commitments from the government for infrastructure-related projects and a surge in industrialisation and new business ventures. As always, in the private sector, without much homework, we started crowding our market to tap into the opportunity of new Nepal until Covid hit us. Covid and its aftermath have been the most significant learning curves for most of us as the pandemic and its effects took many lives and cost businesses. Yet, the crisis forced most firms to realign and innovate.As a third-generation business leader, I believe today’s business climate faces unprecedented challenges and lacks confidence. Overcrowding in markets due to similar imports and products manufactured much above the demand have resulted in supply glut. The central bank’s abrupt and overly conservative policy precaution has severely hampered businesses with no time to align with an overbearing regulation post-Covid, which gradually was loosened, but the damage had already been done.The volatile interest rate makes long-term planning frustrating and challenging, especially while planning and projecting your business year-on-year. This is still prevalent in doing business today. The government’s budget spending has always been poor, and it’s the same now. Persistent underutilisation of budgets hampers demand and has left Nepal behind in regional infrastructure development. Multi-party governments contribute to policy corruption and instability by creating unclear and conflicting policies. Our business community takes advantage where it fits, frustrating and damaging our economy. The cost of doing business has shot up significantly due to labour costs and delayed payments from the market and the state, creating additional financial strain.To invigorate the business climate, it is time for the government systems to become more digitised and faceless, with less bureaucracy at every step and a focus on policy clarity. The business community must be held accountable and motivated to contribute rather than feel beleaguered. All stakeholders must unite and bring transformational changes in Nepal, a country blessed with nature and immense human potential.The country’s economy is not in sound health. How is the Panchakanya Group doing?We have faced and adapted to numerous political, geopolitical, and natural disasters or the pandemic’s challenges throughout our industrial journey. Each setback has been a learning experience, helping us consolidate and sustain our operations.The aftermath of Covid-19 severely impacted Nepal's business landscape, including our group. While the pandemic was challenging, the subsequent financial policies deepened the difficulties. The restrictive and abrupt policy measures made navigating a strained economy even trickier, damaging businesses and slowing overall economic recovery. However, the crisis taught us invaluable lessons, compelling us to adapt and realign our strategies to survive and sustain.In my 19 years with the group, I have never witnessed an economy as stagnant and challenging as it is today, both financially and morally. The prolonged economic slump has dampened people’s hopes and drives to grow and their vision of national prosperity anytime soon.For the Group, sales have shrunk, and capacity utilisation has decreased significantly. Frequent and unpredictable policy changes in industry regulations and financial frameworks have kept us on edge.The lack of political stability and the prioritisation of politics over economic development has eroded confidence in the government and its ability to foster economic growth. The road ahead is uncertain, but our resilience and adaptability, built over five decades, will guide us forward.Since Nepal started exporting iron and steel to India, how is the demand in the Indian market? What difficulties is the company facing in the export process?Nepal's iron and steel industry makes various products, but only a few are manufactured locally for export. Among the prominent exports are corrugated sheets, some household items, and wire products, though the volume of other exports remains negligible. Panchakanya Stainless Steel tanks have also entered the export market, with small quantities being sent to India. Efforts are underway to expand this market and increase export volumes.In 2022, the government introduced an incentive scheme to promote exports, mainly targeting steel and cement industries with an 8 percent export incentive. This policy generated significant enthusiasm among manufacturers. Cement exports to India have been highly successful due to Nepal's abundant raw material, making production and export viable. However, steel exports have faced challenges. For instance, following the introduction of the incentive, only three truckloads of steel rebars were exported in 2022.The challenges in exporting steel and iron products stem from several factors. Nepal relies heavily on raw material imports from India and third countries, making production costs high. Additionally, the industry is hindered by poor electricity infrastructure, unreliable supply, rising labour costs, fluctuating interest rates, and unstable government policies, all of which making large-scale exports unfeasible.Under the Nepal-India trade treaty, Nepali products receive preferential treatment for export to India, provided they meet the requirement of at least 30 percent local and Indian value addition if the raw material originates from third countries. Furthermore, certain products must obtain Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification to qualify for export. While exporting to India is generally hassle-free, the competitiveness and cost-efficiency of Nepali industries remain critical factors. Unfortunately, these industries face numerous uncertainties, limiting their ability to capitalise on export opportunities.As a multiple manufacturing group, how is the company working on environmentally sustainable manufacturing practices? What are your plans for that?Panchakanya Group has always been and will remain deeply committed to integrating environmentally sustainable practices into its manufacturing processes. We focus on minimising our environmental footprint throughout every stage of our product life cycle while maintaining operational efficiency. We have consistently adopted green, clean, and lean practices across all our manufacturing units in Nepal, such as energy-efficient technologies. We use advanced process equipment to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, maximise raw material usage, and minimise waste.We have adopted an online automatic air-oil lubrication system that drastically reduces lubricant consumption, minimises discharge, and ensures eco-friendly operations. We adopt an automatic excess oxygen control system. This technology optimises combustion, reduces pollution, and minimises material wastage.Our commitment to the \"3R Policy\" (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) ensures maximum production efficiency while minimising waste. Additionally, we practice zero air, water, and electricity leakage in our manufacturing processes. We use only premium raw materials such as prime billets and virgin plastic to enhance output, improve quality, and reduce process losses and waste.In October 2024, we achieved a significant milestone by becoming Nepal’s first company to receive the GreenPro Type-1 Ecolabel for Panchakanya Steel. This certification recognises products that meet the highest standards of environmentally friendly practices. We take pride in being the greenest manufacturing facility, reducing our carbon footprint through green initiatives and planting over 4,500 trees in and around our industrial complex in Kotihawa, Bhairahawa.We aim to expand and enhance our green movement through several initiatives like expanding our existing 194 kW solar facility to over 1MW across plants and offices, planting more trees in available spaces to support the environment, adopting eco-friendly raw materials and energy solutions, encouraging digital practices to reduce paper usage and achieving zero water wastage by reusing recycled water.We aim to explore alternative fuels and the latest technologies to minimise environmental impact further, reduce waste, and increase efficiency.How does the company align with the UN sustainable development goals?Panchakanya Group has significantly aligned its operations with the UN SDGs. Key initiatives include creating jobs to combat poverty, ensuring productive and decent employment opportunities at its units, promoting sustainable consumption and responsible production, investing in environmentally friendly technologies, and prioritising the development of green products. These efforts showcase the group’s commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility.Further reinforcing its dedication, the Panchakanya Group contributes to five significant causes through its CSR arm, the Panchakanya Foundation. These initiatives include environmental protection, education, skill development, health and sanitation, and preserving culture and heritage.Why is there not a single woman on your company’s board?Panchakanya Group is deeply committed to fostering diversity and inclusion at all levels of its organisation. It takes pride in the rich diversity represented across its workforce, encompassing gender, culture, and religion.As a family-owned business, the group has been evolving, transitioning from traditional, family-centric management practices to a more professional and structured approach to governance. While the current leadership framework, shaped during the early stages of the company’s foundation and growth, does not yet include female representation at the board level, the group acknowledges the importance of gender diversity in leadership roles.We are optimistic about embracing broader inclusivity, including more excellent female representation in decision-making. This commitment reflects its forward-thinking approach to fostering a culture that supports equal opportunities, aligns with global best practices, and promotes sustainable and inclusive growth for all. \nAbout seven in 10 people in the country are facing health issues because of smog with the most common symptoms being cough, flu and breathing difficulties, according to a report by international insights firm Ipsos.The recent smog situation was declared a “calamity” in Punjab last month. According to the international Air Quality Index Scale, an index value of 300 or higher results is “hazardous” to health and Pakistan has regularly tipped over 1,000 on the scale.Around two million people visited medical facilities across Punjab with breathing problems and other respiratory diseases in a month as record-breaking smog choked the province.The Ipsos survey, titled “Smog in Pakistan: Awareness, Perceptions and Practices” and dated November 26, was conducted from Nov 18 to 22 using computer-assisted telephone interviews with a sample of 1,000 people from all four provinces and Islamabad.In its first section on people’s awareness and experience with smog, data showed that eight in 10 people, around 79 per cent of the sample size, experienced smog over the last month, with 100pc of the sample in Lahore experiencing it.It also revealed that 68pc people reported having smog-related health issues with 71pc in urban areas and 67pc in rural.The survey also highlighted the effect of smog on daily life, stating, “Over one-third Pakistanis found their daily household activities, work life, and social events being affected by smog.”It further said that Punjab was the worst hit among all provinces, adding that Lahore and Rawalpindi were most affected.According to the second section on people’s beliefs and perceptions, when asked about the primary cause of smog, 70pc of respondents said vehicular emissions, 63pc said industrial smoke and 37pc said waste burning. About 31pc chose brick kilns and 30pc crop burning, followed by one in five who believed it was the “wrath of God”.The data showed that 44pc of the people saw a lack of public cooperation and 37pc believed enforcement of law as the barriers in combating smog and air pollution.In the last section on actions and behaviours, the data showed that eight out of 10 people agreed that they needed to play their part in combatting smog. It also said that men, elderly and highly educated Pakistanis were more willing to cooperate, indicating that those who were more informed were likely to take responsibility.When asked to choose personal actions to reduce smog, 48pc said they were ready to switch to walking, 31pc chose public transport, 29pc chose bicycles and 10pc opted for new/hybrid electric vehicles.The report stated that out of 796 people who owned vehicles, “nine in 10 Pakistanis are ready to cooperate if they were asked to repair their vehicles and get certification from the government — a clear sign for the government to play its part in this regard.”According to the survey, three in five people were satisfied with their provincial government’s approaches to battling smog. However, it found that satisfaction decreased as the education level increased, which raised concerns about the relevance, priority and effectiveness of the government’s strategies in addressing smog.-In Association with ANN \nAmid a decline in temperatures, the number of people suffering from influenza and other respiratory ailments has risen. Hospitals treating respiratory patients say there has been an increase in flu and other respiratory illnesses compared to a few days ago.“A rise in cases of respiratory illnesses during winter or at the time of season change is not uncommon,” said Dr Ram Hari Chapagain, a senior consultant paediatrician at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. “Parents should not take these problems lightly, as children can sometimes develop severe symptoms.”Seasonal influenza is also highly contagious. It mainly affects the lungs and spreads quickly in communities. Its symptoms include fever, cough, body aches, and in some cases, vomiting and diarrhoea, and pneumonia.Pneumonia, an infection of the lungs caused by various types of bacteria, viruses and fungi, is the leading cause of death among children under five in Nepal. It kills more children annually than malaria, tuberculosis and HIV combined. According to the World Health Organisation, pneumonia accounts for 15 percent of under-five mortality.Doctors say pneumonia caused by bacteria is deadlier than that caused by viruses, and children under five and people above 65 years of age are highly vulnerable to the disease.Thousands of people across the country contract pneumonia every year. The average cost of hospitalisation for pneumonia is Rs13,250, which is nearly half the average monthly household expenses in Nepal, a study by Pneumo Nepal shows.The study—which was carried out at Patan Hospital, Kanti Children's Hospital, Mission Hospital in Palpa, Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj, and BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences—shows that unexpected medical costs often push families into poverty.Doctors warn that if seasonal influenza is left untreated, it can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Doctors say seasonal influenza affects not only children but also comorbid and elderly people equally.Although Nepal has no system in place to track influenza infections, severity, and deaths from influenza viruses, many people get severe infection from the disease, according to them.“We don’t know exactly how many people get infected, develop severe symptoms, or succumb to seasonal influenza each year in Nepal, as we do not maintain detailed records,” said Dr Anup Subedee, an infectious disease expert. “But the fact is small children, elderly people and those with underlying conditions are highly vulnerable.”Experts say most children recover within a few days of infection, but the virus could be severe to elderly people and those with underlying conditions.“The number of people suffering from seasonal flu, or influenza, has risen of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The increased flow of patients at pharmacies also indicates a rise in influenza cases.”Doctors say the number of people infected with seasonal influenza could be far more than recorded, as not all cases reach hospitals and undergo testing. Sometimes, even doctors do not think it necessary to carry out testing as there is no specific treatment for the infection.The seasonal influenza virus causes respiratory complications, mainly affecting the lungs. Experts say early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection and complications. Patients recover early if treated promptly. However, the severity of the disease and deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time.“Those who can afford to pay for influenza shots should get inoculated themselves along with children, elderly and people with comorbidities,” said Pun. “The influenza vaccine prevents severe infections.” \nThe Ministry of Health and Population has decided to inspect medical bills issued by health facilities following growing complaints from patients and their families about exorbitant charges, particularly in private hospitals. Patients and their relatives have also complained that private hospitals and medical colleges often do not inform them about fees at the time of treatment, only to impose excessive charges during discharge, according to officials.“We have received several complaints from patients and their relatives about the excessive charges by health facilities, and such complaints are growing every day,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesperson for the ministry. “We have already directed all health facilities, including medical colleges, to publish their fee structures on their websites.”Officials said Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel himself expressed concern about these growing complaints and instructed officials to regulate the charges.As per the ministry’s circular, health facilities must disclose outpatient department charges, bed fees, surgery charges, and lab fees, among other things.“We have also requested health agencies under provincial and local governments to regulate health facilities,” said Budhathoky. “They are requested to check if patients are being overcharged by health facilities.”Health officials said they are also planning to audit doctors’ prescriptions to see whether unnecessary medicines and tests are being prescribed. For this, the ministry plans to seek help from professional councils such as the Nepal Medical Council, the Nepal Pharmacy Council, and other agencies concerned.Experts say most ailments can be treated with medicines costing just a few hundred rupees, but some doctors force patients to buy vitamin supplements costing thousands of rupees. Patients and their relatives have also lodged complaints with the ministry about doctors' alleged wrongdoings and collusion with health facilities. They also complained that some hospitals force patients to undergo unnecessary tests costing high fees.Officials at the health ministry hope that an audit of doctors’ prescriptions will help address patients' complaints and grievances. Prescription audit is a systematic analysis and is in practice in many countries across the globe. It is carried out to find errors in doctors’ prescriptions and improve patient care.Officials say the decision to carry out a prescription audit was made to discourage malpractices involving doctors, pharmacists, importers, drug manufacturers, and hospitals.Under pressure from hospitals, patients are often made to undergo unnecessary and costly tests or are kept admitted in hospitals longer than necessary.An official at the ministry, asking not to be named since he is not authorised to speak to the media, said the Department of Drug Administration has banned certain vitamin supplements prescribed by doctors and sold openly in the market in combinations with specified solutions and agents.Some doctors and dispensaries have been taking undue advantage of poor patients, forcing them to buy additional vitamin supplements, the official said, adding that most patients are unaware and don’t ask if the supplements are necessary.Medical experts say that vitamin supplements are only needed in specific conditions, but most doctors prescribe them unnecessarily.Experts hope the prescription audit will help minimise irrational prescribing, improper dispensing, unnecessary testing and the practice of taking undue advantage of ailing patients. \nMalaysia should introduce pneumococcal vaccines for adults and high-risk groups following the steady rise in pneumonia-related deaths, say health experts.While pneumococcal vaccination is already part of the National Immunisation Programme for children, they said there is no such programme yet for adults, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions.Federation of Private Medical Practitioners’ Associations Malaysia president Dr Shanmuganathan Ganeson said Malaysia should integrate this vaccine as it has great public health benefits.“Many countries have successfully reduced pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality by integrating pneumococcal vaccines. Malaysia should follow suit.“It will help reduce hospital admissions by preventing severe pneumonia and invasive diseases, decrease healthcare costs by minimising complications and intensive care needs, and promote herd immunity by lowering bacterial transmission to protect unvaccinated individuals.“Cost-effectiveness studies in other nations suggest that national-level vaccinations could have a long-term economic benefit alongside improved health outcomes,” he said in an interview yesterday.Calling pneumonia a “highly avoidable disease”, Dr Shanmuganathan noted a rise in pneumonia-related deaths, particularly in 2021, due to Covid-19.“Even after recovery, some individuals experienced secondary bacterial infections, further increasing pneumonia risks,” he added.He pointed out that strained healthcare capacity also delayed treatment for other respiratory conditions.At the same time, an ageing population and prevalent non-communicable diseases like diabetes and heart disease heightened pneumonia risks.“The rise of antibiotic-resistant strains like Streptococcus pneumoniae has complicated treatment.“Also, the lack of widespread adoption of the pneumococcal vaccine, especially among high-risk groups, leaves a significant portion of the population vulnerable,” he said.Dr Shanmuganathan said the pneumococcal vaccine effectively reduces the risk of severe pneumococcal disease.He added that the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) can prevent up to 80% of invasive diseases in children.“For the elderly and high-risk groups, the vaccine significantly lowers the risk of complications and death.“Its efficacy varies depending on the individual health status and the vaccine type – either the PCV or the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV).“Importantly, it offers protection against antibiotic-resistant strains of pneumococcus, addressing a growing concern.“Malaysians, especially high-risk groups, should get the pneumococcal vaccine available in hospitals and clinics.“This includes children under two, adults over 65, those with chronic diseases and the immunocompromised,” he said, adding that increasing the awareness of the benefits of the vaccine and its availability at most clinics is important.With pneumonia now the leading cause of death, Dr Shanmuganathan said it is essential to update the Covid-19 vaccination programme, focusing on new variants like XEC and vulnerable populations.He emphasised that a broader respiratory health strategy is needed, including promoting pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations and ensuring early diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections.“Private general practitioners should be kept informed of these developments.“The Health Ministry must remain proactive, despite diverting staff to address the doctor shortage in clinical sectors,” he said.Association of Private Hospitals Malaysia president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said while Covid-19 infections may have been reduced, influenza cases are rising, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) becoming more recognised as a significant infection.As such, he said the government should consider including pneumococcal vaccines in Malaysia’s national vaccination programme.The vaccines, he added, should also be made readily available at private medical facilities and selected clinics.“Such a programme should be introduced as it would help reduce morbidity and mortality, especially in the high-risk population.“Vaccines should be made widely available to reduce the cost and burden of treating illnesses,” he said.Dr Kuljit suggested that those in the high-risk group consider getting vaccinated to better protect themselves against pneumonia.He said private medical centres are currently using the latest vaccine, Vaxneuvance, which helps protect against 15 types of pneumococcus.The cost of pneumococcal vaccines ranges between RM280 and RM400, depending on the type used.When asked, Dr Kuljit said the steady rise in pneumonia-related deaths in the past decade could be from the large number of high-risk populations due to the nation’s ageing population and those suffering from non-communicable diseases, which result in compromised immune systems.He also said the increase in cigarette and e-cigarette smoking could also be a factor in the rise of such cases.Smoking damages the cilia (tiny hair-like structures) in the respiratory tract that help clear pathogens and debris.“This dysfunction can lead to a higher risk of respiratory infections, including pneumonia,” he said.-In Association with ANN \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral's background in environmental science and artistic sensibility imbue her baking creations with unique offerings from jams to cakes, advocating for a zero-waste policy while sharing three easy-to-bake recipes.\nAmidst Kathmandu's urban sprawl, the historic village of Khokana preserves its ancient architecture, temples, and mustard oil mills, providing a glimpse into Nepal's medieval past and the resilience of its cultural traditions.\nA woman's journey to Everest Base Camp amidst changing climate and personal challenges, leading to a transformative experience and a reflection on life's meaning, limits, and value of existence.\nA group of journalists embarked on a 1,000-kilometer tour of Sri Lanka, visiting heritage sites, religious monuments, and scenic landscapes, while exploring the challenges and recovery of its tourism industry in the wake of recent economic and political struggles.\nVarious cultural and natural attractions in Nepal, including Mundhum Trek, Janaki Mandir, Kuri Village, Annapurna Base Camp, Bardiya National Park, Khaptad National Park, and Limi Valley, offer unique experiences and stunning landscapes.\nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nAmateur Rahul BK won the Surya Nepal Central Open, the first event under Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, at the par-72 Gokarna Golf Club on Thursday.BK carded 5-under 67 in the fourth and final round for a total score of 12-under 276.He registered a one-stroke victory over overnight leader Toran Bikram Shahi to claim maiden career title.BK also bagged the amateur section title with a five-stroke victory over Nepal number one amateur Sadbhav Acharya.BK, who began the day four strokes behind, carded 4-under 32 on the front nine to catch Shahi, who took the turn at even-par 36.

He was later charged with espionage.“Sentencing Yuyu to seven years in prison on no evidence declares to the world the bankruptcy of the justice system in China,” Dong’s family said in a statement provided to Reuters.“Today’s verdict is a grave injustice not only to Yuyu and his family but also to every freethinking Chinese journalist and every ordinary Chinese committed to friendly engagement with the world.”The family added that in the court judgment, Japanese diplomats whom Dong met were “specifically named as agents of an ‘espionage organisation,’ which is the Japanese embassy in Beijing”.Dong’s conviction implied every Chinese citizen would be “expected to know that the Chinese government may consider those embassies to be ‘espionage organisations’”, it said, causing a chilling effect.Police guarded the court on Friday, with seven police cars parked nearby, and journalists were asked to leave the area. A US diplomat said they had been barred from attending the hearing.Dong has been detained in a Beijing prison since a closed-court hearing in July 2023, the press club said in September.“Chinese authorities must reverse this unjust verdict, and protect the right of journalists to work freely and safely in China,” said Beh Lih Yi, Asia program manager at the Committee to Protect Journalists.“Dong Yuyu should be reunited with his family immediately.”Dong regularly had in-person exchanges with diplomats from various embassies and journalists.The Japanese diplomat he met, one of two he had regularly met in the past, was also detained for several hours, spurring a complaint from Japan's foreign ministry.At the time, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the diplomat was engaged in activities “inconsistent with their capacity” in China. The diplomat was later released.A Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 2007, Dong was a visiting scholar and visiting professor at Keio University and Hokkaido University in Japan, his family said in a statement in April 2023.He joined the Guangming Daily, affiliated to the ruling Communist Party, in 1987, after graduating from Peking University law school, and was the deputy editor of its commentary section.He wrote opinion articles in Chinese media and liberal academic journals on topics from legal reforms to social issues, and co-edited a book promoting the rule of law in China.His articles advocated moderate reforms while avoiding direct criticism of President Xi Jinping.His family had initially kept news of his detention private in the hope that charges could be reduced or dropped, but were told in March 2023 that he would stand trial, they said in their statement.Non-government bodies (NGOs) advocating press freedom have called for his release, with more than 700 journalists, academics and NGO workers signing an online petition for him to be freed.“Dong Yuyu is a talented reporter and author whose work has long been respected by colleagues,” said Ann Marie Lipinski, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard.“We stand with many in hoping for his release and return to his family.”In February, a Beijing court handed a suspended death sentence to Australian writer and pro-democracy blogger, Yang Hengjun, on espionage charges. \nFifteen people have died and at least 100 more are missing after a landslide triggered by heavy rains buried dozens of homes across several villages in eastern Uganda, the prime minister’s office and police said on Thursday.The landslide occurred on Wednesday in Bulambuli district, about 300 km (190 miles) east of the capital Kampala.At least 40 households were completely buried, the Uganda Red Cross Society said in a statement, while others were partially damaged.“We have 15 dead and fears are that there are many more bodies still buried,” said Charles Odongtho, spokesman for the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) which overseas disaster response work.He added that more than 100 people were still missing across eight villages.“We are shocked that it was this devastating,” Odongtho said. He said all bridges in the area had been swept away and roads inundated by water.Police said that 113 people were missing and that impassable roads were preventing vehicles, including ambulances, from conducting rescue operations.Uganda has been hit by unusually heavy rainfall since October that has triggered widespread flooding and landslides in some areas.On Tuesday torrential rains caused the River Nile, the main branch of which runs through Uganda, to burst its banks and flood a highway connecting Kampala to the country’s northwest, according to the Uganda National Roads Authority and police.Large swathes on the slopes of Ugandan mountains have been denuded of their forests and other vegetation cover for cultivable land, increasing the risk of landslides.The area where the landslide occurred is mountainous and has experienced similar disasters in the past, including an avalanche in 2010 that killed at least 80 people. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nChina celebrated the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Republic of China in 1959. A Nepali delegation also visited the country to participate in the celebrations conducted by the Chinese Communist Party. Surya Bahadur Thapa, a minister in the interim government formed by King Mahendra, led the Nepali delegation.At the end of Thapa’s sojourn to China, his Chinese interlocutors informed him that Chairman Mao would grant him a meeting. Thapa was advised to carry three messages to King Mahendra. First, Mao informed Thapa that the Chinese were not in a race with India to provide developmental assistance to Nepal. Second, he assured that China would not let anyone compromise issues related to Nepal’s sovereignty. Finally, Mao said that Thapa must advise the King to maintain good relations with India to ensure political stability in Nepal. Leading a semi-retired life half a decade later, the octogenarian Thapa was curiously observing the evolving politics of the peace process, which marked a gargantuan shift in Nepali society. Pushpa Kamal Dahal had just resigned as prime minister over his failed attempt to depose the army chief in 2010. At this point, he seemed hellbent on soliciting China’s support to return to power. After losing power, Dahal visited the northern neighbour with a plan to counter India. This was Dahal playing the China card in Nepali politics in the early phase of the peace process. After returning to Nepal from his China visit in 2011, Dahal’s trusted China hand Agni Sapkota declared China’s prophetic advice to the visiting Maoist delegation: To mend ties with India for stability in Nepal. Thapa observed that great powers seldom change track at provocations insinuated by political frictions of Nepali leaders. He also witnessed that China had upheld its tested Nepal policy for over 50 years since different regimes in Nepal continued with their commitment to the One China Policy.Interestingly, China’s ambitious global outreach in recent times has compelled analysts to examine whether its policy is evolving towards deeper engagement in Nepal. For instance, many analysts have characterised the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a geopolitical initiative that aims to provide strategic leverage over other countries. BRI is a signature foreign policy of President Xi Jinping, which was announced in 2013 to connect China closer to the world through infrastructure and investment projects. Unsurprisingly, Beijing would want Nepal to be a part of President Xi’s ambitious foreign policy gambit. While Nepal signed the BRI Framework Agreement in 2017, Beijing is now pressing Kathmandu to move forward with the BRI implementation plan. Given the heightened geopolitical rivalry, including in the SAARC region, the BRI implementation plan was bound to face scrutiny in Nepal. The fact that the document has not been made public and the details of the plan remain elusive gives way to rising speculations on the negative aspects of the proposed plan. In a democracy, process and content fundamentally determine the course of bilateral or multilateral treaties. As in Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the proposed implementation plan should have been made public to allow for debates, enhancing the understanding of the agreement. Also, the government, in the Parliament’s absence, could have called an all-party meeting or referred the plan to the international committee of the Lower House of Parliament. MCC received bipartisan support since Nepal’s parliament endorsed it after many rounds of deliberations and amendments. Therefore, as Nepal builds on its relationship with its neighbours, the political leadership in Kathmandu should provide space to open debates on the policy choices it intends to initiate. More importantly, Nepal must strive to achieve bipartisan support on critical issues impacting its external relations, especially with its neighbours. As Nepal’s economy struggles due to political instability, bilateral and multilateral funding will continue to play a pivotal role in fueling growth. However, there are genuine concerns regarding BRI that should be clarified. It is widely reported that BRI has led to unsustainable debt in several countries, and the bad debt incurred through its funded projects has seriously impacted their economies. Sri Lanka and Pakistan are perfect examples in the region, illustrating that large infrastructure projects with high interest rates plunge the economy into a crisis with high debt-to-GDP ratios. This situation leads to unstainable levels, eventually producing a balance-of-payment deficit and a large-scale financial crisis that triggered protests in Sri Lanka.Nepal must prudently select projects that it can repay, and the borrowing rates must be on par with what the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank Group offer for financing infrastructure projects in the country. In simple words, we must bite what we can chew in terms of envisioning big-ticket infrastructure projects that require enormous amounts of capital. Another aspect of the implementation plan that was criticised was how the plan covers an entire range of areas of cooperation, including law enforcement and other areas unrelated to infrastructure development. Any imbalance in Nepal’s foreign policy will be watched closely by Nepal’s friends on the global stage. Coincidently, Donald Trump’s NSC designate recently visited Kathmandu, which reinforces Nepal’s geopolitical importance. The BRI implementation plan, in its current speculated form, has broader strategic and geopolitical implications. There seems to be no clarity on the requirement of the plan for BRI projects, as countries worldwide haven’t signed it. Therefore, the rationale for Nepal signing the agreement is largely questionable at this stage. At all costs, Nepal must avoid sending a signal that it has chosen a particular geopolitical camp. Advocates of the implementation plan mention that this is only an in-principal document. If so, the political leadership of Nepal must evaluate that by conceding Nepal’s principled position on seeking grants or concessional loans at the World Bank and the ADB rates. Observers will question the neutrality of the in-principal stand taken to endorse the document. Those opposing the plan in its present form will continue to argue that once a country loses on principle, what else is there to lose?Nepali politicians and policymakers at the strategic level should realise Beijing has moved ahead from the traditional way of looking at Nepal. Nepal should assess whether China has shifted the goalpost and its commitments by introducing a non-essential implementation plan as one of its priorities—from a geopolitical perspective—and what it means for the country. Moreover, Kathmandu’s position should be to seek the implementation of past announcements and promises. Lastly, Sino-Nepal relations are of historical importance, and therefore, they cannot be reduced to dividing political forces in Nepal. Nepali politicians need to improvise their foreign policy positioning by understanding that state-to-state relations are becoming more transactional and that each nation will aim to expand its leverage over the other. It is time an aspiring Nepali woke up to the reality of cutthroat competition for influence in international relations.  \nGreen finance isn’t a foreign concept for Nepal or its banking industry. Nepal’s financial sector's investment has been by default in the hydropower sector for years. However, these investments lacked clear definitions and parameters. With Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) recent introduction of a comprehensive green finance taxonomy, that is about to change. The Nepali banking sector is expected to undergo substantive and sustainable changes, redefining investment standards.This new taxonomy marks an important step towards instituting clear provisions on green investments. It serves as a structured system to classify sustainable economic activities, offering local and international investors the market clarity they need to make informed, sustainable decisions.As Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari noted, “The adoption of a dedicated green finance taxonomy is crucial given the pivotal role of private and public finance in tackling climate change.” This is an important step toward creating a well-defined green finance landscape in Nepal. It helps reduce ambiguity and strengthens Nepal’s position on the global map of sustainable finance.The core of a green finance taxonomy is clarity. By defining what “green” means in Nepal, NRB’s taxonomy guides banks and investors on where to direct their funds. Without this clarity, “greenwashing”—where investments falsely claim to be eco-friendly—can occur. This new framework reduces that risk by setting clear standards, giving investors confidence that their money supports genuinely sustainable projects.The taxonomy also prioritises green finance for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and focuses on gender. NRB’s structure closely follows international best practices, aiming to make sustainable finance accessible, transparent and essential to Nepal’s economy. It brings multiple benefits such as reducing environmental risks, strengthening the energy sector and supporting the financial sector’s shift to a green economy.Benefits for banksThe green taxonomy is a significant enabler for Nepali banks. It provides a clear and structured system of classifying green projects, making it easier to create financial products that support environmental goals. This shift helps banks direct funds more effectively into green sectors. Previously, banks invested in green areas without a standard framework; now, they have official guidelines to align with sustainable and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards.Moreover, this taxonomy is designed to support projects on various scales, focusing on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and smaller-scale adaptation projects. This is especially relevant for Nepal, where small businesses form a substantial portion of the economy and often face challenges accessing finance for sustainable projects. By enabling banks to tailor green finance products for MSMEs, the taxonomy opens up new pathways for these businesses to contribute to Nepal’s green transition.More FDINepal’s clear green finance framework isn’t just a boost for its banks; it’s a signal to the world that the country is open and committed to sustainable foreign investment. Global investors increasingly prioritise sustainability and seek out countries with strong green finance policies. NRB's new taxonomy signals to the international community that Nepal is serious about transparency and environmental responsibility, showing an appealing climate for foreign direct investment (FDI).As green finance standards continue to tighten worldwide, NRB’s taxonomy places Nepal on par with international benchmarks. This allows for global investors to back up Nepali projects. By aligning with global expectations, Nepal becomes a destination for the kind of FDI that promotes both economic growth and environmental care.NRB’s leadership in developing the green taxonomy has been impressive. The bank has taken thoughtful steps to ensure the taxonomy is comprehensive, inclusive and tailored specifically to Nepal’s needs. Working with central banks across the region for peer review has further strengthened its credibility among foreign investors.This taxonomy will open the door to financial products that support clean energy, sustainable farming, waste management and more. These financial tools are essential for managing climate risks and building resilience for a country like Nepal, where environmental challenges are closely linked to economic growth.Perhaps the most impactful aspect of NRB’s green taxonomy is its forward-looking approach. This isn’t just about guiding today’s investments into sustainable projects; it’s about setting a strong foundation for a resilient green economy in the future. The taxonomy encourages banks to consider both climate mitigation and adaptation, ensuring that Nepal’s financial system can support a sustainable future in a world facing increasing environmental challenges.But successful implementation of the green taxonomy is not without challenges. Currently, the banking sector lacks the capacity to evaluate green projects. In addition, the regulatory framework must evolve to dissuade greenwashing. Ensuring sustained coordination between government agencies, development partners and the private sector to realise the true intent of this policy is a must. In a market like Nepal's, there is a need for a concessional and blended finance mechanism to reduce the cost of borrowing and the risk for financial institutions. Establishing clear standards enables local and international investors to fund projects that align with Nepal’s environmental and economic priorities. With this move, NRB has shown true leadership on the climate front, setting a regional precedent in sustainable finance. \nThe formal implementation of federalism in Nepal began after the three-tier elections in 2017. As it completes its seventh year, the journey to effective implementation remains fraught with challenges. The recent Kantipur Conclave (November 13-14) brought together the chief ministers of all provinces to discuss the progress, hurdles and opportunities in federal governance in a session titled “Face to Face with Chief Ministers”. Their insights shed light on the practical realities of federalism, revealing gaps in legislation, administrative autonomy, fiscal federalism and intergovernmental relations.Chief ministers highlighted several shared concerns about federalism's implementation. Hikmat Karki, Chief Minister of Koshi Province, said that provinces are given a “treasure bag without money,” referring to the lack of fiscal autonomy. He pointed out that while Koshi Province has made progress, such as reforming the vehicle licensing system, it still faces significant barriers due to the absence of enabling legislation and institutional support from the federal government. Similarly, Satish Kumar Singh, Chief Minister of Madhesh Province, echoed the frustration over the gap between rights and resources. He compared Nepal’s federalism with India’s, highlighting how Indian states are empowered with resources and authority to implement their mandates. Singh called for more clarity in resource allocation and legislative framework and emphasised the need for regular evaluation and accountability for civil servants.The struggle for autonomy and functionality is not confined to these provinces. Chief Minister Bahadur Singh Lama of Bagmati Province pointed to a lack of laws governing exclusive and shared powers as a fundamental issue, despite his province achieving over 70 percent budget utilisation. Surendra Raj Pandey of Gandaki Province articulated similar concerns. He metaphorically described how federalism is stuck in a “2G framework” while governance demands have moved into a “5G era”. Pandey emphasised that the delayed enactment of critical federal laws, such as the Federal Police Act and the Education Act, prevents provinces from functioning effectively. He criticised the centralised mindset of political leaders and bureaucrats, which stymies the progress of federalisation.Acting Chief Minister Bhumeswar Dhakal of Lumbini Province stressed that provinces are the backbone of federalism and pivotal for connecting government to the people. He expressed frustration over the federal government’s failure to release grants on time and clarify shared powers. Meanwhile, Yam Lal Kandel of Karnali Province focused on the need for equitable resource allocation. He criticised the centralised governance model, arguing that it perpetuates disparities between provinces. Kandel called for timely legislation and structural alignment to enable provinces to fulfil their constitutional mandates and address development gaps.Kamala Bahadur Shah, the Chief Minister of Sudurpaschim Province, shed light on bureaucratic resistance. He shared an anecdote where a government secretary denied provincial authority but exerted control when operating in Kathmandu. According to Shah, this duality highlights the reluctance among bureaucrats to embrace federalism. He urged leaders to adopt a federal mindset and foster collaboration to strengthen governance at all levels.Despite challenges, chief ministers also shared some successes and opportunities. For example, the vehicle licensing reform in Koshi Province and Bagmati Province’s high budget utilisation demonstrate that provinces can deliver tangible results when given authority and resources. However, these isolated successes cannot mask the persisting systemic issues across provinces.At the Kantipur Conclave, their concerns were similar to those raised during programmes organised in all provincial capitals by the Federalism and Localization Centre, facilitated by the chief ministers’ offices in September 2024.Federalism is a shared responsibility, and its success depends on the collective efforts of federal, provincial and local governments. Chief ministers emphasised that the federal government must lead by example, demonstrating a commitment to federalisation and creating an enabling environment for provinces to thrive.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli also addressed the conclave, emphasising the government's commitment to enacting laws that will provide reasonable powers to the provinces in line with the constitution. In response to concerns raised by the chief ministers regarding the lack of essential resources, such as financial autonomy and police powers, Oli acknowledged that the federal government has yet to enact laws that would fully empower the provinces. However, he assured that such laws would be made to ensure that provinces receive the rights they are entitled to.Prime Minister Oli's message, however, was not entirely encouraging for the provinces. He suggested that rather than focusing on “Sanduk ra Banduk” (fiscal resources and police authority), provinces should prioritise working with ideas and enthusiasm. Drawing on the example of Mahatma Gandhi, who achieved monumental change without weapons or fiscal resources, Oli emphasised that “thoughts” and “enthusiasm” are key to progress, suggesting that provinces should cultivate a mindset of innovation and dedication rather than waiting for more powers to be granted.While his statement reflected optimism and a call for action, it highlighted a more cautious approach toward empowering the provinces, contrasting with the urgency the provincial leaders expressed.The insights shared by the chief ministers at the conclave serve as a roadmap for strengthening federalism in Nepal. Their voices underscore the need for clear laws, robust institutions and a commitment to federalisation and inclusivity. Addressing legislative gaps, empowering provinces with resources and authority and fostering a decentralised mindset are critical steps toward realising the promise of federalism.As Nepal navigates its federal journey, these lessons must guide its path toward more effective and equitable governance. By tackling the systemic issues collectively, Nepal can fulfil the promise of federalism and build a governance system that serves its diverse population. The conclave provided a platform for these critical discussions, and it is now up to the stakeholders to act on these insights and strengthen the federal framework. Federalism in Nepal remains a work in progress, but with concerted efforts, it holds the potential to transform governance and empower provinces to become engines of development and inclusivity. \nThe annual United Nations climate summit, COP29, where nations discuss the future of climate, wrapped up last Sunday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Even as nations fought hard to reach a fair deal, the conference ended with a new climate finance target or New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) of at least $300 billion a year by 2035. Some representatives stood from their seats and applauded; however, delegates from developing nations felt insulted and labelled the $300 billion a “paltry sum” as it is simply not enough to address their mounting climate concerns. Even though the pledge has tripled from the previous target of $100 billion, which expires at the end of this year, it is less than the $400-$900 billion that many developing countries demanded from wealthy nations. The NCQG serves as a financial tool for justice, holding developed nations accountable for a climate crisis that disproportionately affects poorer countries. Yet, the escalating climate crisis each year has not been matched by a proportional increase in climate finance to address it. According to a 2024 OECD/IEA report, only $179 billion of the $1,265 billion tracked in global climate mitigation and adaptation finance from 2021-22 went to developing nations, with just $30 billion allocated to the least developed countries (LDCs).Developing nations like ours need this fund to adapt to climate change as they progress. Climate change impacts are not equally distributed. Nepal is one of the most climate change-vulnerable countries globally, although it contributes a negligible 0.02 percent share of global carbon emissions. This means that the climate-induced disasters the nation is grappling with, like floods, droughts, heatwaves, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), and so on, are outcomes of global climate change, a crisis fueled mainly by the inaction of nations with substantial carbon footprints. This is the sad reality of several South Asian nations: By 2050, Bangladesh will lose 17 percent of its territory due to rising sea levels, around 90 percent of India lies in extreme heat danger zones, and Pakistan became the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change last year according to Global Climate Risk Index. Considering our susceptibility to climate change, platforms like COP are vital to inform the world about our experiences and demand the compensation we deserve. Nepal’s COP-29 priorities this year focused on safeguarding its mountains, ensuring promised climate finance, enhancing access to climate funds, and urging the expedited implementation of the loss and damage fund established last year. Under the leadership of President Ramchandra Paudel, Nepal conducted a high-level session on climate change, during which he talked about the impacts of the melting of snow in the mountains. Nepal’s participation in the previous iterations of the UN climate summit hasn’t been that impressive. Negotiating and presenting on such platforms require experience, research and preparation. More than anything, it demands sensitivity towards climate change, which our leaders seemingly do not possess. Besides setting an NCQG, this year’s COP also delivered global standards for carbon trading and mandated all 195 Paris signatories to announce more ambitious emission targets by February 2025. However, concerns over Donald Trump’s re-election as the US president overshadowed these developments at the summit. The US, even though it is the world’s second-largest emitter after China, withdrew from the Paris Agreement during Trump’s first term. Although climate finance this year did not meet the expectations of developing nations, it cannot be rejected, especially with the rise of right-wing politicians who are indifferent to the climate crisis. Regardless, Nepal must strengthen its domestic climate change policies and enhance its negotiating and communication skills internationally. It should also collaborate with other developing nations that are experiencing the negative impacts of climate change. It is time we stopped ignoring the elephant in the room.  \nKarnali Province has worryingly become synonymous with tragic road accidents, with deaths and injuries getting far too frequent. We aren’t even halfway through this fiscal year, and as many as 48 people have already died on Karnali’s roads. According to the Provincial Police Office in Surkhet, just in the second week of November, 17 accidents resulted in 12 fatalities and 132 injuries. And in the past five years, a total of 666 people in the province died for the same reason. This alarming data hints at systemic negligence and calls for immediate remedial action.Karnali’s rugged topography is well-known, presenting natural challenges to smooth transport. But the blame for these accidents cannot be attributed solely on the province’s layout. In areas with a limited number of vehicles, reckless bus operators overload them, which contributes to accidents. Recently, a five-seater jeep jam-packed with 32 people crashed at Raduneta of Palata Rural Municipality-3 in Kalikot district, killing seven and injuring 13 others. Moreover, the vehicle operators tend to deceive the police by asking some passengers to get off the bus at security check-posts so the overcrowding goes unnoticed. The passengers are left with no option but to accept such wretched conditions, often out of necessity. The vehicle operators also justify their actions by claiming they cannot bar people who want to get inside packed buses, especially on routes where public transport is scarce. Such problems could have been averted if the province had good roads and enough vehicles. The Karnali Highway was blacktopped eight years ago, but the asphalt has eroded in sections, making accidents more likely. Inaugurated in 1992 and operated in 2007, the state of the highway remains sub-par and inadequate to meet the province’s demands. Besides the Karnali Highway, Rapti, Mid-Hill Highway and other road sections also need upgrade and widening. Landslides during the monsoon obstruct these roads and pose danger to travellers. This absence of proper road infrastructure has not just affected the local people but also harmed Karnali’s tourism prospects and undercut its development aspirations. There isn’t much interest, either at the federal or provincial level, in improving the state of Karnali’s roads. The focus of elected officials seems to be to open new tracks on unstable soil just to show that development has ‘arrived’ in Karnali. The region’s challenges are examples of systemic neglect. While it is commendable that many remote areas are now connected by roads, these paths should also be relatively safe and easy to traverse. Given such a large number of deaths and injuries, the federal and provincial governments should prioritise road safety as a matter of urgency. Drivers, police and passengers—none of them can escape their responsibility while blaming the others for the accidents. They would all be better served if they joined hands to put pressure on governments to enhance the quality of roads and collaborate with the private sector to bring more vehicles to the province. Monitoring and supervision activities along the stretch of the Karnali Highway, where most accidents take place—from Bangesimal in Surkhet to Khalanga in Jumla—should be another priority. Nowhere in Nepal should people have to put their lives on the line while travelling for essential business.  \nPrime Minister and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli likes to project an image of a decisive leader. This much-valued leadership trait often works to his advantage. Yet when he makes decisions on the fly, it can backfire just as often. This past Friday, the UML held a mass gathering in the national capital in order to “raise awareness against anarchy”. Many found it curious that the party leading the national government would call for such a gathering: Shouldn’t the prime minister be focusing on delivery and leave all the protests and rallies to opposition forces? The real reason behind the rally, as party insiders put it, was the UML’s desire to “project strength” at a time of widespread public disenchantment. The rally and the eventual gathering at Durbar Marg, it was hoped, would send an unmistakable signal to other political forces that the party is still a potent force capable of mobilising big masses at short notice. Such a show of strength had apparently become vital after much smaller forces like the Rastriya Swatantra Party and even some troublemakers associated with Durga Prasai were seen hitting the streets in order to “sow anarchy”. The Friday event turned out to be dud. The party had expected at least 100,000 to turn up; the actual crowd was much smaller. In any case, Oli and other top UML leaders who addressed the Durbar Marg gathering had little of substance to say. For instance, the prime minister spent considerable time denouncing the RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane and his supposedly dubious character. This was rum as Lamichhane is currently in police custody and facing a series of criminal charges. Moreover, the RSP protests against Lamichhane’s arrest have already fizzled out. So, instead of promising no government intervention on investigations against Lamichhane and others arrested on charges of cooperatives fraud, why continue to hound a jailed and much-diminished political opponent? Whatever Oli’s intent, it betrayed a deep sense of insecurity vis-a-vis Lamichhane and even the smallest forces that have criticised his government leadership. This wasn’t a display of strength, either from Oli or the UML. It was rather an inadvertent show of weakness which the party’s political opponents will greatly relish. Any way you look at it, the gathering, organised on a weekday and at great inconvenience for commuters, was unnecessary, nay, a nuisance. Again, it is hard to read Oli, and perhaps whatever purpose he had in mind has been served. But most folks are left scratching their heads. The head of government, instead of governing and trying to silence his critics through delivery, is seen spewing venom against his political opponents at a rally that seemingly no one except him wanted. There is also a sense of unease among the people. Our prime minister and his party seem incapable of taking criticism and if someone raises a question, they will try to shout down the questioner. Ironically, the protest against anarchy itself turned out to be rather anarchic: Lacking a purpose, horribly organised and disturbing people’s daily lives.  \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is preparing to visit China in the first week of December. It will be his first bilateral visit after assuming the office in mid-July. Nepali prime ministers generally go to New Delhi first. Sudheer Sharma, former editor-in-chief of Kantipur daily, has recently published a pair of books on Nepal-China relations—‘Himalpari ko Huri’ and ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’. He also frequently writes on Nepal’s relations with its two big neighbours. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Sharma on the eve of Oli’s China visit. Prime Minister Oli is all set to visit China next month. Many find it curious that he decided to go to Beijing first before visiting New Delhi. How do you see this development?Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have given high priority to visits and engagements with our two neighbours–India and China. This is natural. Generally, the prime ministers first visited India and then went to China. I believe Prime Minister Oli tried to do the same. We see regular engagements with New Delhi at various levels. Prime Minister Oli had met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in the last week of September. In August, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India and met Prime Minister Modi and her counterpart S Jaishankar, among other key officials there. But Delhi has yet to extend the invitation to the prime minister. So he seems to have decided not to defer his foreign visits for long and chose to visit Beijing first. We have to see this in two perspectives. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and he is also going to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even in the past, Oli developed good relations with Chinese leaders. So, there are expectations that he may make the visit fruitful. An equally important concern is whether this visit impacts our relations with the southern neighbour India. I think the prime minister should focus on implementing the agreements reached during his previous visits to Beijing and during Chinese leaders’ Nepal visits. He should be mindful of not irking the southern neighbour while reaching any agreement with the northern one. I believe the prime minister is conscious of this.India often seems anxious about Chinese involvement in Nepal. Do you see any risk of this visit increasing the distance between Oli and India?Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited China first after he became prime minister in 2008. Even in the past, some Nepali prime ministers including Tanka Prasad Acharya went to China on their first official visit. This is not unusual. The two prime ministers—Oli and Modi—recently met in New York. India doesn’t seem ready to intensify bilateral engagements with Nepal immediately. So it is natural for the prime minister to increase engagements with China, without taking any steps that could provoke India. We should stop seeking Indian signals when dealing with China, and vice versa. We should maintain parallel relations with both the neighbours without antagonising any side.In this context, what should be the prime minister’s priorities during his China visit?We have to end our chronic problem of signing agreements and not implementing them. We make announcements and forget them. There are also some infrastructure projects China pledged to develop but there is little progress. So the prime minister should draw the Chinese leadership’s attention and press them to complete the projects on time. Some important projects such as Mugling-Pokhara and Narayanghat-Butwal road upgradation by the Chinese side have been slow, causing hardships to people. Even such issues should be communicated to the political level. Also, there are several commitments made by the Chinese government but left unimplemented. This creates an impression that China makes big promises but doesn’t keep them. Prime Minister Oli often highlights the Tokha-Chhahare road upgrade project under Chinese support but there is no satisfactory progress. Progress on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) on Nepal-China cross-border railway is unclear as well. Nepal expected some substantive support from China to make the Pokhara international airport financially feasible. Some concrete steps are needed to operate this airport. There are reports that the government has requested China to convert the loan taken to develop the airport into a grant and the prime minister will push for this during his visit. It will be an achievement if the prime minister succeeds in this. In the course of writing your recent books, you extensively interacted with Chinese officials and experts, as well as with their Nepali counterparts. What are the major factors delaying the projects? Is it lack of preparation on the Nepali side or is there any problem on the Chinese side?First, we [Nepalis] sign agreements but don’t work seriously to implement them. This is true in the case of agreements with other countries as well. We are negligent. Red tape is another problem. Third, China gives less priority to small countries like Nepal as it has so many big issues with other countries. We have to constantly follow up with them to speed things up. In the past, the two sides agreed to open more border points. This should be expedited. The people-to-people relations on the border areas were historically based on social interactions at the community level. People used to trade, marry those from the other side and interact in various ways. Of late, despite progress on infrastructure development, social engagement has been hindered. This should be rectified and new border points should be opened at Dolpa, Mustang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Taplejung, and Sankhuwasabha. We should think beyond the Capital-centric approach. This will help strengthen relations at the people’s level and give alternatives in our connectivity. We should put connectivity at the core of our relations with the two neighbours. In the past decade, we have made good progress in improving connectivity with India. A study report has been prepared on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway project. We are building an expressway linking Kathmandu and the southern belt of the country. Integrated check posts (ICPs) have come into operation along Nepal-India border points. Cross border electricity transmission lines have been built and we have increased energy trade with India. We have thus progressed in deepening connectivity with India. We lack reliable north-south highways. Therefore, the prime minister should make connectivity a major agenda of his China visit. Given the lacklustre performance of past projects, can we be optimistic about big cross-border infra projects under Chinese help?Nepal and China have committed to run some projects under the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) concept. A key component of this concept is to upgrade connectivity between Kathmandu and Kerung that includes roads as well as a railway. The concept also envisions operating other border points. The railway project requires more study and investment and needs to consider various other factors. For now, we should prioritise opening the aforementioned border points. The Korala border point at Mustang has huge potential. Nepal is making a road that connects Mustang with the Sunauli border point with India. Centuries ago, people from Banaras used to travel to Tibet via Mustang through this route. It can be revived and made a trilateral trade route between Nepal, India and China. Similarly, Limi in Humla, Olangchugola in Taplejung, among others places, can be developed as alternative routes. As far as Kerung-Kathmandu connection is concerned, let’s first give priority to building a reliable highway. The railway project should be developed with a broader understanding between Nepal, India and China. Beijing will develop such a big project only with the big Indian markets in mind. More importantly, there are some signs of improvements in India-China relations. We have to use this as an opportunity.There are differences in the way we work and the Chinese do and there are systemic and linguistic differences as well. These factors are often blamed for lack of progress in development activities carried out with Chinese support. Can Nepalis work closely with Chinese, just like we do with Indians?Until a decade ago, several projects developed under Indian support were left in limbo. In 2015, India imposed a blockade against Nepal and that sparked anti-India sentiment. Then, India expedited several projects. This drastic change became possible as the political leadership in India realised its mistake and showed the commitment to improve things.But the same thing is not happening with China because there is a “great wall” between Nepal and China when it comes to understanding each other. The Chinese haven’t understood Nepali context. The northern neighbour should be more open and liberal in helping Nepal. Second, Nepal should also stop approaching China only when our relations with India sour. We have left this impression on the Chinese psyche. First, we should be clear about what exactly we want from China, forge consensus among major political forces and hold talks with the Chinese leaders. Then, we should be equally committed to implementing the agreements reached this way. People now take announcements of building big projects under Chinese support as propaganda. Therefore, this time the prime minister should stress on pushing the pending projects. The prime minister should tell them that even the projects announced during President Xi’s visit have not progressed and that has created a bad impression of China in Nepal.There are some differences between the coalition partners—the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress—about the funding modality of projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). Do you think this may cause a problem?The UML wants to expedite the BRI projects while the Congress has insisted that we should accept only grants and not loans under the BRI. The prime minister should clear such dilemmas and come up with common views before he leaves for Beijing. Once they come up with a common view on such key issues, it will give a positive and strong message. The Chinese side will take it more seriously because the strong government led by the two largest parties can implement bilateral agreements.We have instances of Nepal’s political parties standing for and against important projects funded by other countries. This was seen in the case of the US-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and China’s BRI. Moreover, in the past, the Chinese leaders created an impression that they preferred working with communist parties and leaders. This is neither in the interest of Nepal nor of China.There are also discussions on signing the BRI implementation plan during the visit. What are the things Nepal should be careful about while signing BRI-related agreements?Trying to get grants instead of loans is in itself good. But there is no need to be prejudiced against the BRI per se. Nepal reportedly wants to include some points specifying waivers in specific projects. We should be very careful while signing project-based agreements. For instance, what will be the conditions and funding modality of a project, will it be developed under grants or loans etcetera. All our technical experts and other brains should be engaged while signing project-based agreements and specifying conditions and other nitty-gritty to ensure that we will not have unnecessary liability and debt burden in the future. Over time, Nepal has rightly adopted a steadfast position saying that we don’t join a strategic alliance proposed by any country. It stayed away from the US government’s State Partnership Programme (SPP) and China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI) as well as from India’s security umbrella. But we can’t be isolated in development initiatives. We have to take support from India, China, the US and other countries based on our needs.Do you think the Chinese side will show magnanimity on Nepal’s requests, for instance on waiving off the loan to develop Pokhara international airport?Though the Chinese ambassador to Nepal last year claimed the airport project to be under the BRI, the case is different because it was signed years before we joined the BRI. And, converting that loan into a grant is not a big deal for China. They should show magnanimity given the support we have been providing to China for a long time. If you see things historically, Nepal has helped China by suppressing Khampa revolt, preventing free Tibet movements on our soil and showing a steadfast commitment to One-China policy. China, which is now prosperous, should definitely show magnanimity and waive off loan of Pokhara airport. They shouldn’t see relations with Nepal through a purely transactional lens.In your book, you describe 2008 as a watershed after which the engagements between Nepal and China increased drastically. But why couldn’t we benefit from the northern neighbour in terms of development?The Chinese side looks more interested in increasing engagement. They like to showcase their development before foreigners. But more than lavish hospitality, we need substantive support from the neighbour, which has emerged as the world’s second-largest economy. But we should be clear about what we want from our engagements with China.  The Nepali side doesn’t present its proposals clearly. On certain issues, our politicians give mixed signals. This time, if this government of two largest parties reaches a certain agreement with China and remains committed to implement it, other forces can’t hinder it. The same approach can be replicated while dealing with India, the US, Japan or other friendly countries.Is difficult geography still a barrier in developing cross-border infrastructure projects and deepening relations between Nepal and China?In our textbooks we read that the Himalayan range is a natural barrier between the two countries. In my book ‘Bhikshu Byapar ra Bidroha’, I have explored and described how people from Nepal and northern India had been traversing through these mountains and there were interactions and engagements between the people in this part of the world since the 5th and 6th centuries. So, the mountains weren’t barriers even at that time. Now technology has made things easier. We have to think about how to connect with these two big economies. We have multiple east-west highways. Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries. \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nOn Friday the weather in the hilly areas of Koshi province is forecast to be partly cloudy while the rest of the country is to remain mainly fair.Tonight the weather is to remain partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi and Gandaki Province and mainly fair in the rest of the country.
